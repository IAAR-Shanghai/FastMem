Contact a local foster care agency to learn more about what it takes to adopt a foster child, and what it's like. There should be an orientation which you can attend which provides you with an overview of the process.;\n, There is no single prototype for the \"perfect\" foster parents. In fact, they come in many shapes and sizes. But there are several things that set outstanding foster parents apart from the pack:\n\n\nFamily stability and personal maturity\nBeing a steady advocate for children\nBeing a \"team player\" with your family and your welfare worker, There are several misconceptions about who you need to be or what you need to have in order to become a foster parent.\n\n\nYou do not need to be married in order to become a foster parent\nYou do not need to own or live in your own home\nYou do not need to be wealthy\nYou do not need to already be a parent or have kids of your own\nYou do not need to be young\nYou do not need to be a stay-at-home parent\n\n, Before you officially begin the application process, states usually make you complete a pre-service training class designed to teach you about the sorts of challenges foster youth routinely face.These are free through your state agency and are usually scheduled at times that will work for people who work 9 to 5 jobs. These classes usually run 4 - 10 weeks, but states will vary.\n After you've completed your pre-service training, you'll be asked to start the (sometimes labor-intensive) process of filling out paperwork and due-diligence. During this phase, you may be asked to provide:\n\n\nIncome verification through your employer. (Again, you do not need to be wealthy to become a foster parent, and many expenses associated with the raising of foster youth are reimbursable.)\nCriminal record screening at all three levels \u2014 local, state, federal\nLetters of reference from your employer as well as from personal acquaintances\nAge verification by birth certificate or other legal means\n\n, After the pre-screening and pre-service training have been completed, you get to meet your caseworker. It's very important to get off on a good footing with your caseworker; be honest, open, and thoughtful about your experiences and your motivation behind becoming a foster parent. After you meet your caseworker and complete an interview with her, you'll be expected to do the following:\n\n\nBe responsive to the caseworker's requests in a responsible, timely, and open manner. Honor your caseworker's requests for documents and information.\nPledge to maintain confidentiality about children in foster care as well as the details surrounding their family.\nAccommodate your caseworker on required home inspections and criminal background checks.\n In some states, a home study is required. A home study is a document your caseworker compiles intended to learn more about you, your family history, and your personal relationships. A home study is conducted through a series of questions and interviews, and can last anywhere from three to six months. Generally, a home study includes:\n\n\nFamily background and any relevant parenting experiences\nEducation and employment\nPersonal relationships and social life\nInformation about your home and the neighborhood you live in\nYour reasons for wanting to foster parent and your readiness to do so\n\n, It can take upwards of a year from when you first contact the foster parent agency until you are given a foster placement.During the waiting period, while your caseworker is making their determination, it's a good idea to stay busy and receptive to any questions your case worker might have.\n\n\nDuring this time, do as much research as you can about the types of issues foster children will have. Some come into the system abused \u2014 sexually, mentally and physically \u2014 and this presents serious issues for the both the foster youth and parents.\nContact your state foster parent association and talk to other foster parents for insights and advice. Network with them and find out firsthand what's it's like to be a foster or adoptive parent.\nIf a caseworker comes to you with questions which you think may put your eligibility in doubt, never lie. If your caseworker believes you to be deceptive or dishonest, your eligibility will suffer. Most issues that come up can be worked around. The best policy is openness with your caseworker.\n Your local agency will require a number of safety features in your home, such as smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and the like. Don't let a simple oversight derail your plans so late in the game! Follow the safety recommendation for the child's sake and for yours.\n Your placement coordinator should give you information about how other children in your home could be affected by the placement, and what the chances of the child returning to its birth family are. It's important to remember that upwards of 50% of foster youth are reunited with their birth families after being placed in foster care \u2014 being a foster parent often doesn't last long!\n\n\nIf you are feeling weary, unsure, or unwilling to accept the placement, know that you have the right to back out of the placement request before it's finalized., While there are no requirements to be a foster parent concerning age, race, preference, gender, or religion, you must be able to financially support yourself and any members of your current household. Make sure you understand the financial responsibilities of being a foster parent.\n\n\nIn most states, foster children are covered with Medicaid cards, which includes medical, dental and counseling services.\nIf the child needs daycare, this is a cost you'll probably be responsible for. Again, this differs from state to state; some states include a monthly stipend for childcare.\n A few sets of clothes for the age group you are willing to care for, age appropriate toys, food, hygiene items, etc.\n Understand that the initial transition can be quite rough for the foster youth; not everything is going to be rosy right from the get-go. But with a little bit of gumption and a lot of patience and love, your foster youth should ultimately understand that your intentions are pure and that your love is real.\n\n\nForm emotional bonds with your foster youth, but don't expect them to stay for very long. Foster care can last a matter of weeks or months, but it rarely drags on forever. More than half of foster youth are eventually reunited with their natural parents.\nIf reunification with their birth parents is no longer possible, you may be able to adopt your foster youth. This may only happen after the legal rights of the parents have been officially severed.Continue to work with your caseworker to help meet the day to day needs of the foster youth. Stay in touch with your caseworker. They will help you better provide for your foster youth, if only with moral support.\n Give yourself some TLC. In order to physically, emotionally, and psychologically provide for your foster youth, you need to provide for yourself. To help avoid burning out, enlist the help of babysitters and respite care.\n\n\nIn most states, babysitters 18 or older can legally sit foster youth, although your particular state may have a provision against it. Ask your caseworker for more details if you are unsure.\nRespite care is a temporary handing over of the foster youth to another caregiver in order to give the foster parent(s) a break. Again, check with your caseworker for more information about respite care.\n\n"}

Children are very kinesthetic and love to do physical activities.;\n, When breathing out, the stomach should tighten. The shoulders and chest should never raise or drop. You can work on this standing, or lying with a book on their stomach. Then practice hissing, buzzing, humming and eventually singing \"Ah\" by preparing with a good deep breath and steadily supporting with the stomach. Focus on getting good, even sounds while exhaling that do not sputter or die off.\n Practice long glissando \"sirens,\" lifting up into the upper register (sometimes called falsetto or head voice) for high notes, rather than \"belting\" or straining in the speaking voice. Their high voice will probably be weak at first but insist on its use and it will grow stronger over time. Children should learn to recognize the sensation of vibration in their mouth and chest for low notes and in their head for high notes.\n Teach them to match pitch and then to sing steps going higher and lower. Begin by having them sing \"ah\" and match their pitch with the piano. Then explore a couple steps up and down. Since many children do not immediately understand the concept of raising and lowering pitch, it can be demonstrated by the raising and lowering of your hand. Be patient if they don't get it right away, they usually do soon.\n Begin to practice 3 and 5 note major scales, using the solfege syllables Do Re Mi Fa So. Transpose the starting note up and down by half-steps as far as they can hold the pitch. Once they make good progress, try the whole scale (Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do).\n Begin to work on major/perfect intervals beginning with seconds and progressing to octaves. Always use solfege syllables.\n Make sure the child sings each vowel with the proper mouth shape. Make sure they open their mouths enough for Ah and Oh and round enough for Oh and Oo.\n Instruct them to \"sing through a yawn\" but with their tongue flat behind their bottom teeth. Work on tone by asking them to focus the vibration on the roof of their mouth. This is especially effective by having them hum and asking them to maximize the vibration on the roof of their mouth. Tones in the upper register will feel like they vibrate above the roof of the mouth, in the head and even above the head when high enough.\n Practice sight reading by first singing in solfege while watching the contour of the notes. Begin teaching children to read music this way. Then move on to holding the vowel sounds out to the length of the notes (rather than closing them off quickly as in normal speech) and singing with pure vowels.\n Learning to successfully perform is one of the indispensable experiences in voice lessons. Frequently conduct informal performances where the child will sing an entire song, facing you. Encourage students to sing for their parents and even friends, if they are comfortable with it. Finally, hold a recital every 6 months or so for which they can prepare 1-3 songs to perform for parents and other students.\n\n"}

Here are some questions you can ask:\n\n\n\"How do you feel about falling in love?\"\n\"Do you think people can fall in love after being good friends?\"\n\n, Girls tell their friends almost everything. If you are too nervous to directly ask a girl if she has feelings for you, casually ask a friend she is close to. Be aware that once you start inquiring to friends, they will likely report what you said back to this girl. Here are casual questions you can ask:\n\n\n\"Do you know if she like anyone?\"\n\"Does she ever talk about dating?\"\n\n, If a girl finds a reason to constantly bring up your name, speaks positively of you when you are not around, or smiles when your name is mentioned, she has strong feelings for you.\n Build up some courage and ask this girl to see a movie with you, or grab dinner. If she dresses up, or puts on more makeup than usual, then she is trying to impress you. A girl who loves you will want to stand out in your eyes by looking great and being fun.\n\n"}

His hair may be tangled, unkempt, or greasy. He may have dirt on patches of his skin, or under his fingernails. Similarly, he may have skin-infections or rashes that seem to go unchecked. If you notice any of these signs, that child may have a neglectful parent., If the child seems like she always has some sort of illness, yet never seems to be taken to the doctor or given any medication, there is a chance that she is being neglected.\n A neglectful caregiver may forget to feed the child they are caring for. If this is the case, the child may seem malnourished--skinnier than normal or no visible growth of any kind. You may also notice if a child never seems to have a lunch or snack at school.\n Do they seem to be hygienic? Do they seem caring or invested in the child\u2019s welfare. Looking at the caregivers can often give you an insight into what is going on. If they caregivers are unhygienic, it makes sense that they would also pay little attention to their child\u2019s hygiene.\n Every parent hopes to give their child good education. So they make it a point to understand how they are faring in school as in academic performance, how they are getting along with peers, what kind of friends they have, if their child has fallen into bad company and bad ways, and taking time to meet the teacher and take her observations about their child. But if there is no picture of parent or caregiver in the education then there is something to be worried about.If a parent has been asked to come in to speak to the teacher several times and fails to show up, there is a chance that this parent does not care about their child\u2019s education and is in fact neglecting their child.\n If you notice a child coming late to school every day, or missing school often, approach the child and ask him why this is the case. If he says that he has to take care of making breakfast and doing his homework by himself, or he has to run errands on school days, there is a very good chance that this child is being neglected.\n Pay attention to the child\u2019s response when you ask her about her home life. If she does not want to talk about it or seems to think that parents and a home are not important, this might be a sign that she is being neglected.\n Often, when a child is neglected, he will develop an inability to grasp or show emotions. He may also have a hard time empathizing with others. Because of this inability to associate with others, he may have very few, if any, friends.\n\n"}

For example, with the appropriate clothing, you can continue running outside during the coldest months of the year.With the appropriate gear and an eye on the weather, a winter wonderland can be a great place for exercising.\n\n\nWith warm clothing, you can also bicycle in the winter months. However, you need to watch for ice on roads and trails. It may be a good idea to walk a path before you bike on it to make sure that it is free of ice.\nBe on the lookout for ice that can lead to an accident and injury.;\n, The winter months are a great time to go for walks. If you live somewhere that receives snowfall, winter walks can offer scenic beauty. Moreover, the fresh winter air can be refreshing and rejuvenating.With a warm coat, a thick cap, and a good pair of boots, you can continue to take long walks in the wintertime.\n\n\nMake sure that you dress appropriately and listen to the local weather. If it is dangerously cold outside or there is severe winter weather, stay inside.\nDepending on where you live and your local weather, you may be able to go hiking in the winter months. However, many state and national parks are closed in the winter. Also, inclement weather may make some trails unsafe or inaccessible. Be sure to check with local parks officials before hiking.\nIf you want to go for walks off the beaten path, you might consider snowshoeing. This will allow you to go for longer hikes on surfaces that have not been shoveled or cleared of snow.\n If you own a dog, visiting your local park is a great opportunity to get outside during the winter. You can walk your dog or play games like fetch. Plus, having a playful romp with your dog outside will keep both of you warm, too! If you bundle up properly, you and your dog can both enjoy the great outdoors during the winter.\n\n\nMost dogs\u2019 coats offer them natural protection against the cold.

If you do absolutely nothing else for your teeth, at least do this., When you eat and drink during a meal, the enamel on your teeth can soften temporarily. Brushing your teeth immediately after a meal means you may accidentally erode your enamel. Instead, wait for about an hour after you\u2019ve eaten before you brush your teeth. This will allow the saliva in your mouth to help neutralize the acid content and return your enamel to its normal strength., While toothbrushes come in variety of bristle stiffness, you should always use a soft or sensitive bristled brush.If possible use an electric toothbrush instead of a manual toothbrush. The fast action of an electric toothbrush can actually remove twice as much plaque as manual brushing. Look for a sonic electric toothbrush \u2014 the head movement offers the correct movements of the brushing technique and they are more gentle on your teeth.Toothbrushes also come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Choose the shape and size that fits best into your mouth and feels comfortable when brushing. The best brush is one that allows you to reach to the very back of your last molar without difficulty., The American Dental Association (ADA) has a seal of acceptance that can be found on dental products that meet their rigorous standards. When selecting a toothpaste, ensure it has the ADA seal of acceptance on the label. Among other things, the ADA seal of acceptance ensures the toothpaste contains the proper amount of fluoride for certain age groups.If you do not live in North America, check to see if a national or regional dental organization reviews and provides seals of approval for dental products in your area. Then look for that specific seal on the toothpaste you buy.\n Brushing your teeth with the proper technique will help ensure removal of the most amount of plaque possible. The back-and-forth technique you see in movies and on TV will actually harm your enamel. The best brushing technique to use is as follows:Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums.\nMove your toothbrush back and forth in short, gentle strokes. Brush each tooth surface 15 times and make sure you count them without applying too much force.\nThe best way to clean the chewing surface of the molars (where is the highest risk of decay), is to apply a circular clockwise and anti clockwise movement so bacteria can be eliminated by the centrifugal force.\nClean the back of your front teeth by placing the brush vertically against the back of your teeth and making up and down strokes with the brush.\nDon\u2019t forget to use your toothbrush to brush the surface of your tongue as well.\n Each time you brush your teeth, you should brush continuously for two minutes. Split the time between all areas of your mouth to ensure they all get equal treatment. Use a timer or stopwatch to ensure you don\u2019t stop early., Always rinse off your toothbrush when you\u2019re done brushing and make sure there\u2019s no toothpaste residue left on the brush. Store your toothbrush in a cup or toothbrush holder so that the brush is standing upwards.If you\u2019re away on vacation or a business trip, try to store your toothbrush in the same fashion in your hotel (or wherever you\u2019re staying). It\u2019s not a good idea to keep a toothbrush cooped up inside a toothbrush holder longer than absolutely necessary.\n At the very least you should replace your toothbrush, or electric toothbrush head, every three to four months. If the toothbrush looks like it\u2019s damaged or worn, replace it sooner than three months., An awesome oral hygiene routine includes flossing your teeth once a day. Dentist\u2019s recommend you floss in the evening, before bed, as this will help to remove any food residue before it has a chance to sit on or between your teeth all night.While most people tend to floss after they\u2019ve brushed, it is actually recommended that you try flossing before you brush. This helps to remove food particles stuck between your teeth and gums and then allows those areas of your mouth to be cleaned more effectively when you brush., When pulling off a strand of floss from the roll, take about 18 in or 46 cm. Roll one end of the floss around the middle finger on your right hand, and roll the other end of the floss around the middle finger of your left hand. Leave enough floss between your middle fingers so you\u2019re able to grab the floss using your thumbs and index fingers on both hands., While you want to hold the floss between your hands tightly, you want to be as gentle as possible when you\u2019re actually flossing. The floss should be used to rub your tooth up and down while it\u2019s in-between two teeth. You should also attempt to curve the floss around the tooth for better results.As you move through your mouth, unwind one end of the floss and wind the opposite end, so you have fresh floss every one to two teeth.\n There are several alternative tools that can be used in place of floss, if you find it difficult to use floss. Floss picks have floss mounted between two ends so you don\u2019t have to wind and unwind floss yourself. They also have an easy-to-grip handle to manipulate the pick between your teeth. There are also electric flossing machines that spray a jet of water that can be used to clean between your tooth (sometimes referred to as a WaterPik)., Consider using an antimicrobial mouth rinse or a fluoride-based mouthwash everyday. You can use the rinse/wash each time you brush, but you can also use it between brushing to keep your mouth fresh.If you don\u2019t like the idea of bringing a toothbrush and toothpaste to school or work with you, you can always bring a small jar of rinse/wash instead to use after a meal.\n Chewing sugar-free gum throughout the day, specifically after a meal, can help protect your teeth. Chewing gum generates more saliva in your mouth, which in turn can balance the level of acidity. Plus, chewing gum can clean the plaque off your teeth, which will help prevent decay and erosion.Look for sugar-free gum that contains xylitol, as it helps maintain an neutral Ph balance in your mouth.\nNote that some people with jaw issues (such as TMJ) may be advised not to chew gum as it will cause more problems than it will solve. If you have been diagnosed with a jaw issue, ask your dentist if you should be chewing gum.\n Sugar can be very hard on teeth. Sugar can cause or worsen tooth decay, which in turn can lead to cavities. Reducing the amount of sugary food and drinks you consume will help keep your teeth healthy in the long-term.Keep in mind that this includes the sugar you put into items such as coffee, tea, lemonade, iced tea, and other drink mixes.\n Foods and drinks that have a high acidic value can also have a damaging effect on your teeth by eroding the enamel. Enamel protects protects the dentin, which contains the pulp with the nerves and blood vessels of your teeth. Without enamel you\u2019ll find yourself becoming very sensitive to hot and cold foods and drinks and you\u2019ll also likely experience pain. Reducing or eliminating acidic foods and drinks will help to protect your enamel and keep your teeth healthy and strong.If you are drinking an acidic beverage, try drinking it with a straw. This methods help prevent the drink \u2014 and therefore the acid \u2014 from actually touching your teeth.\n Smoking is terrible on your mouth. In addition to giving you bad breath and stained teeth, smoking can also increase your chances of losing your teeth and getting mouth cancer. If you currently smoke, seriously consider quitting. If you do not smoke, don\u2019t start. Quitting smoking can also have positive benefits on your overall health and wellbeing, not to mention your pocketbook., There are several things you may do on a regular basis that have become habits, but are actually quite bad for your teeth and mouth. Reducing the amount of time you use the habit, or eliminating it altogether, will significantly help keep your mouth healthy and strong. The following bad habits should be avoided:Biting your nails.\nBrushing too hard or with a hard-bristled toothbrush. Massage, don\u2019t scrub, your teeth when you brush.\nGrinding or clenching your teeth. If you happen to do this while you sleep, ask your dentist about a mouthguard.\nChewing ice cubes.\nUsing your teeth as tools! This includes using your teeth to rip tape or open a plastic package. Use scissors instead.\n Ideally you should have a professional cleaning and dental exam at least once a year, however some dentists (and insurance plans) may suggest as often as every six months. A professional cleaning will allow a dentist or dental hygienist to scrape off all the built-up plaque and tartar on your teeth that you are not able to remove with brushing or flossing. X-rays are often taken at annual dental exams in order to allow the dentist to determine if you have any cavities or other issues., If you find yourself experiencing any of the following problems, make an appointment to see your dentist right away. Many of these issues are symptoms for much more serious dental problems which, if caught early, may be simple to fix. If your dentist is already aware of these issues from an annual exam, follow their instructions as to how to handle the problem.Very red, swollen and tender gums.\nGums that bleed a lot when you brush or floss.\nGums that appear to be pulling away from your teeth (it looks like your teeth are getting bigger).\nGums that seem to grow bigger and wider, slowly covering the surface of your teeth.\nLoose teeth (other than baby teeth).\nChanges in your bite \u2014 the way your top and bottom teeth align.\nVery high sensitivity to heat or cold.\nConstant bad breath or bad taste in your mouth.\n Fluoride can help prevent tooth decay and, therefore, cavities. Fluoride is normally found in toothpastes and mouthwashes, but can also be applied as a varnish or treatment at your dentist\u2019s office. Annual fluoride treatments are normally recommended for children and teenagers, but adults can also benefit.Many cities throughout North America add fluoride to their drinking water, which is for your teeth. Check with your city to determine if fluoride is added to the water where you live.\n\n"}

Let's say we're converting the common fraction 1/3 to a decimal. Just set it up with the 3, or the denominator, outside the division bracket, and the 1 inside the division bracket.\n Since your answer will be less than one, this will help you put the answer in decimal form. You should also place a decimal point after the \"1\" inside the division bracket.\n Now, to do long division, you'll begin by making the \"1.\" into a \"1.0\" so you can divide \"3\" into what you can think of as the number \"10.\" Here's where you go from there:\n\n\nSimply divide 10 by 3. You'll get 3 x 3, or 9, with a remainder of 1. So, write a 3 after the \"0.\" above the division bracket, and subtract the answer, 9, from 10 to get a remainder of 1.\nAdd another \"0\" after the \"1\" below the \"10\" to get \"10\" again. When you divide \"3\" into \"10\" again, you'll have to repeat the process, placing another \"3\" after the first \"3\" above the division bracket along with subtracting another \"9\" from the new \"10\" you have left.\nKeep going until you notice a pattern. Notice something funny yet? You'll see that this can go on forever. You can keep dividing 3 into 10, getting a remainder of 1, and writing yet another \"3\" after the decimal point above the division bracket.\n Now that you see that the \"3\" can repeat forever, simply write your answer as \".3\" with a bar over the \"3\" to indicate that it will repeat forever, or as \".33\" with the same bar over both numbers. This is 1/3 in decimal form because you'll never be able to get a perfect, clean decimal out of it.\n\n\nThere are many fractions that have repeating decimals, such as 2/9 (\".2\" repeating), 5/6 (\".83\" with the \"3\" repeating), or 7/9 (\".7\" repeating). This will happen any time you have a denominator that is a multiple of 3 with a numerator that won't go into it cleanly.\n\n"}

Both methods have advantages and drawbacks, so you'll need to weigh up what works best for you. For example, a paper based journal can be taken anywhere, never needs electricity, and can be highly personalized with drawings, collages, theater-tickets and mementos. It also can give you more \"pressure\" to edit your feelings. However, typing can be faster and easier in the electronic format, and an electronic document can still be personalized in different ways. Both journal types can be found if measures aren't taken to hide them well, but it's probably easier to hide an electronic file than a paper book.\n\n\nWhile there is no need to get a fancy journal, for some people the stationery used is a large part of the sensory experience of keeping a journal. You don't have to buy expensive or fancy versions but if they are something you really want and they're a treat to yourself, then work it into your budget.\nDecorating possibilities are endless for cheaper journals and it's fun to personalize a journal rather than rely on someone else's idea of good design. Just keep in mind that it's not about using a fancy book; it's about tapping into the stream of thoughts and writing them down.\nDecide on your writing implement if using paper. Choose a pen that feels good to you and works for your own aesthetic needs.\n There are different possibilities open to you when developing your journal theme or approach. You could simply use your journal to write down all the thoughts that come to you at any particular time, randomly, or you could make your journal more focused on a specific theme to draw out something that you're trying to develop more of in your life. And there is nothing saying that you can't keep both a random and a specific journal at the same time! Some ideas for themed journals include:\n\n\nA gratitude journal \u2013 in this journal you record all the things for which you feel grateful each day, week, etc. and note the people, animals, events, and things that really matter to you.\nA vacation journal \u2013 in this journal you record more than just what you see on your vacation; you also record your feelings, impressions, and emotions as they are challenged, changed, and illuminated by your travels.\nAn ideas journal \u2013 in this journal you record all the ideas and inspirations that flash into your mind at any time without warning, providing a place that you can come back to as an idea-storming resource when you have the time. The ideas can be for writing, for business, for play, for inventions, for anything at all!\nA child raising journal \u2013 in this journal you record all the things that you think are special, wonderful, lovable, and memorable about your kids at different ages and stages. This is a great way to keep a record of those funny words, phrases, and comments made by kids as they grow up and see the world anew.\nA transition journal \u2013 in this journal you record the transition you're going through, such as job hunting or loss, becoming a parent for the first time or again after many years, starting a business, going on a special journey, etc. This type of journal can document changing patterns in your life, and it is useful to ask yourself such questions as \"What do I enjoy and not enjoy?\", \"What do I expect for the future in what I am doing now?\", \"Which people can help me as I transition?\", etc.\n Journal writing is a time of reflection and requires solitude, peace, and no interruptions. It's important to feel relaxed, at ease, and not worried about someone else barging in on your reflection time. It's also important to feel comfortable. Select your favorite journal writing spot or spots keeping in mind all of these essential needs and experiment by writing in different places to see what happens to the content of your writing.\n\n\nTake a seat in your chair by the glowing fire or lie down underneath a blossoming apple tree.\nFind a quiet part of the house where you know you won't be disturbed.\nThe suitability of a place can change with the time of day. Keep this in mind when selecting your writing nook; for example, the kitchen might be hubbub and bustle all day long but come 10pm, it might be the quietest and most enjoyable part of the house.\n Some of the advice on journal-writing tries to turn it into an effort by suggesting that you should commit to daily writing, or to some form of regular writing. This misses the point in keeping a journal, which is that it is an extension of you and how you're feeling. And if you don't feel like writing in your journal even though you made some commitment to yourself to write in it, it's possibly going to turn into something that you resent. Better than making a commitment to regular writing is to make a commitment to yourself that when you feel like using your journal to be creative, to vent feelings, to write down ideas, etc., then you will. And if that's daily, then good for you; if it skips a month or two or even a year here and there, then so be it. Many journal writers have journals spanning years with gaps of entire years between and pick them up again from where they last left off whenever they need the journal.\n\n\nKeeping your journal by your bedside can be helpful if you find yourself forgetting to write in it. Often thoughts come before sleeping time and writing in a journal can be a helpful way to wind down at the day's end, provided it's a comfortable place for you.\nRemind yourself whenever you feel down, antsy, brimful of ideas, etc., that your journal is the perfect outlet.\n Every person differs in what helps them to relax and feel contented, and it is no different when getting in the mood for journal writing. Some people enjoy having music to get them in the mood, others need total quiet, while others need the constant drone of city life to stimulate thinking. Choose whatever methods aid your escape into journal writing and doesn't make it feel like too much effort.\n\n\nDon't fuss about grammar, spelling, or other perfection in your journal. This is your place, and if there are boo boos, then so be it. Wanting to erase errors while working through deep issues of feelings or having a wellspring of ideas can hamper your flow and also tends to suggest that you're trying too hard to control the situation you're writing about rather than to learn more about it and to find new ways to perceive it.\n It's often easiest to start with your current feelings. Transfer them to paper and see where this takes you next. There are no rules at all about journal writing and you may find that your starting points vary every time you begin a new entry. Sometimes it is easier to begin with a narrative about something that happened to you during the day, something that is burning right through you and that you want answers to but feel confused about. Writing down the mundane facts and events can open up a whole stream of consciousness as you're writing, leading you to insights you would not have been able to bring forth without arranging your thoughts in the journal. Other spurs to writing can include:\n\n\nTry movies, books, or TV shows as a starting point sometimes: for example, you can consider the philosophical implications of your favorite movie, or write an essay about why you find this or that character compelling... or not.\nPretend you have an audience and you are the professor; give a lecture in what you want them to hear. Sometimes writing down events in your life that have taken place or writing down questions and answering them can waken the creative juices simmering in your mind.\nDiscuss something you bought or made during the past few days. Is it something that you're going to use for a new hobby, to help you complete an essay, to woo a person with, to decorate your home, etc.? Take the reason for buying or making it and proceed to write about the motivations behind it.\n Journals come top of the list when venting your troubles; many therapists rubber-stamp the journal as a key part of recovery from emotional distresses that patients are seeking to work through. A journal soaks up your anger, your rage, your vengeance, your jealousy, your whole plethora of negative emotions and doesn't judge you, doesn't shout back at you, doesn't curse you, and doesn't tell you to get a life. It sits there passive in one way but very revealing in another. Getting negative feelings off your chest and into a journal can liberate you from having to vent the feelings anywhere else, and can give you the necessary breathing space to try to see the facts beneath the emotions and to stand in the shoes of others involved in your feelings to see whether or not they have a point.\n\n\nFeel free to curse, to call people names, and to let it all out. It's better here than anywhere else and it is a way of giving vent to frustration, anger, and attitude that needs an outlet somewhere safe.\nKeep writing until you feel spent. This gives you the best chance of freeing yourself from the feelings that are haunting you and preventing you from moving on to more positive feelings.\nWrite about the guy you never think you'll get to date, write about the girl next door who keeps telling secrets about you, write about your parents or parents-in-law, or your family in general, write about your ambitions, your callings, your skills, your favorites; the list can go on and on.\n Of course, doodles are totally acceptable. Lyrics to songs, poems, book excerpts and newspaper clippings are also encouraged. It's sometimes fun to glue in little tidbits of your life, like the ticket stubs from a movie or play you saw on Friday night or the picture you took of a breathtaking sunset. The journal is the real-life manifestation of your mind, so make it something that's completely yours!\n\n, It's not all write and no read; comparing where you are now with where your were several weeks, months, and years ago is a beneficial exercise in growth. Think about what things have become clearer to you from one journal entry to the next, and think about what hopes and dreams once written in your journal have now turned into reality. Think about the things that are yet to still happen and whether there are signs or patterns you can discern that are somehow blocking your intended progress. Use your journal to assess your life's journey.\n No one will see this journal but you have to make sure of that too. You'll only feel free to truly express yourself if the journal cannot compromise your relationships with others or how you're viewed, so be sure to find safe places to keep the journal.\n\n\nFind perfect hiding places for your journal. Vary them regularly if you have concerns about anybody prying. Be clever about the cover too; perhaps make it appear like a chemistry textbook or accounting principles to throw off snooping siblings or spouses.\nLearn how to lock access to electronic documents. If you're keeping your journal in electronic form, password protect your computer and your document. Be careful of cloud computing just in case some slip-up happens.\nWrite a simple beginning note for any prying eyes, just in case. Write something along the lines of \"Before you feel compelled to read my deepest thoughts, consider how you would feel if somebody did the same thoughtless and uncaring act to you. The karma be with you.\"\nRead How to hide your diary for some more ideas.\n\n"}

Any acne that can be aggravated during different times of the menstrual cycle can be called hormonal acne.In the first half of the menstrual cycle, the prominent reproductive hormone is estrogen, and in the second half, the prominent hormone is progesterone, which stimulates the production of sebum. Additionally, the relative levels of testosterone increase, which stimulates even more sebum production.\nIn some young girls and women, the balance between these hormones is such that acne can flare up in those days before the period begins. In some, that balance can signal significant problems with the reproductive system while others will re-balance without using any hormonal treatment., Hormonal acne has a specific pattern so that you know when it\u2019s going to pop up. This breakout usually occurs around the time of the menstrual cycle. Hormonal acne usually appears under the cheekbones and around the chin and mouth.Hormonal acne is generally painful, large, with pockets of pus. It\u2019s usually resistant to any type of treatment.\n It is not always clear why acne occurs. Hormonal acne can be caused by an underlying condition, such as Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). A few common reasons for acne include reactions or sensitivities to chemicals in cosmetics or personal products, smoking, or sensitivity to dairy products and highly processed and sugary foods. It may also be due to inflammation from an underlying condition or bacterial infections.High levels or excess activity of the male hormone testosterone can cause acne. This can occur during the second half of the menstrual cycle. It is not necessarily a problem of too much testosterone; it may just be a matter of too much testosterone as compared to the levels of estrogen and progesterone.\nReduced fatty acid levels in the skin due to not enough essential fatty acids in the diet may also cause acne.\nAcne commonly occurs in both male and female teens and young adults, but more women in their 30s, 40s, and 50s are getting acne\n\n"}

{"title": "How to Play Fantasy Hockey1", "summary": "research the types of fantasy hockey.\nresearch the types of leagues.\nlearn about the categories.\nlook into the types of drafts.", "article": " As with the majority of fantasy sports, fantasy hockey is presented in several different forms:\n\n\nIn rotisserie fantasy hockey, stat categories award points based on the number of teams in the league (for example, in a 10-team league, categories award points from 1 to 10 depending on where teams rank in that category). If you rank fifth in assists, that would be worth 6 points to your team. The owner with the highest point total at the end of the season is declared the winner.\n\nPoints-based is the simplest style of fantasy hockey, awarding different point totals for various achievements (goals, penalty minutes, goalie wins, and others). The team that collects the most points wins.\n\nHead-to-head pits one team owner against another on a weekly basis. Their rosters compete against one another in various statistical categories, with each team earning a \u201cwin\u201d for finishing ahead of the opponent in a category. Rather than accumulate points, team owners aim to finish with the best \u201cwin-loss record\u201d at season\u2019s end.\n\nSalary-based is a fantasy game in which owners are given a fixed amount of fictional money and must use it to build a team. Each player in the NHL is tagged with a predetermined \u201csalary.\u201d Users are not allowed to exceed the \u201csalary cap.\u201d;\n, It is important to establish how much commitment you\u2019re willing to put into playing fantasy hockey before deciding on what kind of league you\u2019re interested in entering:\n\n\n\nSingle-year leagues are the simplest form of fantasy hockey. You draft a team, make roster moves throughout the season and go for the championship. The following year, you start completely from scratch. This style of league is ideal for anyone looking for something easy to track and requiring the minimum amount of commitment.\n\nKeeper leagues allow fantasy players to keep a maximum number of NHL players on their roster from one season to the next. Some leagues mandate that each team keep the same number of players, while others set a range of players per team. The following year\u2019s draft includes any player not retained.\nIn dynasty leagues, teams remain the same from year to year, with the only roster changes coming in the form of player adds, player drops and trades. Each year, the annual draft consists exclusively of rookies. This league requires a great deal of attention and commitment.\n While each league varies, most use some variation of 10 categories\u2014six devoted to forwards and defenseman and four geared toward goaltenders:\n\n\n\nGoals refer to any instance in which a player directs the puck into the net.\n\nAssists are given to a maximum of 2 players who touch the puck prior to a teammate scoring a goal. Possession must be uninterrupted for an assist to be awarded.\n\nPower play points are rewarded any time a player records a goal or an assist while his team has a man advantage.\n\nShorthanded points refer to any goals or assists accumulated while a player\u2019s team is short a man.\n\nPenalty minutes are accumulated whenever a player is given an infraction.\n\nPlus-minus is a category that tracks which players are on the ice for goals in even-man situations (5-on-5, 4-on-4, or 3-on-3). A player on the ice when his team scores an even-man goal is given a plus-1, while opposing players are given a minus-1.\n\nGoalie wins are awarded whenever a netminder is on the ice when his team scores the eventual winning goal.\n\nGoals-against average is a stat tracking how many goals the netminder allows per 60 minutes of action.\n\nSave percentage measures a goaltender\u2019s success rate when it comes to stopping the puck; a perfect save percentage is 1.000.\n\nShutouts refer to any game in which a goaltender does not allow a goal.\n The type of draft you conduct will shape how you conduct your research and ultimately decide on a strategy:\n\n\n\nStraight drafts can be conducted either online or in person. In a straight draft, the order is established, and users select NHL players one at a time. The order can either be regular (people own the same pick in every round) or serpentine (straight draft order is used for odd-numbered rounds, while the opposite is used for even-numbered rounds). Players are selected until all teams\u2019 empty slots are filled.\n\nAuto drafts are conducted online, with teams selected automatically rather than by the competing team owners. The drafting program makes selections based either by the site\u2019s player rankings, or by pre-rankings established by the team owner. This type of draft is ideal for those who are unable to agree on a mutual date for a live draft.\n\nAuction drafts do not follow a specific draft order. Instead, a player is offered up for bid by one team owner, and everyone then bids on the player until a final price is established. Teams are limited to predetermined budgets and must fill every spot on their roster without running out of money.\n\n"}

You can also train on goblins until you reach level 25.\n About 500 to 1,000 iron or bronze arrows is enough.\n\nPlease note that if you have the financial means, you may now purchase a Willow Composite Bow, however, the slight increase in ranged attack does not sufficiently offset the noticeable decrease in ranged speed.\ntest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Take full advantage of the tables in each location to hide behind while ranging. Range until level 40.\n Minotaurs are levels 12&27 and they drop iron arrows and minotaurs drop bronze full helms also which you can sell to Peksa the barbarian helmet salesman), Maple Short Bow, and Green Dragonhide Armour (D\u2019hide Chaps, D\u2019hide Vambraces, Coif and D\u2019hide Body if you have completed Dragon Slayer Quest). Then fight White Knights in Falador until range level 60.\n Taking advantage of the rocks, hide and range Lesser Demons or go to the third story of the wizards tower and range the lesser demons. Range until reaching level 99. See the Tips below for what arrows to use at these high levels.\n An alternative switch is chickens,which are one of the best to level 15, but you would probably get bored after level 15. The cowhides sell for over 100gp each, and the bones provide fairly good prayer experience for your current level. Just bank at Beefy bill's every time you get a full inventory of cowhides. Another alternative to the cowhides are bringing them to Al Kharid's tanner and making hard leather. This is a longer more boring process, but very profitable and easy to obtain.;\n, They drop a wide variety of very good herbs, up to torstol, which sells around 10-20k each. You won't be damaged too much if you aren't too low of a level, but if you are low-leveled, bring some food. Tuna is a good and cheap delicacy to bring. Dwarves are also an option, but only work well until level 30. And they do not drop as much of profitable items as Chaos Druids do.\n You need a brass key, which is very easy to obtain. Just ask someone to get one for you in the dungeon if you do not own one. Hill giants drop limpwurt roots very often, sell for 1k gp a piece, and their big bones give good prayer exp. Or if you are not into leveling your prayer you can sell the bones for good gold. You can make a lot of money per trip. Another option is training on white knights until level 50,though they can work until 60, it is not recommended to train on them till level 60, because they do get boring and do not drop good items.\n They drop big bones every time and also drop good seeds occasionally. They are also a reliable charm dropper. As long as you avoid melee distance, you won't take too much damage. Though they don't hit that high, only around 6 or 7 damage.\n These are very good moneymakers, but you will need a rune c'bow + anti-dragon shield equipped plus quite some food and mithril bolts at the very least. Once you are at 65+, train on blue dragons as well so you don't get bored. Plus, they have rare drops more frequently than green dragons, and their hides are worth more. But watch out, though there are safe spots, you still have to run out and grab your loot so be careful, because they are over level 100. Also, you might also want to interfere range with your slayer tasks now. Another option is werewolves, which are good with iron knives or steel darts, and the wolf bones, which are dropped 100% of the time, can be alched or sold in the Grand Exchange for a good profit, or they can be used in summoning.\n You can spend some fun time and kill metal dragons in hope for a visage, but this is not very good exp. Aviansies are a good strategy. They're VERY profitable dropping adamant bars much of the time and are simple to kill with your current range level. Since the Aviansies are in the God Wars dungeon, you might want to bring a piece of Armadyl equipment in order to avoid other monsters from attacking you. The cheapest item to bring is an Armadyl Pendant acquired after the Temple of Ikov quest. Depending on your defense, decide on whether or not you need prayer potions (especially if you are pure range). Fire giants also work pretty well. They have decent drops and can't hit too high if you are good enough to avoid damage if you have low defence. The hill giants in Taverley Dungeon are great exp, too, and can be excellent experience until the mid-90s, since nearly nobody trains there. They have decent hitpoints, low defence, don't hit commonly, and if you use knives/magic shortbow with Ava's attractor, and a full dragonhide set with maybe Ranger boots and a Robin Hood Hat, you can achieve excellent experience in what is basically no time at all. The Tzhaar are also a very profitable enemy to train on since they drop Obsidian Charms and Obsidian weapons, cape, shield, etc. There are a few safe spots in the caves, too, so you don't have to worry about damage.\n You can range almost anything perfectly. You can continue with Aviansies, which will give you a ton of money. Or, you could battle with the other monsters stated earlier in the article. During this stage, you will make a TON of profit if you choose the correct methods. Red chinchompas are likely the best experience, which equal to around 300k exp per hour, but cost amazingly high, too.\n\n"}

{"title": "How to Use a Drill Safely2", "summary": "drill a pilot hole.\ndrill with steady pressure.\nadjust the clutch.\navoid overheating the drill bit.\ndo not force a jammed bit through.", "article": " In many cases, you'll get better results if you start with a drill bit a little smaller than the final hole size. Drill a shallow \"pilot hole,\" then switch to the larger bit to finish the job. The pilot hole will help prevent your drill bit from slipping, and reduces the chance of splitting wood or other damage.Very brittle materials such as ceramic and glass require extra care. Make a small \"X\" in masking tape where you want the hole, to help prevent slipping and chipping. Instead of drilling the pilot hole, place the drill bit over the X, then gently tap it with a hammer to create a small dent.\n Hold the drill steady and push it into the material you're drilling. If it takes more than light force to drill the hole, you're probably using the wrong bit., Each drill has a twistable collar to adjust the torque, often with a series of numbers on it. The higher the number, the more torque (rotational force) the drill will apply. If you are having trouble penetrating the material, increase the torque. If you are over-driving screws (burying them too deep), or if drilling too deep could damage something, lower the torque.\n\n\nSome models mark the highest torque with a drill bit icon., If you are drilling through hard materials or drilling at high speeds, the drill bit will encounter an immense amount of friction. This can rapidly overheat the bit, to the point where it becomes red hot or burns the material you're drilling. Start at low drill speeds, and only increase the speed if the drill isn't moving smoothly. If you're drilling through hard materials, or drilling many holes in any material, stick to slow speeds and pause occasionally to give the bit a few seconds to cool down.\n\n\nWhen drilling glass, ceramic, or stone, give the bit a steady supply of water to keep it cool. One way to do this is to build a \"dam\" out of putty or modeling clay around your drilling area. Fill the area with water so it flows down into the hole. \"Pump\" the bit up and down so the water can reach the tip.Even if the drill bit doesn't look hot, give it time to cool down before touching it.\n If the drill bit gets stuck in the material, don't try to force it out by running the drill. Unplug the drill, separate the bit and the chuck, and remove the bit using manual tools."}

This will help break down and remove small particles of grease., If you want to prevent grease stains, do not cook near your tea kettle. If you're using your stove, remove your tea kettle beforehand. Set it aside while you're cooking to prevent it from becoming damaged by grease.\n\n"}

Use whatever\u2019s on hand, such as old jeans and t-shirts.;\n, Wanna be a zombie princess or ballerina who\u2019s been zombified? Go for a cute identity that\u2019s gone terribly, terribly wrong.This might be where last year\u2019s costume comes in handy. If you have an old ballerina tutu or princess costume hanging around, you could zombify it so long as you don\u2019t mind destroying it in the process.\n Have a significant other who also likes zombies? Be a zombie pair, such as a zombie bride and groom or maybe a famous couple from history who\u2019ve come back from the dead.Hit up a used clothing store to look for wedding apparel.\n Have a favorite superhero? Nursery rhyme character? Disney character? Choose a character and turn them into a zombie!\n\nMake sure you\u2019ve got a costume on hand that\u2019ll identify you as your character. You could always do something recognizable, such as Little Red Riding Hood, that has a simple costume., Zombies don\u2019t wear brand new clothes, so you\u2019ve got to make your clothing look old to be authentic. Use a spritz bottle filled with water and a few drops of brown or black food coloring or black tea to make your clothes look old.Spritz your clothing unevenly to make it look more realistically aged.\n Zombies stumble around catching themselves on things, so to make it realistic tear up those clothes. Add some tears into your clothing with a seam ripper or knife. Don\u2019t be afraid to also use your hands to tear at some small cuts.To make your tears look realistic, cut in random areas and vary the size of the cuts and the amount of fraying.\nRemember that your clothing will need to stay on your body, so don\u2019t get too carried away with the ripping and tearing!\n\n, Take your clothes outside and rub them around in the dirt and mud to get that grimy zombie look down for your clothing.

Use store bought blood or make your own, and then spatter it all over your clothing using your own hands and sponges.\n\n\nMake sure to step away from your clothing to see how it looks at a distance.An easy do-it-yourself recipe for fake blood is combining corn syrup with a few drops of red food coloring. Then add a squirt of chocolate syrup to thicken and darken the blood., Using extreme caution, take a lighter to your clothing to singe or burn parts of it to achieve that zombified look.You should always do this in an open area away from flammable surfaces and have a fire extinguisher nearby.\n Apply liquid latex on your face in a light layer using a sponge, and then stretch your skin tight while drying the liquid latex with a hairdryer. This\u2019ll be sure to make your face look old and tired.Do this before you put on your face makeup so when you apply makeup the wrinkles will appear deeper.\nIf you\u2019ve got a latex allergy, you can easily make your own liquid latex substitute. Mix together 1 cup (236.59 mL) cold water, \u00bc cup (59.15 mL) tapioca flour, 1 packet plain gelatin, and 1 tablespoon (14.79 mL) of solid coconut oil., Make sure your face is pale by blotchily applying a very pale nude makeup to your face. You won\u2019t want your natural skin tones to give you away as alive!Don\u2019t make your face blue or green since zombies are always very earth toned., Zombies shouldn\u2019t have pink tongues, so mix a drop of black food coloring in with your mouthwash and swill it around in your mouth. This\u2019ll give you the perfect dead looking tongue and mouth., Make your eyes appear sunken in by adding a dark purplish-brown makeup color around your eye socket and along your upper and lower lids.\n\n\nGo darker along the lids by adding a black eyeliner pencil on top of your purplish-brown color., Colored contacts are a great way to mute the life from your eyes. Try a pair in red, green, or another dark color.Colored contacts should only be used with a prescription, even for non-corrective lenses. You can get them by visiting your local eye doctor and getting a prescription., Mix up some liquid latex and cotton, tissue paper, or toilet paper in a bowl and then apply to your face or arm. Allow the mixture to dry halfway and then begin to pull pieces away. Sponge on some dark earth tone colors and then add blood into the mix.\n\nIf your liquid latex wound is going to cover any hair, add a layer of petroleum jelly first.When you\u2019re done being a zombie you can just peel off the liquid latex to remove it., Use a Q-tip to apply some blood smears to your body and face.You can make the blood drippy or smeared.\nGo ahead and give yourself a bloody nose!, Don\u2019t forget to make your hair look disgusting to complete your zombie look. Tease it out with a brush and tangle it all up. Use hairspray to make sure your teased hair stays in place. Put conditioner in it while dry to make it look greasy and gross.You can find colored hairsprays if you want to add some darker black or brown tones into your lighter hair. You can purchase these at any local pharmacy.\nGet creative and incorporate leaves or twigs into your matted hair.\nIf you don't want your hair to be ruined or deal with combing it out later, get a cheap wig that you can destroy.\n\n"}

You can use your fingers to gently ease clumps away. Pat your plant dry with a paper towel.\n Do not wait for it to lose its moisture. Place it on a scale. The scale should be able to read measurements as small as milligrams. Record the weight., Return it to its hole, and cover with fresh soil. If you are potting your plants, place some potting soil in the bottom of a pot before putting the plant back in. Cover with fresh potting soil, leaving an inch between the soil and the lip of the pot.Water the plant to replace any lost moisture.\n You should not weigh your plants often as this can harm the plant by slowing its growth or killing it. As long as you are gentle and do not touch its roots, you may be able to safely remove and weigh the plant a few times, but exercise extreme caution when doing so.\n After you have a second measurement, use the growth rate formula to calculate the daily average growth rate.

Rubbing alcohol is very effective at dissolving some types of adhesive. Apply a small amount with a Q-tip or cotton ball, let it sit briefly, and rub gently to remove.\n\n\nRubbing alcohol can dry out and irritate skin, especially in delicate areas like the face. Use only a few drops at a time and allow your skin to rest between uses.\n The active ingredient in most nail polish removers is acetone, a chemical solvent. Acetone also works as a solvent for many common glues and adhesives, dissolving them on contact.Rub a small amount into the affected area and let it sit for a few moments, then continue rubbing gently to remove.\n\n\nAcetone can have a similar drying or irritating effect on the skin as rubbing alcohol, so take similar precautions.\nIf you can find it, pure acetone works just as well as nail polish remover.\nExercise care in using acetone; it is a highly flammable substance and thus should not be used in combination with heat.Avoid using non-acetone nail polish removers as they will not contain the solvent required to dissolve the bandage residue.\n Products like Vaseline made out of petroleum jelly work like oils and lotions to remove adhesive from the skin. A unique benefit is that petroleum jelly is extra-thick, so it's easy to let it sit for a long time (though its greasiness makes this unpleasant for some). Simply work a thin layer into the affected skin and let it sit undisturbed for five to ten minutes, then wipe off with a gentle rag or paper towels.\n Adhesive removers are generally manufactured either as sprays or disposable wipes. They are a little more expensive and harder to find than the methods above, but they work especially well.\n\n\nYou may be able to find these products at your local pharmacy. If not, a wide variety are available for order online. Prices vary from product to product but typically range between $10\u2013$25 per bottle or package., Many chemical products (especially rubbing alcohol, acetone, and some adhesive removers) can irritate the skin if they are in contact with it for too long. To avoid this, make sure to wash the area with soap and water after each use of these chemicals. This will help remove them from the skin and reduce irritation.\n\n\nIf you aren't able to get all of the adhesive off your skin at once, consider waiting a day before you repeat use of a harsh chemical again. The break will give your skin a chance to rest and recover. Alternatively, combine a chemical treatment with one of the gentler solutions.\n\n"}

Dispose of the peelings and place the potatoes in a large pot., Fill the pot of potatoes up with cold water until the water covers the potatoes by about one inch (2.54 cm). Then turn the heat to medium high., Cook the potatoes over medium heat until they reach a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low., Cook the potatoes for about 6-7 minutes, then poke one of the potatoes with a fork. If the fork can pierce the potato fairly easily but still meets resistance in the middle of the potato, the potatoes are done parboiling. If the potato is still difficult to pierce, cook until they are done.This process of cooking the potatoes before frying or baking is called parboiling. Partially cooking the potatoes ensures that they will be light and crispy when fried or baked instead of dense or mushy.\n Once parboiled, pour the potatoes into a colander to let the water drain away. Pat the potatoes with a paper towel, then place them on the counter to cool., Once cooled, finely shred the potatoes. You can use the food processor, making sure to use the grating attachment, or use a box grater to grate the potatoes by hand.\n\n\nHow finely you shred the potatoes is up to you. Traditionally, tater tots are finely shred, but if you want more textured tots you can either grate them for less time in the food processor or use a coarse box grater to grate the potatoes., Place the grated potato pulp in a large piece of cheesecloth or inside several paper towels and bring up the corners to make a sack. Use your hands to squeeze the sack of potatoes to drain them until liquid stops dripping out.Potatoes naturally retain a lot of water. Draining the shredded potato will help your tots get crispy.\n Once drained, transfer the shredded potato out of the cheesecloth or paper towel to a large mixing bowl. Add in the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, dill and salt and pepper. Then mix with a large spoon until all the ingredients make an even paste.If you want neutral tasting tots, leave off the garlic powder, onion powder and dill. If you want your tots to have a slight edge, use the garlic powder and salt and pepper but the other flavorings.\n Scoop the mixture out onto a clean cutting board or counter. Pick up small scoops of the mixture and use your hands to shape it into cylindrical tots that are a little shorter than the length of your thumb., Place a large stockpot on the stove over medium heat.

If the skillet isn\u2019t large enough to fit all the tots, fry them in batches so that the skillet doesn\u2019t get overcrowded.\n After the tots have fried for about 2 minutes, use a spatula to flip the tots over to the other side so that they cook evenly. The tots should be getting golden and start to look crispy., After about 3-4 minutes, the tots should be golden brown and crispy. Use a spatula to scoop the tots up and transfer them to two layers of paper towels to absorb excess oil. If you are baking the tots in batches, fry the rest of the tots., Let the tots sit on the paper towels for about 30 seconds, then serve while hot. Garnish with parsley if you wish and serve alongside ketchup, mayo or your favorite dips., Begin baking your tater tots by preheating the oven to 425 degrees F (218.33 C). If you want extra crispy tots, preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232.22 C)., Cover the baking tray with parchment paper, then place the tots on top. Parchment paper will make cleanup easier than baking the tots directly on top of the baking tray., Drizzle 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) on the tots, then toss them to lightly coat them in the oil.

In the end, you\u2019ll have a tasty and different version of your family\u2019s favorite meal.\n\nBoil your lasagna noodles.\nDecide if you want to cut them up, shred them, or use them as large pieces in your beef stroganoff.\nPlace them into the dish as you would normally place egg noodles., Kugel is a traditional Jewish baked dish, much like a casserole. The great thing about kugel is that you can substitute a wide variety of ingredients for whatever you prefer or whatever you have in your kitchen. To make a lasagna kugel:\n\nSet aside a half pound (8 ounces) of noodles, break them up, boil them, and then strain them.\nCombine the noodles with \u00bd stick of butter, 1 pound (.45 kl) of cottage cheese, \u00bd cup of sugar, 6 eggs, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and \u00bd cup of raises.\nPour into a lubricated baking dish and bake for about 30 to 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown., While you\u2019ve probably made many lasagnas, you have probably never made a chocolate lasagna. By making a chocolate lasagna, you\u2019ll put an interesting and tasty spin on a dish your family is already familiar with. Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees (177 degrees Celsius). Then:\n\nBoil 8 ounces of noodles for 1 minute, strain them, and place them in a bowl of ice water. After they\u2019ve cooled, strain them again and allow them to dry.\nMix 2 pounds of ricotta (.9 kg), 1 cup of sugar, \u00bd cup of unsweetened cocoa, and 2 eggs together.\nAdd 1 or 2 cups of chocolate chips and 4 ounces of grated white chocolate.\nSpread \u00bc of the ricotta onto the bottom of an 8 inch by 8 inch (20 centimeters) baking dish.\nSprinkle your choice of nuts or other topping and then cap the layer with lasagna noodles.\nRepeat the previous process until you have four layers of ricotta. Do not top the final layer with lasagna noodles. Bake for about 35 minutes., While a chocolate lasagna might be yummy, it also takes a bit of work. Fortunately, the fried strawberry crunch is very simple and quick to make. Begin by boiling, straining, and drying the noodles. Then:\n\nCut the noodles into squares, rectangles, or triangles.\nDrop your noodle pieces into 350-degree Fahrenheit vegetable oil (177 degrees Celsius). Take them out when they are golden brown and dust them with powdered sugar.\nCombine 1 cup of white sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 4 cups of strawberries (fresh or frozen), in a medium saucepan and let the combination simmer for 15 or 20 minutes.\nTop your fried noodles with whipped cream, and then spread your strawberry sauce over the chips and whipped cream."}

Start doing this as soon as the first buds appear on the plant.\n\n\nA general water-soluble plant feed or one that your rake into the soil is fine. This encourages the plant to produce flowers. You can purchase plant feed at your local gardening supply store.\n You should make a point to water your tubers just after planting, as mentioned above. Continue to water your new plants once every 10 to 14 days. When the first foliage, or leaves, appear on your plants, you should try to water them once a week.Continue watering your plants once a week until fall comes around. In the fall, the ranunculus will die back, or go dormant, and will not need to be watered. Dormancy is covered more thoroughly in Step 5 of this section.\n Sadly, ranunculus can fall prey to pests like slugs and aphids. Luckily, there are measures you can take to make sure that these pests stay away.\n\n\nCombat slugs with slug pellets, which are sprinkled around your ranunculus. You can purchase these pellets at a garden supply store.\nA standard aphid spray or insecticidal soap should be applied if aphid attack occurs.\n As with many flowering plants, it\u2019s advisable to remove spent flowerheads once they wither (when they dry up and die). This not only makes the plant look tidier, it also encourages other flowers to form and reduces the amount of energy the plant spends on seed formation, which helps preserve its strength.\n\n\nUse a sharp pair of scissors to snip off the dead heads as soon as they begin to look scruffy. Try to cut the flower at the base of the stem, which is located in amongst the foliage, or leaves.\n Once the flowering season ends in fall, allow the foliage to die back. Dying back means that the plant becomes dormant until the next flowering season.To encourage the plant to regrow the next season:\n\n\nRefrain from cutting the dead growth away before the first frost. You don\u2019t need to water the plant while it is dormant; in fact, these plants do better if they are not watered while they are dormant in the winter.\n Ranunculus will tolerate a light frost if left in the ground through a fairly mild winter. If your local climate regularly experiences heavy frost then dig up the tubers and store them in a cool dark place such as a garden shed for the winter.\n\n\nTry to avoid bringing them into a heated space like your home as they tend to rot under these conditions.\n Because of the difficulty establishing ranunculus as perennials (plants which flower year after year), many gardeners just treat them as annuals (plants which flower only one year). However, if you are determined to see yours bloom again, dig up your tubers for the winter, as described in the previous step.\n Ranunculus make a beautiful cut flower that generally remains healthy for awhile after being cut if measures are taken to preserve the cut. To preserve the life of cut ranunculus flowers, cut them early in the morning just as the buds are starting to open.\n\n\nA good clean cut using a sharp blade will help make the cut clean. Snip the stem at the base of the plant just about the crown and within the foliage. This avoids leaving exposed cut stems.\n\n"}

Otherwise, start from the front of your head and part your hair evenly down the middle.\n This keeps that side of your hair out of the way while you work on the other side. It\u2019s up to you which side you\u2019d like to start with, just make sure one side is secured and out of your way.\n Start near the front of your face and near the part. Take a 3 inch (7 cm) section of hair and divide it into three equal, smaller sections.\n A plait is just the first section of a braid. To make one, cross the front and back strands over the middle strand. Start with the back strand \u2013 the one closest to the back of your head \u2013 and cross it over the middle strand. Then cross the front strand over the middle.\n After you\u2019ve made the first plait, add another, small section of hair from behind the back strand to it. Then cross the thicker back strand over the middle strand. This allows you to incorporate more hair into the braid and keeping moving toward the back of your head.\n Instead, grab a section of hair from immediately underneath the front strand. Use this as your new front stand and incorporate into the braid by crossing it over the middle section. This creates a waterfall effect.\n Keep repeating the process until you reach your part. Then braid the loose hair at the end into a regular braid and tie it off with an elastic. You may need to pin it to get it out of the way as you work on the second braid.\n On the same side of your head where you created the waterfall braid, create a French braid. You should do this underneath, but close to, the first waterfall braid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivide a section of hair near the front of your face into three sections, using one waterfall piece as one of the sections. Cross the back strand over the middle, then the front. Once the first plait is complete, add the next waterfall section to the back strand, moving toward the back of your head.\n Once the French braid reaches your part, braid the loose hair into a regular braid. You should now have two regular braids from the first side of your hair.\n Take the hair on the opposite side of your head out of the elastic and repeat the whole process on that side of your head. Make sure you keep the braids close together to maintain the woven effect.\n Once you\u2019ve finished braiding your hair, gather all four regular braids (the ends of the waterfall and french braids on each side of your head) into one ponytail near the middle of the back of your head. Then take the smaller elastics out of each braid so that the hair in the ponytail is loose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might need to gently brush or run your fingers through the loose hair in the ponytail so the hair looks evenly distributed.\n Don\u2019t pull too hard, since you can pull the braids out. But pulling lightly on the edges makes the woven effect look thicker and more incorporated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Fever may also indicate the presence of infection.\n\n\nContinue to flush the area with warm, salty water. Bathe and wash as usual. While you may have discontinued baths when your catheter was inserted, showers are fine. Now that you've removed the catheter, you can take baths as well.\nYour urine should be clear or light yellow. Presence of light pink urine is also normal for the first 24 \u2013 48 hours following catheter removal, as a slight amount of blood may have entered the urinary tract. Urine that is dark red in color is a sign of blood, and foul-smelling or cloudy urine may indicate infection. If either of these are present, contact your medical provider immediately.\nYou may experience a slight rash on the area where your catheter has been removed. Cotton underwear allows for freer airflow to the area which aids healing.\n After removing a catheter, it's important to keep track of your urination patterns. If you have not urinated within eight hours of removing your catheter, contact your health care provider.\n\n\nIt's normal for urination to become a little irregular once your catheter is removed. It's common to find yourself needing to urinate more frequently than normal.\nYou may experience a slight discomfort when urinating. If this persists beyond 24 \u2013 48 hours following catheter removal, this may indicate infection.\nYou may also find that you have difficulty controlling your urine flow. This is not unusual. Keep track of incidents that concern you, and ask your medical provider about these incidents at your next visit.\nKeep a urination diary to help your doctor determine whether or not any further steps are needed on the path to your recovery.\n Drinking six to eight cups per day of water will help aid recovery of your urinary tract. Drinking a lot of water can help to increase your urine volume while also flushing out any bacteria or microorganisms in your bladder and urethra.Avoid drinking caffeine as it may irritate the bladder.Limit your fluid intake after 6:00 pm. Drinking too much liquid in the evening may wake you up during the night.\nElevate your feet when seated, particularly in the evening.\n\n"}

Add this to the skillet along with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and saute the vegetables for 10 to 15 minutes.Stir the vegetables frequently to prevent them from sticking to the skillet. The vegetables will become soft once they're finished sauteeing.\n Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). Transfer the sauteed vegetables to a large mixing bowl and stir in 1/4 cup (56 g) of the marinara sauce. Add 24 cooked mini-meatballs or pepperoni slices and stir the mixture well.You could use any meat instead of the mini-meatballs. For example, you could use cooked ground beef, chorizo, or Italian sausage.\n Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and set one pound (467 g) of refrigerated pizza dough on it.

Even if you're feeling rushed to get something done, even if you're busier than you can believe, you only need to grab 10 or 15 minutes to do a quick de-stress routine and calm yourself down, so you can get back to the task full-strength.\n\n\nIt's good to physically leave the space. If you're working on a paper, don't just close the window and start watching YouTube. Get up. Take a walk. See something that's not a computer for a while.\nIf you're busy watching your kids, or you're in a test, or can't physically leave the place that's stressing you out, you can still take a moment or two to center yourself and de-stress. You don't need to move or anything to calm yourself.;\n, Step back from what you're doing and close your eyes, or look at a blank wall, or through a window outside. Take 5-10 deep breaths, holding it for about 5 seconds, then releasing each slowly. Just doing this for a few minutes helps to bring your nervous system back into alignment, helping to calm the fight or flight response associated with high stress periods.Sit comfortably with your back straight. Put one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach and breathe in through your nose, enough so that the hand on your stomach rises, but the hand on your chest moves very little.\nExhale through your mouth. Push out as much air as you can and contract your abs. The hand on your stomach should move in as you exhale, but your other hand should move very little, counting slowly while you inhale and exhale.\n Taking a quick soak in warm water can be therapeutic, both in terms of stress and your physical well-being. Sit in the bath, wash your self, and practice your breathing exercises to give yourself a soothing stress-reducer.\n\n\nBaths should be warm, but not too hot, around 100-110 degrees F (37 C). Extremely hot baths actually ramp up your nervous system, and the relaxation is a bit of an illusion. Homeopathically speaking, hot baths do more to misalign your body and mind than a comfortable soak in a gently warm one.Combine warm baths with stretching for added therapeutic effect. Warm water softens muscles through a \u201cthixotropic\u201d effect, softening and making your muscles more pliable, making it easy to work out knots and stress spots with stretching.\n If you can't take a bath, taking a minute with a hot cup of green or herbal tea can have quick therapeutic effects, and give you a little treat as well, perfect for stress reduction.\n\n\nGreen tea has a high concentration of EGCG and antioxidants, helping to fight various cancers, as well as improving cholesterol levels and heart health.\nTea with hibiscus has been shown to reduce blood pressure levels in some patients, making it ideal for stress relief.Many teas include hibiscus, so read the ingredients to find one you like.\n Reaching out to your social network can help you de-stress in several ways. By calling a friend you can forget about your worries or problems for a little while, and allowing yourself to say things out loud can give you the feeling of \"releasing\" your tension into the world, even if your friend can't do much to solve your problems.\n\n\nIf you are stressing about a decision, you can also share what's stressing you and get their advice and come closer to making a decision.\n For many people, listening to wordless music is the equivalent of staring off into space, but for your ears. If you can, try playing some ambient drones or other soothing music quietly to help distract your brain from what's stressing you out, for a few minutes at least.\n\n\nCheck out YouTube for mixes of quiet ambience, from fire crackling to static hiss to burbling brooks, you can listen to soothing noises for free, sometimes looped to long sleep-able lengths.\nContrary to popular belief, there's no style or genre of music that's more relaxing than others. Some people like to bliss out to Mozart, while others need to blow off some steam with High on Fire or Darkthrone. Find your anti-stress band.\nMany people have found success relaxing to Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) videos on YouTube, which feature whispering, tapping, personal attention, and a variety of other relaxing sound triggers.\n Primal therapy, sometimes called \"scream\" therapy, was famously practiced by John Lennon, among other celebrities, and it involves periodically getting in touch with your primal rage centers, through ritualized yelling and other methods.While it's efficacy is debatable, and it ventures into regression therapy territory, it's true that giving a yell can trigger endorphin release, which can have a euphoric and calming effect.Go to a place where you won't disturb anyone and scream wordlessly for 10 or 15 seconds. But don't do it for too long, you might get a sore throat or damage your vocal chords.\n If you can steal 30 minutes of time or so, getting outside and exercising is a great way of de-stressing and getting your body primed for getting back to work. Exercise sometimes triggers an effect sometimes referred to as \"runners high,\" exercise has been shown to produce a significant mood enhancement effect, as soon as five minutes after getting some moderate exercise.You don't have to start training for a triathlon to get de-stressing. Taking a brisk 20-30 minute walk can get your muscles moving and your heart-rate up enough to trigger the effect. You can read about more exercise techniques in this article.\n Lots of people think a cigarette break, a shot of whiskey, or other types of relaxation are preferable to the methods suggested in this section. But alcohol, other drugs, and tobacco all have the tendency to raise your heart rate, increase your blood pressure, and otherwise increase, not receive, the physiological symptoms of stress.While it may seem like these things help, they're really making your stress more pronounced.\n\n\nSometimes, when stressed, certain people tend to overeat, or snack on unhealthy snacks. Having a snack can be a nice way of taking a quick break, but make sure it's something like carrots, or other fresh vegetables or fruits. Overeating because of stress can make you feel worse about your behavior, which will only add to your stress.\n\n"}

Try asking whatever you want in your normal voice and make sure you\u2019re polite about it. You may find that this gets you much farther in your request than whining to the adult.Make sure to use your usual voice or even try a whisper if that helps you. Say, \u201cMom, there is something I\u2019d like to ask you. Can I do that now?\u201d or \u201cMrs. Smith, may I please play with those colored pencils?\u201d\nAvoid asking for something if you\u2019re upset. Give yourself a couple of minutes to calm down and then ask in your normal voice.;\n, If you ask politely for something and are told \u201cno,\u201d thank the person for listening and accept the decision. This might be difficult for you, but it may help you get what you want in the long run.Tell the person, \u201cOk, thank you\u201d and walk away from the situation. Revisit your questions either later in the day or at a time when it seems more appropriate.\n If whining is a big problem for you, consider having a jar or box that you pay money into each time you whine. Then donate the money to a charity or something else you want, such as your school. Seeing your money go into a pot that you can\u2019t spend on yourself may help you stop whining.Let your parents know what you are doing. Tell them to say, \u201cGo put 25 cents in the jar\u201d whenever you whine.\nConsider asking your teacher to start a whine jar for your whole class. You can use that money to buy supplies for the classroom or donate money to a charitable cause you choose as a class.\n Chances are you are whining about something specific, such as you\u2019re out of bananas at home or there aren\u2019t any volleyballs available in gym class. Instead of whining about these to your parent or another adult, acknowledge the problem and then find a solution as well as an alternative activity.Figure out how you can overcome the problem quickly. For example, if you don\u2019t have any bananas at home, tell your mom, \u201cI\u2019m going to put them on our shopping list and have an apple instead.\u201d\nDistract yourself entirely if needed. For example, if you really wanted to play volleyball but can\u2019t find one, consider improvising by throwing a soft rubber ball against a wall.\n Everyone\u2014including your parents-- whines occasionally and that is ok. But if your parents whine a lot, you may find that this affects your behavior, too. Telling your mom or dad when he or she whines may help you stop whining around them so often.Make sure to be polite and nice when you\u2019re pointing out your parents\u2019 whining so they don\u2019t get mad. You could say, \u201cMom, please don\u2019t whine when you ask me to take out the dog. I need to finish this math problem and then I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nConsider asking your parents to contribute to the whine jar. You could donate the proceeds or use it towards a family fun day.\n In many cases, what others perceive as whining is just how you\u2019re speaking to get the person\u2019s attention. Actively listening to yourself in situations that might cause you to whine can keep you from doing so. In addition, it might help you get what you want.Try and use sentences instead of words, which may naturally help you keep your voice inflections within a normal range. Instead of saying, \u201cPleeease,\u201d you can say, \u201cWould you please do this for me? It would be a huge help.\u201d This can prevent the person to whom you are talking from shutting down completely and get him or her to listen to you.\nRemove yourself from a situation if you don\u2019t think you can control your voice. Come back to your statement once you\u2019ve had a chance to calm down.\n Just like your voice, your face and eyes are mirrors of your feelings and emotions. Consider your expressions when you\u2019re making a statement that would otherwise be whining. Trying to be genuine in your voice inflections can also change the expressions in your face and eyes.Try giving a small smile when you\u2019re talking so that your words, face, and eyes follow suit. For example, if your wife or husband is going away again, say, \u201cI love you so much and love spending time together. It would be nice if you could give me a bit more notice when you\u2019re traveling so I can prepare myself to be alone for a few days.\u201d Visualize yourself saying this in a non-whiny tone with a neutral face. If you need to, look elsewhere so that the person to whom you are speaking doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re pointing daggers out of your eyes.\n Like children, many adults will whine continuously to wear down another person. In many cases, this is a very effective tactic because the person doesn\u2019t want to listen to you whine any longer. If you need to make a whiny comment, say it once and then move on. Not doing so may result in you angering the other person and hurting your reputation.\n\n\nMake your request or statement only once. Any more and you\u2019re indulging in the behavior of a child\u2014and you\u2019re not a child, nor do you want others to think you are. Part of being an adult is accepting that you can\u2019t always have things exactly your way. For example, say, \u201cCan you pleeeeaase take me off the project? I can\u2019t handle working with Alex,\u201d or \u201cOof, I just don\u2019t want to work with Alex on this.\u201d Accept whatever comes after your statement and move on to whatever you need to do.\nConsider finding something to distract yourself if you feel the need to harangue someone with whining to get your way.\n Another common tactic whiners use to get their way is the guilt trip\u2014done in a whiny voice. Guilt is another form of aggression, which is something you want to avoid with people.If you commonly guilt-trip people into getting your way, take a step back before making statements that may make another person feel guilty. This can ultimately stop you from using whiny guilt trips to get your way.\n\n\nUse open communication with a person instead of a guilt trip. Keep in mind that this is more constructive and can save your relationship with the person instead of ultimately upsetting him or her. For example, say, \u201cI appreciate the assignment and am excited to participate in the project. But I am concerned that the poor working relationship Chris and I have may have an affect on the overall project. Can you suggest a way to get around this?\u201d This statement sounds much better than, \u201cUgh, can you take me off of this project. I won\u2019t be able to concentrate or function if I have to work with Chris.\u201d, There is an old truism that holds \u201cYou win a lot more bees with honey than vinegar.\u201d Kindness breeds kindness just as much as being whiny or nasty breeds nastiness. Remembering these simple facts can help you keep your interactions as positive and kind as possible. This may keep you from whining to those you love or with whom you work and create a more positive environment for everyone.\n You may find that you consistently whine about the same things. Friends, colleagues, lack of finances, and many other things may irritate or annoy you, causing you to complain. Recognizing sources of negativity can help start making positive change.Write a list of things that cause you to whine. You could even ask a trusted friend or family member if they notice that you complain about something a lot. Go over your list and figure out things you can change. For example, you can reframe or eliminate relationships that make you whine a lot. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat is it about Chris that causes me to moan and complain so often? If I limit my exposure to him will it help me complain less?\u201d\n\n, Whining and complaining can be draining. Being happy and positive is often invigorating. Finding the positive in anything can help you whine less.Remember that even in the most whine-inducing situation, there is likely something positive. For example, maybe your colleague opted to teach the same course so you got stuck with a large class. Instead of complaining about what a lazy loser the person is, say to yourself, \u201cOther colleagues realize that Chris is not carrying his weight in courses. Thankfully, they realize I\u2019m putting forth a huge effort.\u201d, There are many things that may cause you to complain from sticking to your goals to how you interact with others. It\u2019s important to remember to keep your expectations realistic, such as what you can easily do in a typical workday. This can also reduces stress that may cause you to be more whiny.See if your expectations are realistic by looking at the plan you\u2019ve developed. For example, depending on how much you make, you may not be able to save $100 every month. But you may be able to save $50 every month, which is still saving. Remember to give yourself a little wiggle room. Accepting that you and others are not perfect can help you complain less and attain your goals.\n You\u2019ll occasionally need to whine or vent. This is completely normal and acceptable, but acknowledge the problem, vent, and then let it go. This can keep you positive and help you not dwell on something that may make you complain too often., Reminding yourself that many others are less fortunate can do wonders for you. It can put things that make you whine into broader perspective and realize that your concerns are not as significant as others\u2019. It may also keep you from dwelling on things that make you whine.Offer to volunteer at a health facility or organization that helps the less fortunate. Recognizing that you really don\u2019t have anything about which to complain can help you focus on the positive. Even giving your support to friends and family members who are struggling can help you whine less.\n\n"}

A reusable kit can become part of a lifestyle, turning many \u201cdisasters\u201d into inconveniences or even adventures.\n It is tempting and it will take some discipline, but resist the urge to say \u201cI might need this\u201d. A kit that is too large or too heavy is many times just as useless as no kit at all.\n This is one of the highest priorities. The sun will bake you, the rain will freeze you (hypothermia can set in quickly during the fall, spring, and winter if you are wet), and unless you are lucky enough to be stuck in a benign environment (like Tahiti), lack of shelter will be more than an inconvenience. Shelter can be a tent or tarp, a trash bag or tube tent (if you just want to survive), or a Winnebago. A great thing is a rip stop nylon poncho that folds flat and can be used as a tent. These are very versatile, they are lightweight, very tough, they do double or triple duty (a must if your kit is to be light enough to carry), and some of these can be used together to make a larger tent if you are with others. Make sure you have a small rope and stakes along.\n There are recommendations galore for how much water to put into your kit. Have 130-160 oz per day minimum, depending on your size. If you are very small take the former, larger, the latter. This is the lowest amount you should take. Any less than this and you will start to seriously gamble with your life. The government says one gallon per person per day - but this includes water for washing, cooking, etc. Options for water include sterilized boxes, sterilized Mylar bags, water bottles, and reusable containers. The sterilized water (bag or box) are awfully convenient if you don\u2019t let their relative unavailability keep you from using them when you need to. They have a 5-year shelf life and you can just forget about them. Water bottles have to be replaced yearly and take up a lot of extra space - but are otherwise good. You can also get reusable containers (generally collapsible plastic) which work well if you sterilize the water (and keep it sterilized) or wash them and replace the water often. Water purification tablets are an option, but due to their taste (they can make you sick) you may not want them. Some Sporting outfitters have water purification systems.\n There are plenty of options but the best require no preparation and no utensils or dishes to eat. Food bars of all types fall into this category, as do granola, GORP, etc. They all work well but should be replaced yearly or according to their expiration dates. The Coast Guard uses a food bar with a five-year shelf life. Get ones with lots of variety, such as nuts, whole grains, etc. Living on food bars for three days isn\u2019t too bad except that you\u2019d swim the English Channel for a burger by the end. The next best type of food is the Mylar type - Mylar bags of tuna, MREs (ready eat meals), etc. They do require utensils, but the tuna can be eaten out of the bag, as can the MREs albeit with a bit more difficulty. The excessive amounts of packaging and superfluous items in MREs might prevent you from using them as a serious food source if space and weight are an issue. Note: eat as healthily as possible. Do not fall for the \u201ctake plenty of candy and junk food for comfort and energy\u201d gig. Sugar causes a crash in energy proportional to its high. It also stresses out the body, and in a stressful situation it is the last thing that should be eaten. Whole grains, nuts, etc. will give gradual, even energy and provide the necessary fats, proteins, and nutrients needed \u2013 needs which increase during times of stress.\n Wool and fleece are the best blanket choices. Both retain heat even when wet, wool is flame retardant, fleece is very lightweight. If you are in an area where fire is likely an issue, stick with the wool unless it is just too heavy. Stay away from cotton, as it wicks heat from your body when it is moist. Get orange blankets if you can, this is a lot of surface area for signaling (even if a child is wrapped up in it). It is a good idea to include a foil type of emergency blanket. They fold up very small and can act as a ground cloth, they can retain body heat, act as a vapor barrier and wind breaker, etc. Don\u2019t buy all the hype about its amazing heat reflection properties, though - it only reflects radiant heat - and it is, after all, just foil. Persons in very cold climates might investigate buying a down sleeping bag for all of your camping and storing it in your 72-hour kit. It packs incredibly small and light and is amazingly warm.\n Toilet paper, cotton bandanna (for face mask, washcloth, etc), baby wipes, soap, potty bags, and an N95 dust/virus mask are essentials. Additional important items include a toothbrush/paste, latex gloves, and feminine napkins.\n Do not get a standard first aid kit with 3,200 band aids and a few aspirin. Get a roll of gauze, some gauze pads, medical tape, some painkillers, alcohol wipes, some burn/wound cream, some blood coagulant (such as cayenne, which is also antibiotic), and some petroleum jelly or some other lubricant/moisturizer. You\u2019ll have to make your own band aids from gauze and tape, but you\u2019ll be able to cover most other minor injuries.\n Again, do not over pack. You need light (light sticks or a crank flashlight), warmth (heat packs), and a whistle. Additional \u2018might need\u2019 items are: fire starting kit, multi-use pliers, firearms, small rope, hand crank radio, duct tape, and a folding saw. You might want to take a small pocketknife (with a saw, scissor, tweezers, sharp knife, hook) Generally everything else isn\u2019t needed. If you live in rural Idaho, you might pack a bit of fishing string and a hook, but don\u2019t overdo it. A well thought out selection of tools already in a kit is www.Gorgimi.com, follow the links to their \"Tools\".\n A Rubbermaid is easy to access but don\u2019t try to carry it anywhere and the lid can come off easily. Dry bags, duffels, day packs, etc are all viable options depending on your budget and location. If you want to be able to carry it, and want it to be waterproof (a good idea - keep in mind that most natural disasters in the US are related to water), a dry bag that can be carried as a backpack is the best option. Many are tough and waterproof, and a few can be carried in several different ways. Zip top freezer bags (these are heavier than \"storage\" bags) can keep like items grouped together within your pack and keep them dry, too. If it's a vital item, like matches, pack the item in two bags, with the zippered ends pointing in different directions.

By cleaning the unit every couple of weeks, you may minimize the number of false alarms you experience or avoid them altogether.Make sure to dust or clean not only the outside cover of your unit, but also inside the cover, where dust often accumulates.You can use a dusting brush or vacuum the alarm with the soft brush attachment.If you are in a new home or having construction done, make sure that the electricians use a dust cover to keep the alarm from gathering debris.;\n, Insects may get caught in your alarm because they are attracted to the sound or even light that the unit may emit. If the alarm is going off with no smoke or visible fire, check for and for insects on the cover or sensor chamber., If you have an interconnected system of fire alarms, a unit in another part of your home may be triggering connected fire alarms. Keep alarms on separate electrical currents to help prevent them from triggering one another.If your units are connected and there is no way to separate them from a power source, make sure to check for smoke so that you are sure there is no fire.\nPower interruptions may also trigger the alarm, especially if you live in an area where utility companies switch the grids., If your smoke alarm is on an AC or AC/DC electrical system, make sure to tighten any loose connections. This can help the unit avoid chirping or going off fully.Loose hot wire connections may occasionally disconnect power, which has the same effect as a power outage.If you are unsure of the wiring, contact an electrician to help you.\n Furnaces and ovens not only produce combustion particles that may trigger the alarm, but they also may smoke because of oil and residue. Installing your fire alarms at least 10 feet from a furnace or oven may minimize the number of false alarms you experience.Furnaces can blow debris in ductwork into your smoke alarm and make it go off.You may notice more false alarms in the fall when you first begin using the furnace after the summer., Areas that experience cold air returns, which suck cold air back into a furnace, are more susceptible to false alarms. Keeping your alarm away from cold air returns may prevent dusty air from blowing through the alarm and keep it from going into alarm mode.Place the alarm at least 10 feet from a cold air return., Places in your home that may have high humidity, such as the bathroom or kitchen, are more susceptible to false alarms. Installing the smoke alarm at least 10 feet from high humidity areas.Install the alarm at least 10 feet from showers, laundry rooms, and kitchen sinks or dishwashers., Places in your home, such as the garage, workroom, or living room may emit exhaust gasses or flames that can trigger an alarm. Avoiding placing your smoke alarm in areas exposed to exhaust gases or open flames may help minimize or prevent false alarms. Note that in some areas heat detectors are required in garages. Contact your local fire department for more information.\n\n\nDo not locate smoke detectors near a fireplace or other open flame heating systems such as oil & gas furnaces.\n One of the most common causes of false smoke alarms is a weak battery. A chirping noise means that the battery is weak, and needs to be replaced. Replace batteries regularly, such as twice a year, to help prevent false alarms and the annoyance of consistent chirping., Electronic devices can fail at any time, so maintaining and testing them can help ensure proper function. Regular testing can help prevent a fire or damage to your home or family.Press the test button on the smoke detector. It may take a few seconds, but you should hear a loud and ear-piercing siren while the button is depressed.If there is no sound or weak sound, replace your batteries.Ask a family member to go into the farthest room from the alarm to make sure that anyone in the house can hear it.Light a match and blow it out directly under the alarm. After that, place the match in a glass of watch and make sure it\u2019s extinguished. If the alarm doesn\u2019t go off, you may need new batteries, new wiring, or a new unit."}

However, copyright infringement cases must be filed in federal court. If you're filing for both, you will need to file in federal court.\nGenerally, you must file in the court located in the county or district where the person you're suing lives or conducts business., Typically the court will have a form or template you can use to create your complaint.Start with the caption, which will take up roughly the top-third of your first page. You can copy this from another complaint filed in the same court, but use your name for the plaintiff and the person you're suing as the defendant.\nLeave the case number blank. The clerk will assign this number when you file your lawsuit.\nYour complaint generally should be single-spaced, with a double space between paragraphs. Set up your page with one-inch margins on all sides.\n Your complaint identifies you and the person or company you are suing to the court, explains what has happened, and what you want the court to do about it.Begin your complaint with a sentence such as \"Comes now the plaintiff, , and respectfully alleges as follows:\" and then proceed with numbered paragraphs.\nLook to the complaints or templates you found for examples. Generally, you should include only one fact per numbered paragraph, referring to yourself as \"Plaintiff\" and the person you're suing as \"Defendant.\"\nBegin by identifying yourself, then identifying the person you're suing. Continue your numbered paragraphs with each of the allegations that together make up the elements of the claim listed in the law.\nStart with the facts, then explain why those facts give you the right to sue that person under the law. For example, you might write \"On October 12, 2014, Plaintiff took photos of herself with her smart phone.\" The next paragraph might be \"Plaintiff then texted the photos to Defendant.\" Then you would write \"Defendant understood that these photos were not to be shared with anyone else.\"\nContinue describing the incident and the facts that proceeded, all the way up to the threat of publication \u2013 or actual publication \u2013 of your private photos.\nThe last paragraph of your complaint is your \"prayer for relief,\" in which you ask the court for monetary damages or other relief to compensate you for the harms caused by the defendant.\nIf the person has not yet published the photos at the center of your claim, you should ask for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order to stop the person from publishing those photos., You must take your complaint and copies to the clerk of the court where you want to file your lawsuit.Before you go to the clerk's office, make at least two copies of everything you plan to file. The clerk will keep the originals, so you'll need one for your own records and one to have delivered to the person you're suing.\nYou may want to call the clerk's office ahead of time to find out if you have to include any other documents with your complaint, what filing fees you'll have to pay, and any other information you'll need to file your lawsuit.\nTo file your lawsuit, you'll have to pay a filing fee \u2013 typically several hundred dollars. If you can't afford this, ask the clerk if you can apply for a waiver. Most courts don't charge filing fees if your income falls below a certain threshold. You must fill out an application and provide information about your income and assets.\nWhen you go to the clerk's office, he or she will stamp \"filed\" with the date on your originals and copies, and give you back your copies. The originals will be kept for the court's official records.\n Once your lawsuit is filed, you must have someone deliver a copy of it to the person you are suing so he or she has proper legal notice of the lawsuit.While you often can serve court documents using certified mail, most courts require a complaint to be hand-delivered to the defendant.\nAlthough technically any person over the age of 18 who isn't involved in the lawsuit can do this, you typically want to pay a sheriff's deputy or private process server.\n If you requested an injunction from the court to keep the defendant from publishing your photos, the court often will schedule a preliminary hearing to determine whether that order should be issued.At the hearing, you generally must be able to show that if the defendant published (or continued to publish) your photos, it would cause a greater amount of harm.\nYou also must have enough evidence to demonstrate that you are likely to prevail in the lawsuit itself.\nSome states have a presumption for certain types of private photos, wherein you are entitled to a preliminary injunction unless the defendant can prove that the law does not apply \u2013 for example, because you had already made the photos available to the general public."}

The lawn sets the tone for the rest of the home, so if it's spooky enough, it'll make people even curious to see what you have in store up-close. Here are some easy ways to decorate your lawn:Old crunchy fall leaves should cover the ground. If there haven't been many fallen leaves, you should avoid raking your lawn during the days leading up to Halloween to make the most of what you have.\nTake an old pair of boots and have them emerging out of a big pile of leaves or dirt. This will make it look like there's a dead body on your lawn!\nStick tombstones out of the ground. Remember that Halloween is all about things being old, dingy, and falling-apart, so your lawn does not have to be perfectly arranged. Have a tombstone here, a tombstone there, and another tombstone that is completely crooked or falling over.\nIf you have trees, cover them with spider webs. Bonus points if you can stick some creepy-crawly critters in them, or if you can add a stuffed owl or raven to a low-hanging branch.\nDon't underestimate the power of a scary scarecrow. You can get a special Halloween scarecrow, or take your ordinary corn-husk fall scarecrow and paint it with blood.\nThrow some skulls around the ground. Kudos if one of your guests accidentally stumbles on one of them.\nHave a skeleton popping out of your yard.\nIf you really want to do it up for Halloween, have your car parked out on the lawn. Paint the windows to make it look like they're cracked, and make it look like a person is trapped inside by putting in a dummy with its hands pushed against the windows.;\n, Your front porch will be the portal to all of the creepy things inside your home, so it should be as scary as possible to lure your unsuspecting guests (or victims) inside your house of horrors. Here are some great ways to add some Halloween spice to your front porch:\n\n\nAdd some more spiderwebs to your porch. Your guests could get caught in them without knowing it.\nThe silhouette of a black cat or two will raise the creep factor.\nA few stuffed rats on the floor will help set the scene.\nA bucket of dead white flowers will look perfect on your porch.\nScatter some tree branches on the ground.\nA few pumpkins will add a nice touch to your porch. They can be carved with ghoulish designs, or painted black, silver, or with glitter.\nHang a ghost from your porch. Just cut some holes in an old sheet and throw it over an old beach ball that you hang from the ceiling.\nIf you have an old rocking chair, cover it with spider webs and put it in a place where it will rock and creak as much as possible.\n The door and window are the eyes and mouth of your home's Halloween soul, so you should make the most of them. Adding just a few ghoulish touches to your front door and windows will make your house look haunted. Here are a few things to try:\n\n\nHave a spooky doormat. It can have a picture of a spiderweb or a ghost on it.\nHang a wreath covered in bats on the front door.\nSplatter some fake blood on your front door. Just make sure it can easily come off.\nIf you're really going all out, make it look like you've boarded up your windows by sticking some light wood beams over the glass and sticking them to the glass with duct tape. This will make your house look abandoned, and therefore spooky.\nTake an old mannequin and cover it in a formal black or red dress. Stick it in a window that everyone will see, preferably a second-floor or attic window if you have one. Shine a flashlight under the mannequin to create a ghostly effect.\n\n"}

This means understanding plot lines, being able to bring characters to life, and being expressive with words. Moreover, writing for television is very different from other types of narrative writing, because you have to consider time constraints, commercial breaks, and other factors as well.For writing classes, you can either go to school to earn a degree in creative writing or English, but look for a program that specializes in entertainment industry writing.\nIf you don\u2019t have the time or money for an entire degree, look for online classes or courses at a local college that you can take to help hone your art. Look for a creative writing course or a class that\u2019s specific to television writing if possible.;\n, There may be no better way to learn how to write for television\u2014and soap operas specifically\u2014than to be taught or mentored by someone who has already done it. Some television stations offer mentoring or writing programs for aspiring writers, and will pair writers with staff writers, showrunners, and network executives., Specs, which is short for speculative screenplays, are scripts that aspiring writers write in the hopes of landing jobs. To write a spec, choose a television show that you like and write an episode for it. When writing a spec, there are several things to remember, including:\n\n\nBe true to the format: make sure the length of your script matches the half-hour or hour-long nature of the show, work in commercial breaks, and write a proper television script.Specs have to be original and innovative, but they also have to adhere to the nature of the show. Essentially, you want to write the episode as though you were actually a staff writer for that show. To do this, you'll need a good understanding of the show\u2019s plot, characters, and tone.\nThe purpose of a spec is to show employers that you can write, that you can tell a story, and that you understand the basic structure of a narrative (including putting scenes and acts together).Once you\u2019ve finished a spec, don\u2019t be afraid to edit and tighten it up. Once you're happy with it, start another. Specs are like resumes in the TV writing industry, and a good spec can land you a job. You'll get better with each one you write, so don\u2019t be discourage if nobody\u2019s biting after your first or second spec.\n While specs are important in the entertainment industry, they don\u2019t interest everyone, and most people will want to see that you're a versatile writer who can work in other formats as well. And it\u2019s not always specs that get writers hired: sometimes it can be a screenplay, short story, or other piece of writing that catches someone\u2019s attention.\n\n\nThe more you write the more you'll improve, and making it as a writer takes a lot of talent, finesse, and practice.In the entertainment industry, people are always trying to discover the next new thing, so aspire to write something innovative, creative, and interesting that will grab the attention of the people who read it. Try for things that are quirky, wacky, unconventional, and original.\n Soap are known for their over-the-top story lines that are still based in reality. Also, soap operas aren't designed to ever give viewers closure, and since the story line is always open-ended, most episodes end on a cliff hanger that\u2019s designed to bring viewers back the next day. Some tropes that are common in soap operas include:Characters often get pregnant when they aren't expecting to, especially if there's a one-night stand or an extramarital affair.\nMost of the characters are related somehow, even if they don\u2019t know it.\nCharacters, especially younger ones, often age much faster than everyone else.\nCharacters who are killed off can still return, especially if the body wasn\u2019t found.\n It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, and it\u2019s not a sure way to get discovered, but sometimes networks host writing contests for aspiring writers, While the prizes are often money, sometimes these contests can lead to opportunities with shows or networks, especially if your writing catches the eye of the right person.\n In entertainment writing, the first opportunity to make money in the business often comes from freelancing. These days, most of the scripts that are created for TV are written by staff writers and producers, but each series will also hire freelance writers throughout every season.\n Every TV show, including soap operas, has a bible that lays out the theme of the show, and writers and producers will use this bible as a guide when creating material. If you're trying to get work as a freelancer or staff writer for a particular show, you should study the bible so you know what kind of content they\u2019ll be looking for.When you know the bible for the show you're working on or trying to get a job with, you'll be able to pitch better ideas and write content that\u2019s in line with the show\u2019s themes and style.\nIf you land an interview to write for a particular show, make sure you know the bible inside and out before going to the interview. This way, you'll be able to pitch better and more impressive ideas.\n Anybody in the entertainment industry, including actors, musicians, and writers, can benefit from having an agent, because it\u2019s the job of an agent to get jobs for clients. Moreover, many producers, executives, and showrunners are too busy to look at scripts that are sent in unsolicited, so an agent may be your only way to get a foot in the door.When looking for agents, ask for referrals from people you know and trust. Agents are busy people too, but if you have a connection, you'll have a better chance of finding someone who will take you on.If you're having trouble finding representation, check the agency list provided by the Writers Guild of America. From there, research a newer agent who specializes in the same kind of writing that you do, and send a query letter directly to that person.\n Sometimes, getting into the entertainment industry as a writer means starting out somewhere else, and many people who are in the industry today began as assistants.\n\n\nBeing an assistant will give you some great insight into the industry, and if you can land a job as a writer\u2019s assistant, that\u2019s even better. Not only can that person act as a mentor, but it will also help you build relationships and connections that could lead to a job down the road.Assistant jobs can also lead to a promotion to staff writer, so if this is the route you want to go, try to get a job on a show you would like to write for. Showrunners or producers will be much more likely to hire somebody they know, and this is particularly true when you know the show and the characters inside and out., Agent or no agent, the key to getting a job as a writer for a soap opera is to get samples of your writing into the right hands. This will be a lot easier if you have a job as an assistant or have an agent, but you can do it yourself with enough perseverance and some luck.\n\n\nSend your specs to as many people as you can: other writers, producers, showrunners, creators, or anyone else who might have the power to hire you. If you write a new spec or make some really great edits to an older one, send it out again.\nIf anybody offers you constructive criticism, take it to heart. Listening to the opinions of people in the industry may just get you the advice you need to land a job.\nWhen you do send out your specs, make sure you follow up.This can be as simple as sending an email that says you sent your script and are looking forward to hearing back.\n\n"}

This item allows Gabite to gain experience even when it's not in battle. Whenever the Pok\u00e9mon that is holding the Exp. Share gains experience, Gabite will gain some as well (as long as they're both in your party)., The best way to gain experience for Gabite is to simply use it in battle as much as possible. You'll get more experience for fighting tougher enemies., If you're trying to power-level your Gabite, you'll do it most efficiently if you're fighting high-level enemies that are weak to its attacks. This will let you mow through more enemies in less time, gaining lots of experience.\n\nGabite has a lot of Ground moves which are highly effective against Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel Pokemon.\nGabite's Dragon moves are effective against most other types, making them powerful moves to use when leveling. Avoid fighting Steel and Fairy Pokemon, as Dragon attacks are weak or completely useless against them.\n Giving a Gabite a Rare Candy will raise it one level immediately. This can be useful for getting the last level before evolving., Gabites received via trade will gain 1.5x the regular experience, which will significantly boost your evolution speed. If you can get a Gabite from another country or language, it will gain 1.7x the normal amount of experience.You can't trade a Gabite to someone and then have them trade it back. The Gabite must have been caught on a different system.\n The Everstone will prevent Gabite from evolving when it reaches the right level. Make sure Gabite isn't holding one., Use the steps in the previous method to raise Gabite to Level 48. Once it reaches this level, it will attempt to evolve into Garchomp., You may want to prevent Gabite from evolving until after it learns Dragon Rush at level 49. It will take Garchomp until Level 55 to learn this move.To cancel an evolution, press and hold B while the Gabite is evolving. This will cancel the evolution and prevent it from turning into Garchomp.\nOnce the Gabite reaches Level 49, it will learn Dragon Rush and then try to evolve again. You can now let it safely evolve, as there are no more moves that Gabite will learn, and Dragon Rush is a very powerful move to have for your new Garchomp that it normally wouldn't learn for another seven levels.\n\n"}

Giving yourself an hour time limit may help you get your words down on paper. Sticking to a consistent writing time every day will allow you to get into a routine and make it easier to get the poem done.;\n, You should try to create a space that is suitable for writing so you are motivated to write one new poem a day. Look for a space in your home that is quiet and isolated from others so you can focus on your writing. You may also try to find a quiet, private space at school or at work and make this area your unofficial writing spot.For example, you may find a quiet spot in your school library and use this area as your writing spot.

If you are leading a work group, get all the research and reports sent out a few days ahead of time so that everyone can be on the same page for the meeting.\n Starting and ending meetings require an outspoken person who will keep track of time and any remaining agenda items. Wear a watch and refer back to it occasionally to make sure you are on track.\n\nAnnounce the start and end time in your communication with group members. Also, consider announcing topics and the time structure so that members can adequately prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne important structure to announce is whether it is an open group and whether the group has \u201ccross-talk.\u201d This means that the group can discuss, rather than just sharing an opinion when it is their turn.\n It can be exhausting to lead a group, especially for professional and emotional topics. Get a good night sleep and do some deep breathing techniques before you start the group meeting., Sitting in a circle is a classic approach, because no one is left out. Move chairs into a circle before anyone else arrives.\n\n\nAvoid a \u201cclassroom\u201d approach. If everyone must see you, but can\u2019t see each other, you will be more of an authority figure and have a harder time encouraging discussion between group members.\n It is your job to encourage participation without affecting the outcome. If you are an opinionated person, practice holding your tongue in political or opinionated discussions., Keep it brief, but announce your qualifications or interest in the success of the group. Aim to keep the introduction between one and two minutes long.\n Groups like Alcoholics Anonymous have steps and traditions that are to be read at the beginning of each meeting. Don\u2019t go overboard with rules, as they might restrict expression in the group.\n If there are desired outcomes or agenda points, review them now. Set times if necessary.\n If you are leading a small group, you may be able to go around in a circle (Round Robin) so that everyone has a chance to speak. If you are leading a large group, you may need to encourage the raising of hands or free speaking.\n\n\nAnnounce the structure of the group before you start, so that everyone has the same expectations.\n You are serving as a neutral party, not a teacher.\n Avoid asking questions to the group with yes or no answers. If they must be yes/no answers, ask group members to elaborate on why that is the answer., Good follow-up questions include \u201cHow does that change the way you feel about X,Y,Z?\u201d and \u201cHow do you think that applies to other issues that we are discussing?\u201d\n\n, If you are afraid that the group is too large to encourage adequate participation, small group work is a good way to encourage everyone in a group to interact.\n Encourage positive interactions. Thank people for their contributions.\n\n\nDon\u2019t be critical. Even if your group is created for critiques, criticism should be only give in small doses. Start each comment with positive reinforcement.\n Between subjects, encourage people to play a game, watch a related YouTube clip or get up and move around.\n It is your job as the group leader to recognize potential arguments and try to move on in a productive way.\n\n\nSay, \u201cIt sounds like we have a difference of opinion.\u201d\n\u201cDifferent points of view are encouraged in our group.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds like you both feel passionate about this.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems that we can agree on X,Y,Z.\u201d\n\n, This is a good way for people to feel joint ownership of a group and its goals.\n Ask people to take a questionnaire or discuss changes or issues wit you.\n\n"}

Try not to get the wipe too far into your vagina; you should only be cleaning the outside (vulva). Use wipes which are unscented and contain as few chemicals as possible.\n Changing your underwear 2-3 times a day can help the problem. This will help keep bacteria away from your vagina and will also reduce your discomfort and the smell.\n\n\nMake sure you're wearing the right kind of underwear, since wearing the wrong kind can even be causing the problem! Wear cotton underwear with good ventilation (meaning those skinny jeans you wear can also be causing the problem).\n Try to get as much air exposure as possible. Sleep naked or walk around your house without pants or underwear if you can. The air will help keep your skin from becoming irritated and decreasing opportunities for infection. It can also help treat the problem itself, if your body simply has an imbalance of bacteria, since it will give your body the opportunity to restore itself to normal.\n Generally you want to avoid these, as usually your body creates the discharge to get rid of something and keeping that something close to your body is not the best idea. However, if you are in a situation where you really need to keep the discharge in check or the discharge is so bad it cannot be controlled, you can use a pad or pantyliner. Try to change it as often as possible.\n\n\nDon't use douches. Many douches that are bought at the store contain \"scents\" or soaps, these may make you feel cleaner in the short term, but in the long run will actually make the problem worse. They will disrupt the natural pH of your vagina and cause it to work overtime to get back to its normal state.\n Many herbal remedies are effective in eradicating the infection of vaginal mucosa. Many of them also have astringent action to reduce the flow of abnormal discharge.\n\n\nHerbs like Pippali are believed to cleanse your body by eliminating infection causing organisms from your body.\nHerbs like Saraca ashoka, Symplocos racemosa, Cyperus rotundus, Ficus benghalensis, vetiveria zizanioides, Andropogon muricatus and Acacia confusa reduce the vaginal discharge due to their astringent properties.\nHerbs such as Cimicifuga Racemosa assist in eradication of fungal infection and for reducing inflammation, which is associated with leucorrhoea.\n\n"}

It's a way of enjoying what we're experiencing rather than always rushing toward an end just to make room for the next rush. Patience allows us to enjoy the process of living. Patience also enables others to accept us into their lives through our faithful, continued presence and enduring respect for them. When we accept the importance of patience in our lives, it becomes easier to be patient with others too. Through respecting the rhythm of ourselves and others, being patient presents an opportunity to give of ourselves rather than expecting others to conform to our wants.\n\n\nSee How to be patient for some more general ideas on letting a little more patience into your life.;\n, Resist the impulse to have things the way you'd like them to be. Even a very young child can indicate their likes and dislikes; allowing these to express themselves at appropriate occasions is important. As part of asking for the child's preferences, be sure to show that you've heard the answer; aim to paraphrase the child's response so that it's clear you understand.\n\n\nResist the temptation to change the child's mind about a future occupation. If little Johnny says he wants to be a window washer when he grows up, let it be. If you constantly interrupt with something like \"Oh he's just saying that. We all know he'll be a doctor when he grows up\", he'll start to resent the implications of being pushed toward a designated career.\nBalance the wants with realities. If you think that what the child is asking for is unreasonable, unaffordable, or a sign of \"consumeritis\", take time to talk it through rather than simply saying no or choosing for them without discussion. You don't have to reason with the child but it helps to give a brief explanation. It helps even more if you show by example what you're asking the child to follow.\n Where possible, try to please them. This isn't about being a doormat for the child's commands. It's about respecting the wants and requests of the child within the appropriateness of the situation. Help the child to learn the difference between making a request and making a demand and what the consequences are. It is also important to help them understand the importance of delayed gratification, teaching them that when you do say no, sometimes this is about waiting, rather than never having or doing what they've asked for. Helping them to understand this time perspective is far kinder than simply saying no and not explaining any further.\n When the daily chores mount up and everyone is rushing about, sometimes it's easy to take one another for granted. Taking time now and then to express your gratitude for your children will help you to respect them for the unique, individual beings they are, and helps them to see the importance of valuing others openly.\n Be willing to do things the child's way when possible. While their attempts might sometimes cause you frustration and worry, it is important to allow children to show you their way of doing things. If your child offers to help with making dinner, don't think of the mess they'll make. Accept that there will be a mess but realize that they're learning how to do something that will one day be of great importance as a skill (and eventually, they'll be making some of the household meals, relieving you of the burden occasionally). In watching and learning from your child or from other children, you will learn their character better, and see both their strengths and their weaknesses, giving you an opportunity to help them nurture the best talents and to learn to manage their weaknesses.\n\n\nIf you do not allow children to do things their way, this takes away their autonomy and potentially stunts their ability to discover things for themselves. Allow a child to try new things often, so as to give them a sense of self-trust and personal responsibility.\nNaturally, keep safety and propriety in mind; it is entirely appropriate to step in and change the course of a child's behavior or activities where safety or appropriateness have been compromised; this is simply part of being responsible guardians.\n Remember that children have feelings, likes, dislikes, favorite foods, colors, etc. Honor these things when possible.\n Children are ready to trust and soak up information from the people who care for them and spend time with them. Trying to control children lacks respect for their own self and is a way of trying to insert your way of thinking and preferences onto them. Give them space to grow into the individual that they are.\n\n\nPatience allows you to be the ideal teacher. Instead of seeking to control, patience allows the child to grow at their own pace, rather than being pushed into doing things before being ready. For example, Dino de Laurentiis did not speak until he was 5. Despite the worries of others, his mother took this in her stride, believing he'd speak more than enough when he was ready. And so he did!Try this: see if you can say \"yes\" to the child, before you say \"no\". If your first instinct is to say \"no\", question this. Actually, why not? Are you just being controlling, or is there a good reason to deny their request?\n\n, Most choices are not a life and death situation. Give children a rope long enough for them to safely learn on their own. Mistakes are a learning experience.\n\n\nIf you feel that a situation is getting out of hand with a child, take a step back and create space between you and the child. This breathing space is important for both of you, after which you can express your thoughts and establish boundaries when you are collected, rather than channeling your concerns through frustration.\n Your example will be helpful to your children throughout their life. They will also have learned to make wise choices by the choices you allowed them to make. Now they will be kind to their children and teach them to make wise choices.\n It can be very hard to be patient sometimes in a world where teaching Mozart in the womb and expectations of exemplary behavior from preschool are considered the norm. No matter what the competitive approach insists upon, patience gives you a means for remaining calm within yourself, to give you the perspective to recognize the readiness of a child at their own developmental pace, independent of external standards. Rushing can cause you to lose sight of your guiding role, and of the precious essence of the child.\n Sometimes our greatest impatience arises when we allow our own endeavors such as work, personal pursuits, hobbies, sports, etc., to get in the way of spending time with children. Whether we're parenting, caring, teaching, working or volunteering with children, nobody is immune from impatience at times. If you feel any sense of resentment when being around children for \"holding up\" the things you want to do, or you find yourself \"half present\" instead of giving your full attention, then being patient can restore your joy of spending time with children. Let go of the impatience and realize that time spent with children is precious. It is a time during which you can learn a great deal about seeing the world through fresh eyes. It can also be a time when you realize that you can make a big difference in the life of a child by teaching or showing them something new, and by helping them to love and respect themselves all the more.\n\n\nRecognize that patience is a form of kindness. Giving time is giving kindness a chance. By removing the pressure of the other \"more pressing\" things you feel, you show your child that there is nothing more important, nothing kinder, than spending time with them.\nA child who is given time with an adult soaks up the message that the busyness of adult life can wait, that childhood is a good time, and that there is no need to grow up too quickly. The point of life is being with one another, a gift that can only be imparted to a child in the doing.\n\n"}

A sub division of physical abuse is domestic abuse, which is when a spouse is responsible for physical abuse. Signs of physical abuse include:\n\n\nBruises and injuries\nBroken bones\nDislocations, sprains, or fractures\nScrapes on any part of the body\nBurns from cigarettes, hot water, or appliances\nUnexplained or suspicious injuries\nA change in behavior towards others\nDiffering explanations of how injuries occured, Since elders can be weaker than others, they may be the target of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse is when any elderly person is subjected to unwanted sexual contact of any kind, from groping to intercourse, especially when he or she does not have the mental capacity to consent. Although the majority of sexually abused elders are women, it can happen to men as well.\n\n\nSigns include physical pain, tenderness, or bleeding from the genital or anal region, bruises on the inner thighs or genitalia, clothing that is torn, bloody, or stained, and difficulty walking or sitting when there was no previous issue., The elderly may be subjected to psychological abuse. This type of abuse is the intentional and willful infliction of mental or emotional duress or anguish through humiliation, threats, or other verbal means. Common indicators of psychological abuse include:\n\n\nDepression\nUncharacteristic confusion\nProblems sleeping\nBeing emotionally withdrawn, upset, irritable, or non responsive\nSigns that can be attributed to dementia, such as rocking or biting\nUnexplained weight loss or weight gain\nUnexplained stress symptoms, such as high blood pressure, Financial elder abuse covers any activity that takes the money or resources from an elder under questionable circumstances. This includes taking money or property, forging a signature to gain resources, using property or possessions without permission, taking money for services not given, and scams or cons of any nature. Signs include:\n\n\nUnpaid bills\nWithdrawals from accounts that can't be explained, which may be frequent\nNew legal documents\nMissing property\nSuspicious signatures on legal or bank documents\nImplausible explanations of elderly finances by the caregiver or family, Neglect is when caregivers neglect to fulfill their responsibilities to provide adequate care. This can be active neglect, which is when they purposefully withhold care from the elderly person and may be motivated by financial gain or personal conflicts. It can also be passive neglect, which is when the caregiver does not have adequate knowledge, resources, ability, health, or maturity to be the proper caregiver anymore. Signs of this include:\n\n\nLack of necessities such as food, water, and heat\nInadequate living arrangements, such as poor ventilation, lack of utilities, unsafe wiring, and improper ventilation\nInfestations of animals or insects\nMedical mismanagement, including out of date, empty, or unmarked prescriptions\nPresence of bedsores, skin rashes, or other preventable skin ailments\nImproper hygiene\nDehydration\nAbsence of necessary aids, such as glasses, walkers, dentures, hearing aids, or braces\nUntreated medical conditions, such as infections, soiled bandages, and unattended sprains or fractures"}

There are 2 types of grout for regrouting tile: sanded and non sanded. If your grout joints are larger than 1/8 inch (.3175 cm) use sanded grout to fill in the space; if your joints are going to be less than 1/8 inch (.3175 cm) use non sanded grout to fill in your joints as it is more compact.;\n, If necessary, remove the existing grout before preparing to lay down new grout. This will keep the appearance clean and even, as well as prevent mold contamination. (Tools for this include a utility knife, a ceramic chisel, a hammer and for caulk removal from the facing of the tile use vice grips with a utility knife blade set in like a scraper), Apply a tile sealant over the surface of your tiles if they have become porous so the grout does not sink underneath the surface when regrouting your tile. Do this by using a tile sponge, a roller, or simply wipe the tiles with a coat of sealant and allow to dry for 24 hours.\n Mix the grout in one of the 5 gallon (19 L) buckets using your margin trowel.\n\n\nA margin trowel is a small, hand-held tool used in masonry for laying pasty materials on tile, counter tops, and flooring.\n Apply a generous amount of grout to your grout joints along your tile floor using the rubber grout float. Be sure to distribute extra grout into the grout joints in order to fill them completely. Grout all areas of your tile floor except the expansion joints; these are the areas between the floor tile and bathtub, wall, door, and cabinet or sink area.\n\n\nThe rubber grout float is a rectangular, flat tool with a steel handle and rubber surface used to distribute grout. Hold the rubber grout float at a 30 degree angle and distribute grout across the surface of the tile floor.\n Remove the excess grout from the tile floor once every grout joint has been filled. Do this by going over the tile with the rubber grout float, only this time use it at a sharp angle and move it diagonally across the tile floor in order to scrap the excess grouting material off.\n\n\nMoving diagonally avoids detaching recently laid grout from the grout joints.\n Let grout set for approximately 10 minutes. While the grout is setting, fill your second 5 gallon (19 L) bucket with water and grab your tile sponge in order to clean the tile floor.\n Dip the tile sponge in the bucket of water and wring out any excess water leaving a damp tile sponge.\n Wipe all grout residue off of the tile using the damp tile sponge in a diagonal motion. Clean the excess grout from the expansion areas using the margin trowel to leave those areas completely clean for caulking.\n Rinse tile sponge and repeat the previous step until all of the grout residue is removed and tile is completely clean of grout haze.\n Allow grout to cure for 24 to 48 hours before stepping on it to ensure its stability and that it is completely dry.\n Caulk the expansion joints using a caulk color that matches your grout. Completely fill these expansion joints then smooth and concave using your finger.\n Apply a penetrating sealer using either a sponge or spray bottle to the grout joints once the grout has completely cured. Wipe off excess sealer from the tile immediately as it will stain the tile.\n\n"}

You won't be able to reinvent yourself if you're stuck in the same old thinking patterns. While you may have many healthy thinking patterns, you could always improve some of the aspects of your thinking as you move forward in your journey. Here are some great places to start:\n\n\n\nThink more positively. If you find yourself often picturing the worst thing that could happen in any scenario, thinking that everyone is mad at you because you've made a mistake, or convinced that nothing you do can improve your life, then it's time to make a concerted effort to be a more positive thinker every single day. Start by pinning down your negative thoughts and practicing positive responses to assure you that you're going down the right path.\nImprove your thinking about the future. Many people are filled with anxiety and dread when they think of the future -- but not you! At least, not anymore. Make sure that any thoughts of the future, however uncertain, put you in a happy and excited place.\nImprove the way you think about yourself. Gain confidence and learn to love the person you really are, how you look, and what you do. Without confidence, you won't have the ability to change.\nImprove the way you view your situation in life. Learn to be more grateful for the things you do have instead of focusing on the things you want.\n Though you may think you're a model mother, significant other, or friend, there is always room for improvement. If you want to reinvent yourself, it's time to change the way that you interact with others -- whether it's the mailman or your husband of thirty years. Here are some things you can do:\n\n\nBe a better friend. Take the time to listen to your friends more, to help them with their problems, and to do little favors that will light up your friends' days. Work on being less selfish and more caring toward your friends.\nBe a better significant other. Take the time to be more romantic and more adventurous, and to tell your loved one how you really feel every single day.\nBe a better employee. Whether you're the boss, or working on the ground floor, take the time to get to know your coworkers and to be kind and helpful.\nBe a better citizen. Take the time to be generous and to volunteer in your community, whether it's to teach children how to read at your local library, or to clean up your community park every Saturday.\n Unless you're a complete health guru, it's likely that you can take some steps to improve your overall health. Improving your body will lead to major improvements in your mind, and you will be better equipped to deal with daily problems and will feel more positive and energetic along the way. Here are some great ways to improve your health:\n\n\nFind a new exercise routine. Take a yoga, salsa dancing, or karate class, and fall in love with the new activity as well as its health benefits.\nTake time for a few 20-minute walks a few times a week. Taking walks will not only improve your health, but it will give you time to reflect on your new vision for your future.\nBe a healthy eater. Learn to eat three balanced meals a day, filled with healthy carbs, lean proteins, and plenty of fruits and vegetables.\nDo whatever you can to reduce stress in your life -- this will have numerous health benefits. Take the time to unwind for half an hour before you go to bed, minimize your extra commitments, reduce caffeine intake, and try to eliminate as many stress-causing factors in your life as you can.\n\n"}

Other materials to use for textured pathways include mulch and sand.If you have steps from your front or back doors, place floor mats at the bottom and top of the stairs for your dog. Putting non-slip strips on the stairs would also be a good idea.\n A pool or fishing pond are major safety hazards for a blind dog. The dog could fall into the water and not know how to get back out. If you have a pool or fishing pond, put a fence around that area.If you are unable to make the fence yourself, consider hiring a company that can install the fence for you.\n Branches at your dog\u2019s eye level could injure your dog\u2019s eyes or scratch its skin. Identify and trim back any branches that could injure your dog., Although your blind dog can learn to navigate its environment pretty well, walking your dog on a leash or harness is essential to keeping it safe when it\u2019s outside.If you use a leash, use a short leash to prevent your dog from tripping over it.A harness will put less pressure on your dog\u2019s neck., When your dog is blind, it will not be able to pick up on another dog\u2019s body language.This could be dangerous if the other dog becomes aggressive (showing teeth, lunging).When you walk your dog, put an \u2018I\u2019m blind\u2019 bandana around its neck so other dog owners will know your dog is blind."}

But, if you don\u2019t, then take as many history classes as you can. Vary your classes so that they cover a wide variety of topics and time periods. Take classes that require you to write substantial research papers.\n\n\nMake sure to take a handful of your history classes with the same professors so that they will get to know you well and be able to write strong recommendation letters for you. On that note, it is also best to start taking history courses early in your undergraduate career. Don\u2019t wait until junior year, if possible.\nMany Ph.D, programs also admit M.A. graduates as well.\nWhether at the undergraduate or M.A. level, try to publish prior to applying for a Ph.D. program. It may be difficult to find an publication venue, so encyclopedias are often a good option. Ask your professors for publication advice and assistance.;\n, You need to have a general idea of what areas of history intrigue you upon entering a Ph.D. program. Prior to applying reflect on what you enjoy learning about the most. Consider what types of historical questions intrigue you and which ones bore you. You also need to be very clear that history in general is the graduate subject for you.Don\u2019t go overboard on specifics. While some people come in to graduate programs with a dissertation topic in hand, that is not necessary. You will spend a good deal of your first year exploring various topics in consultation with your advising professors.\n Take a moment to look online and you will discover that the job market for Ph.D.s in history is extraordinarily competitive. There are many Ph.D.s graduating and not many of them will land full-time tenure track positions. Be realistic about whether you would be okay taking an adjunct or part-time teaching position for a period of time. Start to think about other career options as well.With a history Ph.D. a wide variety of jobs beyond academia are available to you. Some use their writing skills in the private sector as editors. Others work in historic preservation. Some find places in museums or in other educational outreach organizations.\n All of your professors attended graduate school at one time or another and, odds are, they\u2019ve stayed in touch with their universities and programs. Make an appointment with your history professors to solicit their advice on applying and on your program choices. Come to this meeting prepared with your curriculum vitae or resume, your test scores, and a potential writing sample.\n\n\nIf one of your undergraduate professors offers to reach out to a graduate professor or program for you, let them do it. Nothing beats having a professional connection built in advance of your application.\nRemember, however, that your professor\u2019s opinions are just opinions. If you are set on a particular school, be sure to check it out before dismissing it outright.\n Start by going online to find programs that are strong in your particular area of historical interest. Certain programs specialize in particular types or categories of history. Then, narrow it down depending on location, financial aid packages available, size of the program, etc.\n\n\nSpend a good amount of time on each department\u2019s website. They usually give a program profile that will tell you how many students are currently enrolled, how many are accepted each year, and how many faculty are involved. They usually also contain previews or complete lists of courses offered.Given the competitiveness of the current job market, pay particular attention to any information regarding the placement of graduates. Many programs will post placements rates and/or provide lists of recent graduates and their positions.Two examples of departmental specialization are Rutgers University, which has a very strong women\u2019s and gender history element, and University of New Mexico, which emphasizes the study of the American West. The points of emphasis can and do change so make sure to look for recent information as you research., Most departmental websites will list faculty names and contact information, usually alongside their specialties, publications, courses taught, etc. Once you\u2019ve narrowed down your list to around 15 schools, reach out to these professors via email. This is best to do before you submit your application so that you can develop a potential ally on the admissions committee.Make sure to reach out, in particular, to the faculty member who you are considering working with. Graduate school, unlike undergraduate studies, is very focused on the mentor relationship. You are essentially applying to the university, the program, and the faculty members in your area of interest.You might introduce yourself in the emailing by stating, \u201cDear Professor Stevens, I\u2019m Michael Smith, a junior currently enrolled at the University of Alabama, and I plan to apply to your doctoral program for the fall of 2017.\u201d Go on to tell them what interests you about their work in particular and the program in general.\nDon\u2019t be surprised if they put you in contact with a few current graduate students. These are great contacts to ask about housing, the culture on campus, etc., At least two weeks prior to the deadline mail or e-submit all of your completed application materials. Most programs require that you send in the application fee, a letter of intent, a writing sample, three letters of reference, and GRE or other test scores. Some schools require more or less documentation, especially if you are applying for assistantships.Be aware that students entering a doctoral program with a M.A. in hand may need to submit additional documents. They may also be able to move into an accelerated graduation path, perhaps \u2018skipping\u2019 a few hours of coursework., You will start to receive acceptance or rejection letters mid-spring and then you will need to make your final admission decision. Some schools will invite you to come visit their campus. If they pay for it or you can afford to do so, this is always a good idea. Talk to the faculty or graduate students again if that might help as well.This is also the time to carefully consider your financial situation. Your admission offer may come with funding in the form of an assistantship or fellowship. Look over the details and be realistic about what you want and need. Be aware that while some programs offer full funding it is often still well below real standard living costs (i.e. $18,000/year in an urban environment)."}

This is done before sanding to eliminate the possibility of impressing any foreign particles into the metal and contaminating your work. Using a bleached cloth maintains as close to a sterile environment as possible, which will lead to a better-finished product.\n If you are working with any metal that has an exterior and interior side, you will always hammer the interior side. So remove any parts that may be blocking access to the interior side. Place a hard material against the exterior surface and hammer out the dent, pressing against the hard material. Move slowly and work around the dent's perimeter towards the center.Once the dent is hammered out, place your hard material on the interior side. Then lightly hammer the area surrounding your dent to remove any peaks in the metal.\n Sanding is the least complicated method of removing chrome and therefore a favorite. Although chrome can be difficult to remove it's best to start with a grit less than 160 to remove a majority of the particles.Afterwards you can use 320 grit sandpaper to remove any marks left by the first round, and give a smoother finish.\n\n\nNote that with sanding it is important to be careful and use an equal amount of time and pressure over the entire surface to ensure an even result. This will create an ideal surface where the paint will stick more easily, and course texture won't show through the paint.\n If sandpaper is not cutting it, many professionals' next choice is a blasting gun. These tools use pressurized air to send tiny particles (usually plastic beads, ground-up walnut shells, glass beads, and aluminum oxide) to strip paint from base material, as well as smoothing out very durable metals.In order to contain the mess of media blasters, it is recommended to use a blasting cabinet. This will decrease the size of your work space, but also maintains cleanliness.\nIn addition to the PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) already in use, it is safest to use some form of ear protection with media blasters as they create a loud noise and could cause hearing damage/problems.\n Spray down the parts with wax and grease remover. It is easiest to use an atomizer bottle to coat all surfaces. Use clean, bleached rags to wipe everything off.\n\n"}

You can quickly drink:Cream of broccoli soup\nTomato soup\nChili\nGazpacho\n\n, For example, instead of grabbing a coffee and doughnut as you walk out the door, drink low-fat milk and eat a whole-grain fruit muffin. To keep you feeling fuller, add a little protein like yogurt, cheese, or a nut butter.Avoid simply filling up on sugary or fatty snacks as hunger strikes throughout the day. You'll be able to manage nausea better if you constantly have a little food in your stomach.\n Convenience foods can be a great option as long as you look for minimally processed foods. Many shops carry sliced fruits or vegetables that you can easily dunk into a nut butter spread or hummus. You can even find hard-boiled eggs that are easy to take on the go.Skip frozen meals, foods that are being kept warm under a heat lamp, or foods that are packed full of refined sugars and fats.\n\n"}

This will help you see violence before it happens, and give you time to prepare a response should you need one. It will also make any adrenaline work in your favor, rather than causing you to freeze.\n\n\nKeep your periphery active while your eyes move around. Your periphery is the outer boundary of your vision, the stuff you indirectly see when staring at things. Keep this periphery active. It'll help you anticipate obstacles while you still have time.;\n, If you believe that a person or party is intent on attack by the time you decide to exit, attempt to do so without causing them alarm. Attackers are more likely to rush you if they think you are actively fleeing.\n\n\nSwallow your pride \u2014 mild altercations can quickly escalate into serious harm because both parties could not control their egos or did not know their limitations. Going to the hospital with a broken nose might not be worth the \"cred\" that you get for staying in a losing battle.\n This is the negotiation phase of the fight. Talk to your assailant and try to get him to step down or see the value of making truce. If you've got the gift of gab, here's where you can use it. Keep your guard up while you negotiate.\n\n\nSay something like: \"I'll fight you, but I'd honestly rather not. Let's just calm down and try to fix this like adults.\"\n\nOr try something like: \"I really don't want to hurt you. I have nothing to prove. You can try hitting me if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it.\"\n\n\n, Raise your hands up, palms out, at neck level, and angle your body away from the aggressor. This accomplishes three things: it controls the vital distance between you and the aggressor (acting as a \"fence\"), it covers your head and vital organs, and appears non-aggressive. Always stay moving somewhat, but never backwards.\n\n\nProtect your face with your hands. Look at a picture of a boxer whose gloves are covering his face; this is where you want your hands, unless you are delivering a punch.\nKeep your legs spread apart and your knees slightly bent. This will give you more balance. You don't want your assailant to be able to knock you over.\nWhen you're not talking, keep your mouth closed. A well-placed hit to an open mouth can break your jaw.\n (e.g. \"What's the problem? How can I help?\") The best way to win a fight is to not let it happen in the first place. \"Calm down buddy\" and \"Take it easy\" can increase tension.\n\n\nPassifying dialogue has several positive effects:\n\nIt affords the aggressor non-violent options.\nIt may lower the aggressor's guard or cause them to underestimate you.\nIt establishes your position on the fight.\nIt illicits a choice on the behalf of the aggressor which will buy you time.\n When the adrenaline is really pumping in your assailant, the attack is most likely imminent. Most people will not back down from an attack once their adrenalin has surged, be prepared to be hit no matter what they seem to be doing.\n\n\nSigns that your assailant's adrenal response is in full force:\n\nMonosyllabic speech or grunting\nExcessive swearing\nSplaying of the arms\nFurrowed eyebrows\nDropping the chin\nFace goes white\nBaring teeth\n\n\n\n, It may sound strange, but it works. Deliver your fiercest war cry in a fit of fury. This serves two purposes. For one, you'll intimidate your assailant if your grunts are really fierce and violent; second, you'll draw more attention to the fight, making it easier to end it.\n To strike you, the aggressor must get past your fence. 95%+ of the time, they will attempt a strike to the head, usually with a right hook. (Most people are right-handed.) If you know that your assailant is left-handed, be on guard for a left hook to the face or body.\n\n\nUse your fence as a tripwire. If your assailant touches it once, line up for a pre-emptive strike. Strike on the second touch, in a place where they are vulnerable.\nDo not wait for your opponent to correct themselves or escalate their attempts. If they even touch you once, brace yourself for counterattack the next time they attempt contact.\n You could very easily break the small bones in your hands, or even collapse your knuckles. Aim for their nose and lips to minimize that risk.\n If they are strong, chances are they can also punch very hard. It can take just one well-placed punch to take someone out.\n\n\nDodging is the key. Stay on your toes and dance around like a boxer. If your assailant doesn't know in what direction you'll be going, he'll have a harder time punching you or getting you down on the ground.\nAfter dodging a punch, they will be off guard for a split second. This is the time to hit them. Soft spots are extremely useful. The nose, face, kidneys, temples, and throat are all good places for a punch. This may temporarily incapacitate him (especially the throat, but it could collapse their windpipe). Kicks to the side of the femur are also effective. You can throw him off balance long enough to catch him in the jaw with a punch or kick.\n Unless you fly like a butterfly and sting like a bee, you'll probably be hit at least one or two times during the fight. Knowing how to take a hit will help you last longer and be able to take harder hits.\n\n\nHow to take a hit in the face. Keep your mouth closed, clench your neck and jaw muscle, and move toward the punch. Moving toward the punch (unless it's a straight-on punch) could cause the assailant to mishit, giving you an opportunity to strike back. If you can, try to get your assailant to aim for your hard forehead, which will hurt his hands.\nHow to take a hit to the body. Tighten your stomach muscles without sucking in lots of air. Try to move around the punch so that it hits you on the sides (obliques) rather than dead on in the stomach or against any organs.\n Fist and hand techniques are the most viable option. Look at the jaw before you strike it. This not only gives you the chance to disable your opponent, but even a strong failed attempt can force an attacker to reconsider further efforts.\n\n\nIf he's leaving his stomach unguarded, try to go for a gut punch in order to knock the wind out of him. If you succeed in knocking the wind out of him, the fight is effectively done.\n A knee drop to the chest is also very effective, but realize that it places you in close proximity to any attacks of theirs. Do not kick to the head, as it is easily fatal.\n If your punching technique is strong enough and you have mentally disarmed the attacker via your dialogue and \"fence,\" he will be knocked out or at very least disorientated. Use this time to escape if you can. If your strike did not have this effect, he will still be caught off-guard. Continue forcing him back with strikes to the chin, jaw and neck, until they are unable or unwilling to fight.\n\n"}

One way to hold her is in your lap. When she is resting comfortably in your lap, place one of your forearms across her body to keep her in place.The length of her body should be against your abdomen.\n\n\nYou can sit wherever is most comfortable for you\u2014couch, chair, bed, etc.\nThe forearm across her body should be your non-dominant arm. For example, if you are right-handed, your left forearm should lie across her body.\nIf you think she is going to scratch, wrap her in a towel so that only her head is sticking out.If you would like to sit on the floor but holding your cat in your lap won\u2019t work, try positioning her such that she is in between your knees and unable to get away.;\n, It may be easier and more comfortable for you to have your cat on a surface that is about at your waist level. If the surface is a little slippery, place a towel down first so your cat has some traction under her. You can also wrap her in a towel.\n\n\nIt may take some trial and error to determine whether holding your cat in your lap or restraining her on a table will work best.\n To give your cat eye drops, you will need to hold her head steady with your non-dominant hand. Place the thumb of this hand on one side of her jaw and your fingers on the other side. In effect, her head should be cradled firmly in your hand, with your hand under her chin.Gently, tilt her head upward to make it easier to give the eye drops., For the eye drops to be most effective, your cat\u2019s eyes will need to be free of discharge. If necessary, clean your cat\u2019s eyes by putting a small amount of sterile eyewash solution on a cotton ball and wiping around her eyes.Along with the eye drops, your veterinarian would already have recommended an eyewash solution to clean your cat\u2019s eyes.\n Use the thumb of your non-dominant hand to pull down your cat\u2019s lower eyelid. This will create a small pouch into which you can administer the eye drops.Although convenient, it is not necessary for the drops to go into the pouch. The drops will disperse quickly across your cat\u2019s eye,so you do not have to worry about placing the drops in a particular spot on her eye.\n Hold the applicator tip about two centimeters (one inch) above your cat\u2019s eye. It is very important that you not touch your cat\u2019s eye with the tip.Not only would this be irritating to your cat, but it would also contaminate the tip.\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like, aim the tip towards the pouch you created with your thumb.It may help to rest the heel of your dominant hand on top of your cat\u2019s head. This will allow you to have a steady aim of the drops and prevent you from accidentally touching your cat\u2019s eye with the applicator tip.Place the bottle cap to the side on a clean surface., Squeeze the bottle and quickly dispense the prescribed number of eye drops into your cat\u2019s eye.Be careful not to dispense more than the prescribed amount.\n\n\nIf both of her eyes need to be treated, repeat the same procedure to put drops in the other eye.\nIf your cat seems restless and refuses to be still, consider trying again later when she is more calm. You do not want her moving around so much that you can\u2019t get the drops into her eye.\n Even if your cat was a willing participant in getting the eye drops, she probably will not want to stay still after you\u2019ve finished giving her the drops. In fact, she may want to start rubbing at her eyes. It is important that you keep her restrained gently until the drops have a chance to disperse over her eyes., You may think that massaging your cat\u2019s eyes will help spread the eye drops across the eyes.However, the drops will disperse quickly on their own.Your cat may enjoy having an eye massage after getting the drops, but it is not necessary from a medical standpoint.\n A good way to distract your cat after giving her the eye drops is to give her something tasty to eat. Your cat would love a scrumptious treat,like a small piece of tuna, after the perceived indignity of receiving eye drops. You could also time the eye drop administration with mealtime so that you could reward her with a meal afterwards.You will probably need to give your cat eye drops several times a day, so be judicious with your treats. You do not want her to fill up on treats each time you administer the drops.\n Usually, eye drops are not uncomfortable for cats. If anything, your cat will blink a lot after the drops hit her eyes. However, if the drops are bothersome, she may paw at her eyes or even try to rub her face across the floor. Contact your veterinarian if your cat becomes extremely bothered after getting the eye drops.\n\n"}

These are sometimes accessed from the bottom and need to be removed for service.\nMost BMW and Mercedes Benz batteries and a few others are located in the trunk, concealed in an isolated compartment.\nBatteries may also be located under the rear seat, such as in some Cadillacs.;\n, Before you check the water levels, clean any dirt or debris from the top of the battery and around the battery terminals. This is important, as you do not want any foreign material entering the battery cells when you open them. This is also important because a clean battery surface helps slow or stop corrosion on nearby metal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor general cleaning of road grime and minor corrosion, use an ammonia-based window cleaner. Spray the cleaner on your rag \u2014 not on the battery itself \u2014 and wipe away any dirt. Paper towels can be used as long as you replace them before they disintegrate to bits.\nHeavy corrosion can be cleaned with a paste of baking soda and water. Again, wet the rag and wipe, do not soak the battery with baking soda. Sometimes it takes many repetitions of wetting the rag and wiping. Follow up by cleaning with a rag dampened with window cleaner to remove the baking soda. Leaving a residue of baking soda on the exterior of the battery will speed up future corrosion of the terminals and nearby metal.\nDon't get ahead of yourself here \u2014 be sure the covers are on the battery ports at this stage of cleaning. Do not let cleaning fluids drip or flow into the battery through the ports.\n\n\nNote: If you prefer, you can remove the battery from the car before cleaning and performing this maintenance, and reinstall it afterwards. This may be safer, especially if the battery is in an awkward location. This will reset some or all of the electronics in the car however (clock, radio station presets, etc.). If the battery can be serviced without removing it from the car, this usually saves considerable time overall.\nYou can also remove the battery terminals from the battery and dip them in a cup of very hot water. The hot water will melt away the corrosion, leaving a clean surface. Make sure you the terminals are completely dry before replacing them on the battery.\n On top of the battery are typically two semi-rectangular plastic covers used to seal each battery cell port. These can be removed by gently prying with plastic putty knife or a screwdriver. Try prying from a number of points around the periphery of the cover if the cover does not immediately come loose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome batteries have six individual round covers instead. These can be removed by twisting counter-clockwise, and then lifting them out.\nIf the battery is labeled as \"maintenance free,\" it is not designed to be opened. Manufacturers advise that water cannot be added to these batteries, they simply need to be replaced if they stop working well.\n Removing the port covers may reveal more dirt on the top of the battery. Continue cleaning by wiping away from the ports with a rag dampened with window cleaner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not use baking soda for this cleaning. Use a small amount of window cleaner, and be very careful to prevent anything (cleaner, dirt, bits of paper towel, etc.) from entering the ports.\nDon't be tempted to skip this step \u2014 keeping the top of the battery clean will reduce future corrosion. This is an important aspect of battery maintenance for preserving the integrity of the connections.\n By looking down into each port you can see the electrolyte level of each individual cell. Each cell is supposed to be covered in an equal amount of fluid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is not the case it could have been caused simply by accidental overfilling previously, in which case the problem is easily corrected by proper filling later, after the overfilled level has gone down in normal service to the normal range.\nIf fluid levels are obviously unequal, it is also possible that the battery may have a small fluid leak or a cracked case. If so the battery needs to be replaced. If there is no obvious leakage, fill the battery to the maximum safe level, using distilled water only, and check again in a few weeks to see if the levels have remained uniform.\n The electrolyte is too low if any part of the plates is exposed to air. If the plates are not fully covered with electrolyte, then the battery cannot operate at full capacity.\n\n\nExposing the plates to air ruins the area exposed to air in a matter of days.\nIf the electrolyte is only about 1/2 inch (1 cm) below the top of the plates, adding enough water to the battery to just cover the plates may return it to serviceable condition at a slightly reduced capacity. (Instructions for adding water follow in Part 3 of this wiki article.) Otherwise, you will need to consider replacing the battery.\nA low electrolyte level could be caused by overcharging, so if this is the case, you should consider having your alternator checked.\n The normal fluid level is about 1/2 inch (1 cm) above the tops of the plates or about 1/8 inch (3 mm) below the bottoms of the filler tubes that extend down from the port openings.\n\n\nIf this is the case it may not be worth the effort to fill the battery at this time. Just replace the port covers and inspect again in three months.\n The maximum safe fluid level is just touching the bottom of the filler tubes.\n\n\nMost filler tubes have a pair of slots in the side somewhere near the bottom of the tube. This causes the meniscus (the little bit of liquid that bends up near the edge of the tube) to have a distinctive eye-shape if the fluid is touching the filler tube, whereas there is no meniscus if the fluid is below the bottom of the filler tube.\nThe eye-shaped meniscus is designed as a signal to stop filling. You may need to use a flashlight to see the fluid level and the presence or absence of the meniscus clearly.\n You should always follow the advice of your battery dealer or the battery manufacturer if it conflicts with the information provided in this article.\n\n\nAlso be aware that batteries for golf carts, floor cleaning machines, and nickel cadmium batteries especially may require other electrolyte levels.\n Distilled water can be purchased at most grocery stores. If the electrolyte levels in the cells are low (plates are exposed), fill each cell to just cover the plates. Then use a battery charger to recharge the battery, or just drive the car for a few days in normal service. Only fill to the maximum safe level \u2014 just touching the bottoms of the filler tubes \u2014 if the battery is fully charged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a clean funnel, sports bottle, turkey baster, etc. to ensure control of the flow and accuracy of the final level when filling each port. Be very careful to prevent any dirt or cleaning agents from getting into the cells.\nUsing tap water, well water, filtered water, or anything but distilled water, will introduce minerals and chemicals (e.g. chlorine if it is city water) and other contaminates that will result in decreased battery life., If you are adding water because the battery is weak or dead, it is better to fill it just enough to cover the plates (or leave it alone if it is at a normal level).\n\n\nWhen a weak or dead battery is charged the electrolyte level will rise, therefore you should allow space for the level to rise when you charge the battery. (This does not happen to a fully charged battery.)\nElectrolyte levels can also rise if the battery gets hot.\n Ensure all areas are clean and free from dirt or debris, then place cleaned port covers back onto the battery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you accidentally overfilled the battery but there is no overflow onto the top surface of the battery, the best thing to do is just to stop filling and let it be. If there was an overflow onto the top of the battery, remember that the overflow is acidic \u2014 do not let it touch your skin or clothing.\nClean it with a rag or with paper towels by wiping away from the ports. Do not let the rag or paper towels get wet enough to drip on other parts of the car or anything. Rinse the rag or paper towel in a pail of water. Wear gloves\u2014don't get the water on your hands.\nAfter the job is done, discard the rinsed-out rag or paper towel in the regular trash. Pour the water down a drain, being careful not to splash the water around. You do not want to take a chance that the residue of acid will get on something else. Finally, clean anything that the overflow contacted with a rag dampened with window cleaner.\nVisually inspect any overfilled battery weekly for a month to see if there is any further overflow, and clean any overflow as described above if necessary.\nThe sulfuric acid lost from the battery by an accidental overflow is probably a small enough amount as to be immaterial to the operation of the battery. It is best not to attempt to add acid to to replace the loss. (Too much acid shortens the life of the battery more than too little.)\n\n, The electrolyte in the battery is sulfuric acid, so it is extremely important that none of this liquid gets into your eyes, as it could cause significant damage or even blindness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact lenses afford you no protection and may complicate an accident. Ordinary glasses do not protect adequately due to the lack of side shields.\nTherefore, it's essential to wear safety goggles, which can be purchased at most hardware stores.\n Choose a glove-type that can stand up to sulfuric acid for at least a few minutes. These can be found at hardware stores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatex and vinyl gloves will not stand up to acid long. If you use latex or vinyl gloves, change the glove immediately upon noticing a splash on it. Given time, a splash of electrolyte will soak through the glove and burn your skin.\nNeoprene gloves offer protection for an hour or more, but are harder to find at ordinary hardware stores. Nitrile is not the same as Neoprene. Nitrile gloves offer less protection from sulfuric acid than latex, and should not be used.\n Wear old clothing with long sleeves, long pants, and closed toe shoes to cover as much skin as possible. If any electrolyte splashes on your clothing the fabric will rot away in about a week or two, leaving a hole, so wear old clothes that you can sacrifice.\n If any electrolyte splashes on your skin, immediately wash it with running water and soap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you feel a burning or tingling sensation on your skin anywhere, you may have splashed a drop of electrolyte on yourself. It only takes a drop to cause a burn.\nYou may not be able to see any redness or injury until it is too late, so if you suspect you may have splashed yourself, take a break from your work and wash immediately rather than taking a chance.\nDispose of all used gloves and rags when the job is done. Leaving these in contact with other materials could cause damage.\n\n"}

The steps in this section will help you to match your face and body shapes to your dress style.\n This means that you can choose any type of neckline you like.\n\n\nIf you have a round face (as wide as it is long, a little narrower at the forehead and jawline), you should look for a prom dress that elongates your face to make her look more oval. V-necks, Queen Anne and Empire necklines, sweetheart and scoop necks suit best your oval face. Always avoid high neck dresses and supersized necklaces, as they tend to hide the neck and therefore make your face look even more round.\nIf you have a triangle face (wide jaw line, narrow forehead), look for necklines with a stronger vertical shape that can add curves to your face: Sabrina necklines, scoop necks, sweetheart necklines and cowl necks.\nIf you have a heart shaped face (sharp and oval chin, slightly prominent cheekbones, wide forehead), you need to make your face look wider, so opt for necklines that draw a horizontal line near the neck: high or wide necklines.\nIf you have a square face (square jaw line, forehead, cheekbones and jaw having the same width), the perfect prom dress for you should have a vertical shape, so look for scoop necks, Sabrina, sweetheart, cowl neck styles, and always avoid square necklines.\nIf you have an oblong face (prominent chin, forehead, cheekbones and jawline having the same width), look for prom dresses with necklines that can make your face look wider and more oval: round, wide, Sabrina and cowl necks. Also, stay away from V-neckline dresses.\n You could be an apple, pear, hourglass, vase. There are various different categories for body shape and you can find your body shape by reading: How to determine your body shape. To match the body shape and dress, here are some suggestions:\n\n\nIf you have an hourglass body shape (well-defined waist, torso and hips having about the same width), look for prom dresses that accentuate the waist and keep a perfect balance between tops and bottoms: if they have sleeves, a full skirt is required; if the top of the dress is tight, the skirt must also tightly follow the hips and thighs.\nIf you have a rectangle body shape (no defined waistline, shoulders, bust and hips having the same width), you need to define your waist and add volume on both your upper and lower body. The best prom dresses for you are draped dresses with a defined waist and full skirt, Empire dresses, A-lines and any dress with a full skirt, ruffles and folds.\nIf you have an inverted triangle body shape (little waist definition, shoulders and bust larger than the hips), you must add volume to your lower body in order to draw attention away from your broad shoulders. You can create the hourglass silhouette illusion by wearing Empire line dresses, A-lines with deep V-necks, wrap dresses with a higher waist and other dresses with full skirts and details or embellishment on the hips.\nIf you have a pear body shape (torso and upper body smaller than the hips), you must make your silhouette look like the ideal hourglass figure, so look for prom dresses that draw attention to your shoulders and bust and reduce your lower body: A-line dresses, wrap and draped bust dresses, as well as prom dresses with well-defined waist and embellishments that draw attention to your upper body.\nIf you have an apple body shape (little or no waist definition, upper body wider than the hips), you need dresses that can create the illusion of a slimmer waist while keeping the right balance between the upper and lower body: Empire and A-line dresses with simple tops and a low and wide neckline (scoop, square, sweetheart).\n\n"}

Your individual calorie needs will vary based on age, gender, height, and activity level. There are online calculators you can use to determine the amount of calories you should be consuming each day.The minimum number of calories you should eat a day is 1200. Do not go below this level without medical supervision.\nYou can also figure out how much you should be eating by scheduling a consultation with a dietitian or a physician to discuss your weight loss goals, special dietary needs, current eating habits, and potential areas for improvement.\nDevelop a meal plan. Choose meals that have a healthy balance of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, good fats, and lean proteins. A typical dinner plate should be filled with half vegetables or fruits, half whole grains and lean protein.\nThe DASH diet, the TLC diet, the Mayo Clinic Diet, the Weight Watchers diet and Volumetrics all provide great meal plans to help you lose weight starting today. Run an internet search on any of the diets and meal plans to find out more.The more weight you have to lose, the quicker you will lose those first few pounds. That said, if you only have 10-20 pounds to lose, you will need to be patient and consistent with your workouts and diet over a longer period of time to see results.\n Eating balanced meals will not only provide you with low-calorie nutrition, it will also help to suppress your appetite so you won't overeat and foil your plans to lose weight. There are certain foods that keep you feeling sated for hours. Try incorporating the following foods into your diet:\n\n\nGrapefruit\nOatmeal\nApples\nEggs\nGinger\nNuts\nLeafy greens\nPotatoes\nDark chocolate\nSpicy foods\n\n, Write down every meal, snack, and drink you consume as well as the approximate quantities for an entire week. Writing down what you consume actually helps us to remain mindful of what we put into our bodies and acts as a motivator to stay healthy. If you can, write down the number of calories that go along with each meal or snack you eat.\n\n\nDon\u2019t forget to include coffee mix-ins, condiments, and other additions to your daily diet.\n Food triggers are the activities we do that make us want to snack. For some people, it's sitting down to watch a movie at night; for others, it's studying late at night. If you know your food triggers, you can plan for them--fill your house with healthy snacks or have them on hand.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t purchase the unhealthy foods that you love to snack on, you will be less likely to sabotage your diet.\n Incorporate appropriate portion sizes into your meal plan.\nStronger flavors can help you control portion size. For example, dark chocolate or a dark beer are satisfying in small amounts, but difficult to consume rapidly.\nFor instance, a healthy snack of almonds and dried cranberries can turn into a huge calorie source if you don\u2019t pay attention to quantities. Also, preparing pre-apportioned healthy snacks can help you avoid mindless overeating and can make it convenient to grab a healthy snack.Make a list of what you'll need for these meals, and don't stray from your list when you get to the grocery store. Looking at market circulars can also give you ideas and even cut costs by buying weekly sale items and seasonal produce.\n Eating a healthy breakfast increases your resting metabolic rate earlier in the day, keeps your energy levels high, and may help you resist the urge of high-calorie snacks throughout the day. Plan to eat a small snack or meal every two to four hours to keep your metabolism active. Eating regularly also keeps your blood sugar stable and reduces unhealthy calorie binges or deviations from your meal plan.\n Avoid the areas in the grocery store that stock sodas, cookies, ice cream, pizzas, and other fattening and highly processed foods, so that you are less likely to purchase unhealthy options. If you can\u2019t see them, you can\u2019t be tempted by them.\n Most foods have healthier counterparts that will allow you to enjoy your favorite foods without unnecessary fat, sugar, and calories. Exchanging high-calorie processed foods and drinks for healthier alternatives can help you lose weight faster.\n\n\nConsider eating vegetarian a few days each week. By replacing meat with nutritious foods like beans, tofu, or lentils, you can cut significant amounts of your daily calorie intake while adding many nutrients to your diet.\nEat delicious fruit for dessert rather than a processed cookie or cake.\nSwap potato chips and candy bars for snacks that are nutrient-rich and low in calories and fat. Try combining string cheese with a handful of grapes, spreading peanut butter on a few crackers, or dipping sliced red pepper into a few tablespoons of hummus.\nTry substituting vinegar and lemon juice for your ranch or blue cheese dressing.\nCook with a tablespoon of olive oil instead of butter. It has the same number of calories, but it is a healthier type of fat.\n Sip on water, tea, black coffee or seltzer instead of soft drinks, juice energy drinks, flavored coffees, and martinis. Cutting calories with substitutions can be a lot easier than you might think. For example, a tall latte in the morning may pack 500 calories. Since a pound of body fat (lost or gained) is roughly equivalent to 3,500 calories, replacing that rich beverage with black coffee can help you lose a pound per week.\n\n\nDrinking water instead of soda, coffee, alcohol, juice, or milk may help you cut hundreds of calories per day. Increasing your water intake can also help your body efficiently use nutrients, keep you energized, get the most benefit from your exercise routine, and feel full longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can handle substituting water for all other drinks for a week, you can expect faster weight loss and see dramatic improvement in energy levels and even appearance very quickly.\n\n"}

Don\u2019t take these experiences to heart. If you\u2019re struggling to feel positive about yourself, start by making a list of your positive qualities. This can help you see the great things about yourself and remind you of who you are.Your list can include physical traits (such as, \u201cMy favorite part of my body is my hair\u201d), characteristics (such as, \u201cI am kind, generous, and compassionate\u201d), and your social qualities (such as, \u201cI enjoy making other people feel good and laugh\u201d). You can also practice ways to raise your self-esteem.;\n, Negative thoughts can perpetuate feelings of anxiety, depression, and thoughts that things are bad and will never improve. Find ways to stay positive about making changes and feeling good about yourself. Create goals instead of dwelling on negatives, and put things in perspective.For example, ask yourself how you\u2019ve grown or matured as a result of your experiences, or if you\u2019re able to relate to people better due to your own experiences. If you\u2019ve experienced discrimination for being a minority, you might relate to other minorities differently.\nIf you feel like things will never change and you\u2019ll always feel hopeless, think back to other difficult times when bad things improved for you., Part of being empowered is knowing that you can make a difference. Create some goals around issues of discrimination that matter to you. For example, if you want to make a difference on a personal level, respond to discriminatory comments. If you want to make a difference on a larger scale, organize a group to fight discrimination on your college campus. This can help you feel confident in yourself and your abilities by knowing that you\u2019re making an impact.Face your fears and overcome them. For example, stand up for someone and show that you\u2019re on their side or talk about discrimination during class.\n Know who you can go to for support around issues of discrimination. Find a friend who will listen to you and support you in your struggles. You don\u2019t have to spend lots of time talking about discrimination, just knowing a friend is there and willing to listen is often enough.Have people you know you can talk to and be with comfortably.\nMeet in-person instead of texting or calling on the phone.\n If discrimination causes you to feel sad, anxious, invalidated and affects your self-worth, a therapist can help. Your therapist can validate and support your experiences and feelings. You can learn coping skills to manage the effects of discrimination.Therapy can help you learn assertiveness skills and help to increase feelings of empowerment.\n A support group is a place you can meet with other people who also share similar struggles. You can safely share your thoughts and experiences in this group without worrying about judgment or ridicule. Most importantly, you will realize that you are not alone in your struggles. If you\u2019re looking to meet like-minded people with similar experiences or desires for change, a support group can be a great place.Give and receive advice, share resources, and talk about how to make changes.\nFind a support group by calling your local mental health clinic, university counseling center, or by doing an internet search.\n Schools and universities often have policies against discrimination and bullying. If something happens on your school or university campus, report it. If you\u2019re in primary or secondary school, report the discrimination to a higher authority, such as a dean, principal, or disciplinary office. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funding prohibit discrimination.For example, discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, disability, and age are prohibited. You can report it at http://www.ed.gov/ocr/complaintprocess.html\n\n\n, Laws within many countries prohibit discrimination in the workplace. For example, in the USA, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the laws and regulations.If you experience discrimination, report it to your manager, human resources department, or the regulating governmental authority.\n\n\nExamples of discrimination in the workplace that are prohibited include age, disability, pregnancy, race/color, religion, sex, and national origin., If you want to take legal action, your first step is to file a police report. When submitting a report, make sure it is in writing and not just talked about or discussed. Go to your local police department to file the report. Discuss as much as you can about the incident: when it happened, who perpetrated, what was said or done, and how it was handled. Be clear in expressing what was wrong and how it affected you.Have a clear case and if possible, prove the discrimination. If there\u2019s any doubt, people may question your allegations, which can make any formal proceedings more difficult.\n If you feel like you\u2019re being discriminated against, speak up. If you know someone else is experiencing discrimination or suspect it happening around you, say something. Let people know that you care and want to help them, and resolve to be a positive force in your community against discrimination.Let people know that you will stand up for them if they\u2019re experiencing discrimination.\n Advocacy groups exist to help raise awareness, safeguard rights, express concerns and find solutions.You can propose changes in policy, ask for increased inclusion, and take steps to make all people involved feel comfortable. Find an advocacy group that will help you make a difference. For example, join a women\u2019s center, LGBT safe space, or diversity group and advocate for what\u2019s needed. It can be helpful to meet with other like-minded people who also want to make a difference.\n\n\nFind ways to make a difference in the workplace, school or university, community, or local government. Do an internet search to find an advocacy group near you or join a national group.\n If you\u2019re struggling with issues around discrimination, don\u2019t hold your feelings in or hope that they will go away. Find a healthy outlet for your emotions so that you feel safe to acknowledge and express your experiences and feelings around them. Try journaling, playing or listening to music, dancing, or painting. Focus on letting your feelings out and not bottling them up.Find activities that help you clear your mind and feel better after you\u2019ve completed them.\n Find some healthy outlets for stress, such as relaxation. Practice every day to keep your stress levels low and deal with accumulated stress.Find an activity that feels restful, relaxing, and calming and that you can realistically do every day. You might want to try daily yoga, qi gong, tai chi, and meditation.\n\n\nPracticing relaxation for 30 minutes each day can help keep depression away and can help stabilize your moods.\n Even simple tasks like getting enough sleep and eating nutritious meals can ensure that you feel your best and help you feel good emotionally.Fuel your body and help yourself feel good.

Check with your state or program to see if you qualify by participating.\n Only one Lifeline Program discount, that is one telephone line either wireless or landline, is allowed per household. The Lifeline Program provides a simple questionnaire to determine who qualifies under your household. If someone in your household already has an Obama Phone, you will need to discuss which one of you will get or keep the benefit., The Lifeline Program has a list of companies that participate, organized by state. Select your state to see the companies and plans available. Take a look at several companies and plans so you can select the plan that best suits your needs.Your phone should come with voice mail, call waiting, caller ID, and in most cases at least 250 minutes per month. All companies will offer the ability to send and receive text messages, though how many depends on the plan you select., Once you have chosen your company and plan, contact the company directly and ask for an application. You will need to include your name, address, date of birth, and last 4 digits of either your Social Security number or Tribal Identification number.You will also need to show proof that you are eligible for the program. If you are eligible based on being in an assistance program, you will need to provide a copy of your benefit card or statement. If you are eligible based on income, you need to provide documentation, which can include:\n\nCurrent income statement from an employer\nPrior year\u2019s state, federal, or Tribal tax return\nA Social Security statement of benefits\nA Veterans Administration statement of benefits\nA retirement or pension statement of benefits\nAn Unemployment or Workers\u2019 Compensation statement of benefits\nA federal or Tribal notice letter of participation in General Assistance\nA divorce decree\nA child support award\nOther official document containing income information\n\n\nObama Phone programs are done directly through phone companies, and not the federal government, so there is no government contact for getting a phone.\n In most cases, providing your eligibility information will be enough for the phone company to prove your identity and get your discount. If not, though, the company will contact you and ask for additional documentation verifying your identity. If you cannot provide this documentation to prove who you are, you will be denied. Documents the phone company may ask for include:Driver's license (unexpired)\nBirth certificate\nW-2\nPrior year's state, federal, or Tribal tax return\nSocial Security card\nCertificate of Naturalization\nCertificate of U.S. Citizenship\nPermanent resident card (unexpired)\nPermanent resident alien card (unexpired)\nU.S. government, military, state, or Tribal issued ID (unexpired)\nPassport (unexpired)\nMilitary discharge documentation\nWeapons permit (unexpired)\nGovernment assistance program document (that includes proof of identity)\nStatement of benefits from a qualifying program (that includes proof of identity)\nUnemployment or Worker's compensation statement of benefits\n\n, Once your application is approved, your company will sign you up for the program. If they are sending you a cellphone, your benefits begin once you receive the phone. If you are applying these benefits to an existing phone line, ask the company when exactly the discount will begin., Once you get your phone, you need to use it to stay in the program. If you do not use your cellphone at least once every 60 days, you will receive a notice from the company. That notice will give you 30 days to start using your phone, or else your discount will end. Remember the point of the program is to help people who need phones to use., If you decide you would rather have a different plan, you can change the company giving you the Obama Phone discount. Contact the new company and ask for a transfer. You may transfer no more than once every 60 days (about 2 months). This isn\u2019t something you should do often, and if you do you are stuck with your company for at least that amount of time.When you contact the company, they will need certain information from you. This includes your name, address, phone number, date of birth, and the last 4 digits of your Social Security number. You will also need to give verbal or written consent that you know you will be losing your benefits with the previous company, and that the company has explained that you may not have more than one benefit per household.\n Each year, you will receive a notice to recertify your eligibility. This notice will include instructions and give a deadline for recertifying. This will usually involve proving that you still have a low income or are on a government assistance program. If you fail to recertify, you will lose the discount, which means your phone bill may increase, or you will not receive your free minutes., If you no longer receive support from a government assistance program, or your income has increased above the limit, you may lose your discount.

Though rare, hazards like drowning are, tragically, no joke. Below are bare minimum equipment recommendations \u2014 contact your local outdoors authority (like, for instance, a park ranger's office) for specific information regarding the area you plan on canoeing in. Also see the \"Things You'll .\n\n\nIn addition, you'll want to be at least a reasonably competent swimmer, as capsizing (having the canoe flip over) can be a frequent problem for beginners.;\n, Your very first time you climb into a canoe, you're likely to immediately notice that balancing is difficult and that every small movement seems to shift the boat more than expected. To counteract this rocky feeling, stay as low as possible \u2014 you can even sit or kneel in the bottom of the boat until you feel more stable. Most canoes' seats should provide fine balance as long as you aren't moving around or standing up. If you are paddling by yourself, sit in the back (stern) with your gear at the front (bow) so that you'll be able to steer the boat. If you don't have much gear, you may find it easier to balance by sitting in the center.\n\n\nTry to sit up as straight as possible in your seat. Keeping your body perpendicular to the surface of the water (usually, this means straight up and down) gives you the stablest balance.Don't worry! The boat will be more stable when paddle/s are in the water, as the resistance from the moving water helps to keep the boat upright.\n Seated securely in the boat, grab a paddle with both hands.\n\n\nPut one hand on top of the end of the handle (there should usually be a rounded portion here; if there isn't, grip the handle near the top.) This will be referred to as your boat-side hand.\n\nUse your other hand to grab a lower point on the handle that's comfortable for you. Usually, this will be at least a foot or so above the flat part of the paddle \u2014 gripping right next to the flat part isn't advised as it forces you to work harder. Turn your hand so that your lower palm is facing toward the boat. This will be referred to as your water-side hand.\n It's time to begin your stroke! Start by twisting at the torso so that your water-side shoulder shifts forward. Move the paddle forward (out of the water), then plant it in the water so that the blade of the paddle (but not much of the handle) is submerged. Keep the shaft of the paddle as close to vertical as possible for greater strength.Don't forget your body position as you paddle. You want to reach as far ahead as you can without moving from your seat or leaning too far forward. This will put you off-balance.\n Turn the blade of the paddle so that it is perpendicular to the boat (and the direction of travel.) Use your arm and core muscles to pull the paddle through the water in a straight line parallel to the centerline of the boat.\n\n\nTry to keep the paddle close to the boat as you make your stroke (some sources even recommend keeping the inside edge of the paddle touching the canoe). Having a wider stroke can inadvertently make the boat turn.Muscle discipline is important for efficient paddling. You want to be using mainly the core muscles of your body for power, not your back muscles, as using the latter can leave you sore and uncomfortable after your boating trip.\n Stop applying power to the paddle when the blade reaches your hip. Begin to bring the blade up and out of the water. Turn the paddle so the blade is parallel to the surface as you move it forward for the next stroke.\n\n\nYou are now back at your starting position! Simply repeat the steps above to continue paddling \u2014 the canoe should gather momentum and move forward at a good speed. However, if you paddle only on one side of the boat, you'll start going in circles. See below for information on cross-paddling.\n If you've ever seen someone paddle in a canoe, you've probably noticed that she will pull the paddle out of the water every few strokes and start paddling on the opposite side. This is to keep the canoe going in a straight line \u2014 paddle on only one side and you'll notice yourself start to turn to the side opposite your paddle. To cross, pull the paddle out of the water when it is at your hip. Lift it perpendicular to the boat and bring it across while switching the position of the top and bottom hands \u2014 this should feel natural. Insert it into the water and paddle as before.\n\n\nTry practicing this a few times to get a feel for the \"rhythm\" of when to switch sides. For most, switching after every few strokes is best \u2014 the exact number will vary depending on your paddling form and how hard your strokes are.\nIf you're paddling tandem (i.e., with two people in the canoe), you'll want to coordinate the switch with your partner. See below for information on paddling with a partner.\n The simplest way to turn a canoe is probably the most intuitive \u2014 assuming you are sitting in the stern (rear) or center of the canoe, simply paddle as you normally would on one side to eventually start turning in the opposite direction. That is, to turn left, paddle on the right side, and to turn right, paddle on the left side. You should notice the course of the boat change slightly with each stroke.This method is great for gentle corrections in course because, while it doesn't turn the boat quickly, it doesn't slow you down either. For instance, if you see a sandbar jutting out of the water 100 meters ahead, it's probably appropriate to use this turning style to get around it \u2014 you're in no hurry.\n While canoeing, you'll eventually find that, while paddling on one side of the boat is an effective way of steering in many situations, there are plenty of times when quicker turns are required. One of the simplest ways to turn is called a J stroke. To use this technique, you'll ideally want to be sitting in the stern of the boat.To do a J stroke, put your paddle into the water behind you so that it is nearly flat against the side of the boat, which it should be almost touching. As you do this, twist your torso so that your shoulders point parallel with the sides of the boat. Use your core and torso muscles to turn back to a forward-facing position \u2014 this should make the paddle turn out to the side a little and the boat should turn to the same side as the paddle is on, just like if you were using a rudder.\nAvoid over-using this stroke. While it will make you turn quickly, it will also slow down your forward momentum.\n The J stroke discussed above is actually just a smaller version of a special paddle technique called a \"back sweep.\" By increasing the size of the back sweep, you'll increase the speed at which you turn. However, larger back sweeps will also make you slow down more, so you'll want to reserve them for situations when you need them or you'll have to paddle hard to build up speed again.\n\n\nTo do a back sweep, start out with your paddle behind you as you would for the J stroke. This time, as you straighten your torso, let the paddle swing out completely to the side \u2014 it should be perpendicular to the side of the boat when you finish the motion. You should immediately notice the boat turn to the same side as the paddle is on.\n Another technique for making sharp turns in your canoe is called the \"draw.\" This technique is effective, but since its form is different from any of the other strokes', it can be more awkward to execute while moving unless you're an experienced paddler. Try testing it out at slow speeds before using it in a serious situation.\n\n\nTo do a draw, plant your paddle in the water directly out to your side. Your arms should be as straight as possible, the paddle should be as vertical as you can keep it, and your boat-side arm should be over your head. Pull the paddle toward the boat until it touches or is very near to it, keeping its blade parallel to the side of the canoe as you do so. Assuming you are sitting in the stern, the canoe should turn to the side opposite the paddle.Remove the paddle from the water by slicing it backward out of the water without changing the orientation of the blade. From here, you can transition easily into a standard forward stroke or a J stroke.\n Paddling in tandem (with a partner) is similar to paddling on your own, with some crucial differences. When two people are sitting in the same boat, it's important to keep the boat \"trim\" \u2014 that is, to make sure it sits balanced in the water. Thus, you'll want one person sitting at the bow (front) of the boat and the other at the stern (back). This should be the sitting arrangement that feels most natural and balanced.\n\n\nIf one person is significantly heavier than the other, you may want to consider putting more of your gear at this person's end of the canoe to evenly distribute the weight.\nIn traditional canoe terms, the person sitting at the bow is called the bowman and the person at the stern is called the sternman.\n When paddling as a team, you want to synchronize your strokes (start and finish them at the same time) to get maximum power. Since the bowman is facing forward and can't see the sternman, the bowman sets the pace. This means it is up to the stern man to match his strokes to the bowman's, not the other way around. Of course, both paddlers can (and should) talk to each other to figure out a comfortable pace \u2014 good communication is key for a quick, happy voyage.\n The person sitting in the stern of the boat will almost always have an easier time determining the direction of the boat than the person in front. Thus, the sternman is responsible for making sure the boat is going in the right direction. She should use her normal strokes as well as special techniques like J strokes and sweeps to keep the boat pointed forward. The bowman may assist in turns, but will not usually be able to take a leading role.The reason that the sternman has greater control over the boat's steering has to do with the force of resistance the water puts on the boat. Essentially, since the bow of the boat is responsible for \"cutting\" through the water, it is constantly feeling the resistance of the water that it pushes out of the way. The stern, on the other hand, doesn't have this problem, so it usually feels less of a \"push\" from the water around it, making it easier to turn.\n When traveling forward, having both people paddle on opposite sides of the canoe generally gives the straightest result. To make sure you don't accidentally start paddling on the same side of the boat and cause it to turn, make sure to switch sides at the same time. Generally, the sternman calls out \"switch!\" when it is time to do so.\n\n\nNote that, since the sternman has greater control over the direction of the boat, the canoe will usually gradually turn away from the side the sternman is paddling on even if the bowman is paddling on the opposite side \u2014 this is why switching sides is important.\n With the addition of a second paddler, steering a canoe becomes slightly different. While all of the stern man's steering techniques described in the section above will work as normal, the bowman's efforts to steer can work differently because of his position at the front of the boat. If the bowman understands these differences, he can assist with the steering of the boat. Below is a summary of techniques the bowman can use to help steer:\n\n\nPaddling forward works normally (the boat will turn away from the bowman's paddle.)\nDraws work backwards (the boat will turn towards the bowman's paddle.)Instead of doing back sweeps, bowman usually use a technique called the front sweep to help steer. This is essentially the opposite of a back sweep \u2014 the bowman reaches forward with the paddle, then pulls it back and out to the side in a wide arc along the surface of the water. This works like a stronger version of the ordinary forward stroke, turning the boat away from the bowman's paddle.\n\n"}

The cornea may degrade and the eye may swell. Clouding of the eye may become permanent as well as any other visual defects in the eye. , As soon as your eyes are exposed to HF, flush them with large amounts of cool, running water for at least thirty minutes. This will flush out the acid and help prevent continued damage to the eyes. If only one eye has been contaminated, be sure to not wash acid into the other eye. Keep your eyelids apart and away from the eyeballs while washing.\n\n\nTilt your head to the side so that water runs off your eye from the side closest to your nose towards your temples. This will prevent the contaminated water from rinsing back into your eye, nose, mouth, or other vital areas on the face. , Once you wash your eyes out, seek medical attention immediately. Ideally, you should see an eye specialist so he or she will know the best way to treat you. This cannot be reiterated enough. HF is a highly reactive substance and can cause severe damage, visual defects, and blindness.\n On your way to the emergency room, you should apply an ice pack to your eyes. Applying an ice pack to the affected area may lessen the effects of the HF, while also helping to alleviate the painful symptoms., Once you get to the emergency room or eye doctor, he or she will assess the damage in order to limit the long-term effects to your eyes. You will most likely continue to receive flushing of the eye, as well as topical tetracaine ointment and a 1% calcium gluconate flush.\n\n\nThe goal of immediate treatment is to reduce your pain, neutralize the effects of burns, and then to assess and come up with a treatment plan based on the outcome.\n Prior to discharge, your doctor will assess your electrolyte balances with a blood test, test for any heart palpitations and arrhythmias, and review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to make sure it is normal.\n\n\nYour doctor may continue with similar tests during any follow-up to make sure that long-term symptoms do not develop after you have been discharged.

Dry dentures will help the paste adhesive to stay attached to the dentures, and to your gums.This will ensure a very stable bite and will prevent food from getting underneath your dentures.\n Do not use more denture adhesive than directed on the label. Always begin with a small amount of adhesive so you don\u2019t put too much on your dentures.Apply three to four dabs of the paste the size of a pencil eraser to the upper denture, equally distributing the paste on the inside surface. Do not apply the paste too close to the edge of your denture.\n The dabs should be no bigger than a pencil eraser and should not be too close to the edge of your denture. Again, make sure the dabs are evenly spaced along the inside surface of the denture., If any of the adhesive oozes out on the sides of the dentures, you have used too much adhesive. You may need to remove the dentures, clean off the adhesive and reapply, using less on the upper and lower dentures., If you put the adhesive on your dentures properly, you should not need to reapply the adhesive throughout the day.A standard 40 g tube of adhesive should last at least four weeks, a 47 g tube should last five weeks, and a 70 g tube should last at least eight weeks. Avoid overusing the denture adhesive or using too much every day.\n\n"}

Those catfish farmers who plan to harvest catfish of only a certain minimum size generally do not drain down the level of their ponds.;\n, Seines are large nets used to scoop the catfish out of the ponds they were raised in. A standard seine to harvest catfish runs a length of 1,000 to 1,400 feet (300 to 420 meters) and has a depth of either 6, 9, or 12 feet (1.8, 2.7, or 3.6 m). The seine mesh size ranges from 3/4 to 2 inches (1.8 to 5 cm), which allows catfish weighing less than 1 to 2 pounds (2.2 to 4.4 kg) to slip through so they can grow to a harvestable size.\n\n\nThe seines are framed with half-inch (1.25-cm) rope at the top and bottom. The top rope is laced with floats at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) square spaced at every third tie. The bottom rope features 2-ounce (5.7 g) weights spaced at every second tie.\nThe mesh ropes are covered with plastic- or petroleum-based materials to prevent the spine in the catfish's dorsal fin from getting caught in the net.\n The catfish seine is wound onto a large hydraulic reel. The truck- or tractor-driven reel can reel the seine in or let it out as necessary when harvesting the catfish.\n\n\nIn smaller ponds, the seine can be pulled by hand, and so a seine reel is not needed.\n Starting at the deep end keeps the larger catfish from escaping into deep water as the seine is trawled through the pond. If the shallow end is deep enough to accommodate the seine, however, it can be drawn through the pond from the shallows to the deep end.\n\n\nIn larger ponds, the seine is drawn off the seine reel using another truck or tractor on the opposite side of the catfish pond from the tractor holding the seine reel. A boat with a push rack comes in behind the seine to keep it from bogging down in mud at the bottom of the pond.\n This will gather the larger catfish into the net while letting undersized fish slip through. The harvesting area is created when the 2 tractors reach the opposite end of the pond and start converging to close the net around the catfish, which may number from 50,000 to 100,000, depending on the pond's size and catfish population, and how large the mesh is.\n\n\nIn some ponds, a basin-like area is dug out specifically for harvesting the catfish.\n, The live car, or harvest sock, is a collecting mesh into which the catfish are shunted through a funnel in the seine. It measures 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 m) wide by 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 m) long and is designed to hold 50,000 to 100,000 pounds (22.7 to 45.4 tonnes) of fish at a density of 20 pounds per cubic foot (320.4 kg per cubic meter). As with the seine, the live car has floats along the top to keep it above the water and to keep fish from escaping into the water.\n\n\nAs with the seine, the live car's mesh size is designed to separate out larger from smaller fish. The mesh size used varies according to the minimum size of fish required by the processing plant to which the harvested catfish will be shipped.\n As the seine is pulled slowly and evenly on either side, the harvested catfish are drawn into the live car. Workers keep the top of the seine from going underwater, which would let fish escape.\n If the weather is hot or if the water has been muddied from the seining, the live car can be pulled into clear water and staked in place. An aerator is connected to the live car to keep the fish alive until they can be loaded onto a truck.\n Some catfish farmers repeat the seining process until about 80 percent of the fish have been seined. They then drain the pond and continue seining until all the fish are removed. Catfish farmers who harvest only catfish of a certain minimum size do not repeatedly drain and seine.\n Known as grading, this process segregates the larger, more profitable fish from the smaller, less profitable fish. Fish are herded into loading baskets with a dip net or another piece of mesh designed to separate fish by size.\n Catfish are transported in trucks equipped with live wells, where they are killed and skinned. Some are filleted, and some of the fillets are cut into nugget-sized pieces.\n\n"}

The triangles alternate in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. There are four types of quadrants: the player's home board and outer board, and the opponent's home board and outer board. The intersection of these four quadrants, the middle of the board, is separated by a ridge called the bar.The players sit facing each other at opposite sides of the board when they play. Each player's home board is positioned on the right quadrant closest to the player. The home boards are opposite each other, and so are the outer boards, which are located in the left quadrant.\nThe player moves his checkers from the direction of the other player's home board in a horse-shoe like direction, moving counterclockwise.\nThe triangles are numbered from 1-24 in most of the Backgammon boards, with the 24th point being the furthest point from the player, and with 1 being the right most triangle on the player's home court. The players must move their pieces from opposite sides of the board, so one player's 1st point is the other player's 24th point, one player's 2nd point is the other player's 23rd point, and so on.;\n, Each player must set up his 15 checkers for the game to begin. The players' checkers will be comprised of two distinct colors, traditionally white and red, or white and black but it can also be other colors. To set up the board, each player must place two checkers on their 24 point, three checkers on his 8 point, five checkers on his 13 point, and five more checkers on his 6 point.Remember that each player has his own numbering system, so the checkers will not overlap.\n The player who rolls the highest number will go first. If both players roll the same number, roll again. The numbers rolled will count as the first moves for the player with the highest number. For example, if one player rolled a 5 and the other rolled a 2, then the player who rolled the 5 would go first and use the 5 and 2 in lieu of a new dice roll., In backgammon, the winner doesn't gain points, but the loser loses points. So if you win, the opponent will either lose based on the face value, double value, or triple value of the stakes on the doubling cube. The doubling cube isn't a die but a marker. It starts at 1, but you can raise the stakes at any time at the beginning of your turn before you have rolled the dice.If you want to double the stakes and your partner accepts, then the cube is turned to the new number and placed in your opponent's court. He will have ownership of the cube and will be able to propose a doubling during any of his future turns.\nIf your opponent does not accept your offer, he must forfeit the game and lose by the original stakes.\nYou can keep doubling the stakes back and forth, or redoubling, but it's not traditionally done more than three or four times in a game.\n Use a dice tumbler to roll two six-sided dice once during each of your turns. The numbers rolled represent two separate moves. For example, if you roll a 3 and a 5, you can move one checker three spaces and another checker 5 spaces. Or, you can move one checker 3 spaces and then 5 more spaces.Make sure that you roll the dice to the right of your side of the board, from a reasonable height so that they bounce and roll a bit.\nIf either of the dice lands on a checker, outside of the board, or leaning against the edge of the board, then it is not considered valid and you will have to reroll.\n An open point is any point on the board that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers. You can move your checkers to a point with no checkers on it, a point with one or more of your checkers on it, or a point with one of your opponent's checkers on it. Remember that you should always move your checkers counter-clockwise, moving from your opponent's home court to your own.You can start with any checker you chose, but it is a good idea to get your checkers out of your opponent\u2019s home board as soon as possible.\nYou only need 2 checkers to block a point, but you can have as many of your checkers as you want on a single point.\nRemember that you can either move one checker twice or move two checkers once. For example, if you roll a 3-2, you can move one checker 3 points over and then 2 points over, as long as it lands on an open point both times. Alternately, you can move one checker 2 points over to an open point, and move another checker 3 points over to an open point.\n If you roll the same number on both dice, then you've earned yourself two extra moves. If you roll double 3s, for example, then you can make four moves of 3 points each.Again, you can move four checkers 3 times, move one checker 3 times if it lands on an open point after every move, or mix it up and move two checkers 6 times, or one checker 3 times and another checker 9 times. As long as the total moves add up to 12 and each move lands in an open point, you're in good shape.\n For example, if you roll a 5-6, but you can't find an open point when moving any checker either 5 or 6 times, then you lose your turn. If you can only play one of the numbers, then you can play that number and lose your turn on the other number. If you can only play one number or the other, then you have to play the higher number.This rule applies even if you roll doubles. If you can't play the doubled number you've rolled, you lose your turn.\n Try to avoid having just one of your checkers on a point because the point, which is called a blot, is vulnerable to being \u201chit\u201d by your player's checkers. If one of your checker\u2019s gets hit, then it will go to the bar and you will have to use your next turn to roll and try to reenter the board in your opponent\u2019s home board. Do your best to keep at least two of your checkers on a point, at least early in the game., Before you start moving your pieces into your home court, you should try to have many points occupied by 2 or 3 checkers instead of just a few points occupied by 5 or 6 checkers. This will not only give you more options to move to open points, but will also make it harder for your opponent to move to an open point., If you hit a blot, a point occupied by just one of your opponent's checkers, then the opponent's checkers will be placed on the bar. You should try to hit the blots whenever possible, as long as it helps you move your pieces as close to your home court as possible. This is a great way to slow down your opponent.Any time a player's checker is on the bar, he can't move his other checkers until he gets the bar checker back on the home board.\n If a player hits a blot with one of your pieces on it, then you have to place your own checker on your bar. Your task is now to move that checker back onto the opposing home board. You can do this by rolling the dice and then moving the checker onto an open point on your opponent's home board, if you roll an open number. If you do not roll an open number, then you lose your turn and you will have to try again on your next turn.For example, if you roll a 2, you can enter your piece on the 23 mark on your opponent's home court, provided that it's open. This is because you're moving your checker two points over from the bar.\nYou may not use the sum of the two numbers to choose a space. For example, if you roll a 6 and a 2, you cannot add them and move your piece onto the 8th point. You can only move your checker onto the 6th or the 2nd point to reenter.\n Once you get your checker(s) off the bar and back onto the board, you can move your other checkers again. If you only had one checker to enter, then you can use the other number that you rolled to move one of your other checkers.If you have two checkers on the bar, you have to enter them both before you can move any other checkers. If you can only enter one checker during a dice roll, then you will have to try again on your next turn.\nIf you have more than two checkers on the bar, you can only move your other checkers once all the checkers on the bar are entered.\n To win the game, you need to be the first one to bear off or remove all of your checkers from the board and into your tray. To bear off your checkers, you need to roll both dice and use the numbers to move pieces into the tray. The numbers you roll must be exact or higher than the number of spaces needed to remove each piece from the board.For example, if you roll a 6-2, you can bear off two pieces that are on these points. But if you do not have a checker on the 6 point, you can bear it off from the next highest point on your board, such as the 5th or 4th point.\n You can only start bearing off your checkers once they are all in your home court. To begin bearing off, get all of your checkers into the 1-6 points on your board. They can be placed on any of these points. Don't forget that your checkers are still vulnerable when they're in your own home court.If the opposing player has a checker on the bar, then he can still enter it into a blot on your court if you have any, forcing you to take out one of your pieces and move it all the way back to the 24th spot. After that, you can't continue bearing off until it's back in the home court.\n When bearing off, you can only bear off checkers that occupy the corresponding point. For example, if you rolled a 4-1, and you have a checker in the 4th and 1st point, you can bear them off. If your roll double sixes and have four checkers on the 6th point, you can bear off all six.If you still have a die to play and no checker to bear off, you must move a checker according to the number on the die. For example, if you only have two checkers remaining in the 6th and 5th points and you roll a 2-1, then you can move the checker on the 6th point over to the 4th point, and the checker on the 5th point over to the 4th point.\nYou can use a higher roll to bear off a die on a lower point. If you roll a 5-4 and you only have a few checkers remaining in the 3rd and 2nd points, you can bear off two of these checkers.\nYou must move a lower die roll before a higher one even if it means you can't fully use the full value of a die. For example, if you have a checker in the 5 point and roll a 5-1, you must first move the checker over 1 to the 4 point and then bear it off using the 5 value.\n If you bear off all fifteen of your checkers before your opponent does, then you have won the game of backgammon. But not all wins are created equal. Your opponent can lose in one of three ways:A regular loss. This happens if you bore off all of your checkers first while your opponent was trying to bear off his checkers. Your opponent will lose only the value on the doubling cube.\nThe gammon. If you bear off all of your checkers before your opponent bears off any of his, he is gammoned and loses twice the value on the doubling cube.\nThe backgammon. If you bore off all of your checkers while your opponent still has checkers on the bar or your home court, then your opponent is backgammon and loses three times the value on the doubling cube.\n Backgammon is meant to be played more than once, since each game is worth a certain amount of points. You can even set a goal to play until the losing player loses a certain amount of points.If you want to keep playing more games but can't do it in one sitting, you can keep a tally of the points lost by each player and return to the game at another time.\n\n"}

If not, consider putting in a small wind turbine on your own property. You'll need to check local planning laws about the permissibility of adding such a structure to your property.\n Wind energy is unpredictable. If you have a long period of no wind, you won't get any power at all from this energy source. Always have an alternative power source that you can rely on, or team this up with another green energy source.\n\n"}

Generally they pay the key money and will handle communications with your landlord if anything breaks. Often they will rent several units in one apartment house, so you\u2019ll have friendly faces just two doors down. Smaller schools sometimes don\u2019t offer accommodations because they prefer to hire from within Japan. Less risk and they simply don\u2019t want to fork out the key money. So you would have to find your own accommodations in Japan. No easy feat!;\n, Large ESL schools often won\u2019t have any flexibility in their curriculum. You will teach what you\u2019re told to teach. However,smaller ESL schools will often be more flexible with their curriculum (if they even have one). This can give you the chance to experiment with new ESL games, activities and texts.\n Large ESL schools tend to see their teachers as expendable. With their massive recruiting budget and connections, they can replace teachers in the blink of an eye. This results in a colder atmosphere and causes faster turnover in the staff, and long-term bonds never get made. However smaller ESL schools tend to treat the teacher as a part of their team and may value your opinions and input on various school functions. They also allow you to hangout with students after class \u2013 this helps build relationships and adds to the entire experience.\n Large school salaries will all be in the 250,000 yen a month range. Your large chain schools usually give some kind of bonus -whether it is a free ticket back or a completion bonus. Generally the raises will be very small. Smaller ESL schools often give a bit more in the salary category simply because some of them are so far out in the country that it\u2019s difficult to find teachers. Often it\u2019s easier to get raises (or bigger raises) and other perks from smaller ESL schools than the larger ones. They don\u2019t have such a well-oiled recruitment machine so it\u2019s tough and a big pain for them to replace teachers.\n\n"}

In fact, some doctors are hopeful about its potential to boost the number organ matches dramatically. If you don\u2019t already have an account, consider signing up and building a presence there.To sign up, go to Facebook\u2019s main page at www.facebook.com or search for Facebook on a search engine like Google.\nUnder the heading \u201cSign Up,\u201d enter your name, email address, password, birthday, and sex. The next steps will guide you through the creation of your personal page. Once finished, you can use this as the basis for your search and add friends, photos, and messages.\nYou can also try creating a non-personal page for your campaign. On the Facebook homepage, click the link that says \u201cCreate a Page for a celebrity, band, or business.\u201d Next, click the button that reads \u201cCause or Community,\u201d input the name of your drive, and hit \u201cget started.\u201d;\n, Once you\u2019ve set up a personal or community page and added friends, write a message to tell them that you are searching for an organ donor for a friend or loved one. Try to craft an announcement that gives the essential details and asks for help. Then, post the message or share it with your group of friends.\n\n\nSay something like, \u201cDear Friends, we want to let you know that X is very sick and needs a kidney. She is looking urgently for a donor with type B+ blood between the ages of 25 and 40. If you know a possible match, please contact us.\u201d\nYou can post such a message as a personal status update. You might also send it as a \u201cpersonal message\u201d to your entire group of friends for the widest possible readership. Also, ask your friends to share the message with whomever they can.\nOnce you\u2019ve announced the search, keep your friends updated. Post new messages from time to time to tell them how the search is going, if you\u2019re still looking for a donor, or if you\u2019ve found a match.\n As of 2012, Facebook offers users the option to update \u201corgan donor status\u201d on their personal profile. This was designed as a way to help boost the rate of organ donor registration and, at least at first, led thousands of people to sign up. Your own friends might not be aware of this tool, however. Encourage them to sign up.Consider posting a message about this under your personal status. Friends who are already registered to donate organs can update their profiles, but also make sure to include a link to sites where people can sign up for the first time.\nIf you\u2019re in the US, you should direct friends to the \u201cDonate Life America\u201d page and have them click the \u201cSign Up\u201d button. This will redirect them to the organization\u2019s website, where they can register as a potential donor for organs, eyes, or tissue.\n Another way you can broaden your social media presence is by joining public organ donation pages and groups on Facebook. There are a number of these community pages, like Organdonor.gov. You can also search Facebook for similar sites in your country or area. Join them to get connected to other people who share the same interests or are potential donors.To look for sites, go to the search option and type a key word like \u201corgan donation.\u201d You can narrow the search only to public pages and community groups by hitting these keywords on the list of options at the top of the page.\nSign up for these pages or join open community groups. Follow the pages and post about your own search to raise awareness.\n Twitter is another way that you can approach your search for an organ donor. Like Facebook, Twitter is a social media networking site that can connect you to hundreds or even thousands of people. It also allows you to send short messages of up to 140 characters, or \u201cTweets.\u201d Registered and unregistered people can read these tweets.To sign up for Twitter, go to www.twitter.com or search for Twitter on an internet search engine. Click on the button at the top of the page that says \u201cSign Up.\u201d Then, follow the instructions to open an account.\nTwitter is especially convenient because it can work through your mobile phone. By adding a phone number to your account, you\u2019ll be able to send and receive tweets via SMS text messaging.\nFrom a computer, login to your account and go to \u201cSettings\u201d on the drop-down profile icon. Click on the \u201cMobile\u201d tab, select your country, and then enter your mobile phone number. Click \u201cContinue\u201d and Twitter will send you a verification code to your phone number. Enter the code to activate your phone.\n Twitter is really useful when you pair it with other social media and can help you to spread the word about your organ donor search. If you link it your Facebook profile, you can share Facebook posts on Twitter or share Tweets with your Facebook friends. Then, for example, an update about the search that you send out as a Tweet will automatically appear on your Facebook feed.If you\u2019d like to link your accounts, go to www.facebook.com/twitter. Click \u201cLink to Twitter\u201d by your profile or by the page you want to link and follow the instructions.\nYou can also control the kinds of things that you share on Twitter. You can choose to limit if you\u2019d only like to share status updates on the search, but also choose to include things like photos, links, and info on events.\n You\u2019ll want to get your message out to friends and followers often to run the best and most thorough donor search. Find and follow others on Twitter to build up a network. Follow your Facebook friends if they have accounts and keep in touch using the Tweet function, sending things like news and updates.Learn to use hashtags. When you send out a Tweet, you can add a short label with the prefix #. This allows people to search for Tweets with a common topic. For example, you might add hashtags like \u201c#organdonors\u201d or \u201c#organdonation\u201d to Tweets on your search.\nThe internet group Organize captures all the information it can carrying hashtags about organ donation and puts it into a huge registry, as well. So far, they\u2019ve compiled the names of about 600,000 people who support organ donation and hope that this will boost donor rates.\n Before you jump head-first into a social media search, you should check to see that finding a donor online is legal and doable in your country. In some places, like Belgium, doctors have refused to transplant organs from online donors because this bypasses the official waitlist. In other places, however, the law is more relaxed.Look into relationship limitations. In some countries like Germany, you can only accept volunteer organ donations from people who are related to you either in the first or second degree or \u201cin a very special way.\u201d In Belgium, you must be in a \u201csustainable relationship\u201d with the donor.\nOn the other hand, in the US the laws are less strict about transplants between people who aren\u2019t biologically related. This means that a donation from a Facebook friend is theoretically OK.\nIf you aren\u2019t entirely sure that searching on social media is legal, talk to a lawyer before you start your campaign.\n One of the big problems of looking for organ donors off the official waitlist is that it encourages the black market sale of organs. Know that selling organs for money is against the law in most countries, including the US, where it is prohibited by the National Organ Transplant Act. You could get into big trouble if you accept an organ in exchange for payment.The ban on organ sales is supposed to make donation more equal. That way, the rich don\u2019t have an unfair advantage in getting access to needed transplants. People who break the US law face fines or even jail time.\nBe wary of any potential donors who ask for something in return. According to one study, about 3% of Facebook donation pages got offers to sell organs like kidneys, usually from people in Third World countries and especially south Asia.\n Legal or illegal, searching for an organ donor off the official waitlist raises some thorny ethical issues. In the end, you might find that you\u2019re OK with searching through social media and don\u2019t have any qualms. But you should at least give the issues some careful thought.Is it fair for you to bypass the waitlist, for example? Some people wait patiently for years to get an organ transplant and, in some countries, the wait lists try to prioritize those who have the greatest need.\nConsider also that searching for organs via social media privileges those who are able to present their story better or who are just more photogenic and media savvy. Are you OK with this, too?\nWhat about tech privilege? Many people who need organ transplants have limited or no access to social media. Is it fair for them to be put at a disadvantage in finding a donor?\n\n"}

Or will it be something you have as a treat once or twice a week? Think about what will work best for you. If you\u2019re not sure how much soda you want to cut out, use a calorie counter to figure out how much you are consuming. You will probably discover that you\u2019re taking in hundreds of empty calories in the form of soda., For some, it's about the sugary taste. For others, it's the caffeine rush. It's important to know what you are getting from soda so that you can figure out an alternative to help move you away from soda., If it's caffeine you like, coffee and tea are going to be better choices than soda. Investigate different coffee drinks (both hot and cold) and teas. There are many options beyond black coffee and black tea. You might want to tryIced tea\nFlavored black tea\nCold brew coffee\n\n, For many people, the sweetness and carbonation of soda are what make it most appealing.

Do that for one week and then decrease your intake again.Continue to lower the amount of soda that you drink until you have given it up completely.\n Hopefully you\u2019ve found some drink that\u2019s not soda that can be your daily drink -- coffee, tea, flavored water. Try to replace one of your servings of soda with your new drink and one serving of soda replaced by water. Do this for a week., Find out a combination that works for you -- water, some soda, some of your new drink -- and keep drinking less and less soda. This process might take a few weeks, or even a month. By doing it slowly, you\u2019re allowing your body to get used to the lower levels of soda it\u2019s taking in.\n Now that you have water and some other beverage to hydrate you and satisfy some of what soda gave you, hopefully you will be able to stop drinking soda. It might be difficult at first, but by working up to it slowly, your body has gotten used to progressively lower levels of soda., Just because soda is no longer as central to your diet doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t enjoy it occasionally. One serving of soda a week may be an acceptable amount.\n Don\u2019t let yourself fall back into bad habits because you\u2019re tired or wanting a sugar fix. If you are tempted by the vending machine at work, bring your own beverages. Keep water as your main beverage -- don\u2019t let yourself be sucked into craving your new beverage choice (coffee, tea, flavored water)., Even though you\u2019re not drinking soda, you can consume or do other things that can satisfy your cravings that are healthier. When you start to crave soda, do something enjoyable that can take the place of the soda craving. In addition to the drinks mentioned earlier, some options might be:\n\n\nChewing gum\nTaking a walk\nPlaying a game on video or smartphone\nTexting with a friend for support\n\n, Write down your reasons and keep them somewhere that you can look at regularly, such as on your refrigerator or on your phone lock-screen. When you feel a craving come on, look at your list and think about how you'll feel afterward.\n\nRemind yourself of the ways that soda can impact your health. Sugary sodas increase the risk for obesity, type II diabetes, osteoporosis, kidney stones, and heart disease.Sugary drinks are bad for your teeth.\nSoda is also expensive.\n Large quantities of soda typically keep you highly caffeinated. Even though the levels of caffeine in coffee are higher, if you have a serious soda habit you\u2019re probably drinking a lot of caffeine. Think carefully about how you\u2019re going to deal with the reduced caffeine. You\u2019re going to feel more tired and less alert than usual, and this could last weeks as your body adjusts., Serious caffeine withdrawal will typically involve a headache. Your body has been so used to the elevated levels of caffeine, it\u2019s going to take your body a while to adjust back to functioning normally without the high levels of caffeine. Try using over-the-counter headache remedies containing acetaminophen, which does not contain caffeine., Even though it\u2019s not caffeine, drinking water can help keep you full of (healthier) liquids. It can also help combat the caffeine headaches and get your body used to water as your drink of choice, rather than soda.\n Chances are, without caffeine you are going to feel much sleepier than usual. Go to bed earlier to get more sleep. Nap when you can. These extended periods of sleep can help you get through the withdrawal and alleviate the headaches."}

Make sure that the oval is oriented sideways, with the narrow ends facing left-and-right., Place the angel onto a foil-lined baking sheet, then place it into a pre-heated oven. Follow the baking temperatures on the package of clay you are using, but only bake it for half the recommended time. This will set the clay, and make it easier to add other details without smooshing the existing shapes. You will finish baking the angel after you add the other parts.Baking temperatures vary from brand to brand. Typically, they range between 215 and 325\u00b0F (102 and 163\u00b0C).You can bake the angel in a regular oven, a convection oven, or a toaster oven. Do not use a microwave, however., You can use an acrylic tube or a rolling pin to roll out the clay. This will eventually make the wings of your angel. If you'd like a fancier angel, use pearly-white clay instead., Start by cutting the sheet into a triangle, able the same size as the body cone. Cut the triangle in half. The short edges will make the inner part of the wings. The straight edges will make the bottom. The angled edges will make the top., The easiest way to do this would be to add vertical dents into the wings using a toothpick. Align the toothpick against the bottom of the wing, and angle the tip towards the top. This will create slight ripples in the wing. Space the dents 1 to 2 toothpick-thicknesses apart.For fancier wings: use a dotting tool or a ball-tipped embossing tool to draw short streaks into the wings.Consider adding a hint of shimmer by dusting on powdered eyeshadow with a soft, fluffy brush., Use a toothpick to add a glob of liquid clay onto the back of your angel. Press the wings into the liquid clay. Angle the wings so that they look like an M. Smooth out the seam between the two wings., Start by rolling two small balls of clay about the size of a pin head. Press each ball onto the sides of the angel's head, turning them into slight disks. Make them level with the dent, and position them closer to the face than to the back of the head., Use a clay tool, or another blunt-tipped tool, to blend in the front part of the ears towards the angel's face. Do not blend in the back of the ears., Choose some clay for your angel's hair. It can be yellow, brown, black, or even a surprising color, like pink or purple. Roll out your desired clay into a thin sheet. You can use an acrylic tube to do this, or simply press the clay between your fingers to make a \"pancake.\" Use a toothpick to draw streaks into the clay going widthwise., Be sure to cover the top of the head as well. Don't cover the face.Smooth the top of the sheet over the top of the head. If you'd like to, you can add a parting crease with a toothpick., Roll out thin coils of clay, then attach them to the front of the hairline. They can be as long and wispy as you'd like. For a more realistic effect, have all the smaller hair pieces come from the start of the part.\n\nConsider adding some streaks to the bangs before you attach them to the head.To make curls: attach tip of coil to head, twist the other end into a coil, then position it using clay tools or a toothpick.To make blunt-cut or straight-across bangs: roll out a thin sheet of clay, then cut it down to a triangle or rectangle shape that will fill in the gap on the forehead. Press it onto the forehead.\n Roll some yellow, pale yellow, or gold clay into a thin coil. Wrap the coil into a ring. For a fancier touch, use a soft, fluffy brush to dust gold eyeshadow onto the clay., Simply place the halo on top of the angel's head. For a stronger hold, coat the inside rim of the halo with liquid clay first., Measure the eye pin against the angel first. The eye part of the pin should rest right against the top of the angel's head. If the pin is too long, cut it down with a pair of wire cutters. Once the pin is the right length, push it right through the top of the angel., Follow the baking instructions on your package of clay, but only bake it for half the recommended time. This will bake the head, body, and arms the rest of the way. The hair, wings, and halo will also get baked all the way as they are thinner., Use a permanent pen to add to small dots for the eyes. Add two thin curves above each eye for the eyebrows.Draw a small curved line or a dot for the mouth. If you carved a mouth, you don't have to draw it.\n\nAlternatively, you can paint on the face instead using acrylic paint and a thin paintbrush.\nAdd some blush with a q-tip, if desired. You can use colored powder, actual blush, or pink water color. Keep the blush light and pale., Choose a glaze meant for polymer clay, then apply it using a paintbrush. You can also add some iridescent glitter glue along the wings and base to make it more sparkly., If you want to use the angel as a charm: twist open a jump ring with a pair of needle nose pliers. Slip the jump ring through the eye pin, then twist it close. If you want to use the angel as an ornament: thread some string through the eye pin. Tie the ends of the string together into a loop.\n\nYou can also use the angel as a figurine. Stand it on your desk, shelf, or wherever you'd like.\n\n"}

If choosing fiction, you can either go with a short yet classic folk tale or you can write your own story. If choosing non-fiction, look for a subject that a child might find appealing, like space, dinosaurs, or animals.\nYou don't need to think of this as a tried-and-true \"book.\" It can double as a letter, proposal, or a thoughtful addition to any gift.;\n, Limit the number of pop-out elements you use to prevent your pages from looking cluttered or becoming too weak to stand. The fewer cuts you make in your pages, the more durable the pages will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to add other craft elements to make it better. But even too many of these can make your pages look busy and weigh them down unnecessarily.\n Create a storyboard. Write the story or script out on notebook paper, separating it into different paragraphs or lines when you anticipate needing a new page. Sketch out a rough draft of the illustrations you want to use for each page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you actually create the book, it is important that you know how many pages you will need along with how many pictures you will need and where to put them.\n A 9-by-12-inch (23-by-30-cm) sheet of construction paper works well, but you can also use cardstock, thin poster paper, or scrap booking paper of just about any size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paper must be thicker than an ordinary sheet of printer paper. Fold the paper in half horizontally to create the book's cover.\n The slits should be about 2 inches (5 cm) long and spaced about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. These slits will create a tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen your paper. Position it vertically so that its height appears longer than its width. Use your finger or a thin pencil or pen to gently pry the tab forward.\n You can either draw and color the illustrations on separate sheets of construction paper or cardstock, or you can cut pictures from photographs, magazines, or recycled picture books and paste those pictures onto sturdier cardstock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the pictures you create or use roughly correspond to the size of your book page. Also make sure that you have all the characters and images you need for your entire book, rather than the single page.\nSet aside an empty space at the bottom of the page for text. If you plan on having a child write the story out, you may want to use a ruler to draw lines to make it easier for him or her. You could also glue a portion of lined notebook paper in the space.\n\nIf you plan on writing it out yourself, however, you can leave the space blank or print text out from your computer and paste it onto the page later.\n Use the same folding and cutting technique to create as many pages as you need to bring the tale to an end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview your story. Make sure that you have the illustrations and pictures planned out accurately as well as the text. Also make sure that you have enough pages created!\n\n, Go through the pages and write or paste the text to the bottom of each page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have more text than you have room for, attach a piece of paper that folds out upon opening to the too-small text area. Problem solved!\n\n, Sketch the background out in pencil before coloring it in with your coloring medium of choice. Leave the tabs blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a good eraser, go back and erase your pencil lines after completion.\n Cut out the pictures and illustrations you created. Glue the back of each one onto its corresponding tab. Do not allow it to get stuck to the background portion of the page, however. Then it won't pop!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using runny glue, be sure not to use too much. Apply the glue to the tab and not the picture; that way you won't risk getting glue above or below the tab.\n The pages need to be glued together back to back. The top outer half of the second page would be glued to the lower outer half of the first page. The top outer half of the third page would be glued to the lower outer half of the second page. Continue this pattern until all the pages are attached to one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not glue any of the pop up tabs together, though, since doing so will prevent them from popping up.\n Fold a sheet of heavy paper that is slightly larger than the rest over the book. Slide the folded paper away from the book, decorate the back and front outer covers, and then glue the back and front inner covers to the first and last pages of the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis, of course, is entirely optional.

If you need to save the wings or other parts of the duck for ID, later, do so.\n\n\nAlternatively, if you're plucking, some hunters like to leave the feet on to hold onto during the plucking process. It's up to you. You can always remove them later, if you wish.\n There's not much of a secret to removing the outer layer of large feathers: just start plucking. They'll be tenacious, so you might just need to pull them one at a time, or a few at a time, pulling them straight out from the carcass.\n Smaller feathers are more quickly plucked several at a time, working from the bottom of the bird up toward the neck, against the grain. If you've got the right leverage and the right amount of elbow grease, you can get these feathers off a lot more quickly with some practice. Use your thumb and forefinger to start ripping them back and off.\n\n\nYou won't be able to remove all the feathers this way. You'll be left with a fine layer of super-soft downy feathers that are next-to impossible to remove by hand. Collect all the rest of the feathers in a bag for easy removal. They're also excellent for stuffing and other projects.\n In a large pot, boil enough water in which to submerge the duck, and melt in a block of paraffin wax, available at most grocery stores and other outlets. It should float in a layer right on top of the hot water. When you're ready, remove the water from the heat.\n\n\nUse one package or block of paraffin wax per duck. It's likely you won't need to really boil the water to melt the wax, so keep a close eye on it. When the wax is melted, the water is fine and you're ready to dunk the birds.\n Quickly and gently dunk the bird through the layer of wax floating on top of the water, then immediately submerge the duck into a bucket of cold water to set the wax firmly. You don't need to soak the bird for longer than a couple of seconds, and in fact it's better to do it quickly. Before you've removed the entrails, it's important not to heat up the carcass too much, or you'll risk some spoilage.Immediately after pulling the duck from the hot wax bath, dunk it into a bucket of cold water to set the wax. You can let the duck sit in the cold water for a minute or two while the wax sets up, but it should happen very quickly.\n Now, there should be a hard crust of wax around the duck, which you can peel away to remove the downy under feathers. Squeeze the bird around the midsection to crack the wax and peel away the chunks in as large a portions as possible. The under skin should look very clean, like a chicken you bought at the store.\n\n"}

The polyps that are in the uterus can also be removed in a procedure called a polypectomy. This procedure is advised when the bleeding is excessive and the patient has fibroids in the uterus.\nThe patient is likely to have staining or spotting for up to eight weeks after surgery, and is advised to avoid the use of tampons in order to prevent infection. The woman may also be advised to avoid sexual intercourse until completely recovered to allow healing.\n Endometrial ablation is when the lining of the uterus is removed or destroyed.\n\n\nThis will either significantly reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding, or stop the patient's periods altogether. This is not a good option for people who are planning to have more children in the future.\nThis procedure is usually done in the doctor\u2019s office or it can also be done in a health center. The woman may have nausea, cramping, and vaginal discharge that is mixed with blood after the surgery.\nThese symptoms may last for approximately 1 to 2 weeks. After this time, the menstrual period is reduced in some women, while other women will stop having their period altogether.\n There are several different techniques that can be used for endometrial ablation and they include:\n\n\n\nElectrocautery: This is where an electric current that travels through a roller ball is used to cauterize the endometrial lining.\n\nHydrothermal therapy:This is where heated fluid is pumped into the uterus and the endometrial lining is destroyed by high temperatures.\n\nBalloon therapy: A balloon filled with fluid is attached to a catheter and inserted in the uterus. This water is heated, causing it to erode the endometrial tissue.\n This is a surgical procedure in which the whole uterus is removed. This procedure is done in a surgical theater by a surgeon.\n\n\nThis procedure is usually done in women who are in menopause or in those who are not planning to have any more children. As the uterus is removed entirely, the woman will no longer experience menstruation or be able to bear children.\nThe patient will usually have to stay in the hospital for approximately four days following the procedure for observation.

Therefore, we need not write them at all \u2013 row-reducing the coefficient matrix is all that is necessary.\n\nNote that moving everything to the left side causes the elements on the right side to negate.\n\n\n(381\u221212\u22124\u22122100\u2212100443\u221240\u22123\u22121021\u22123\u221220010\u22121200){\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}3&8&1&-12&-4&-2\\\\1&0&0&-1&0&0\\\\4&4&3&-40&-3&-1\\\\0&2&1&-3&-2&0\\\\0&1&0&-12&0&0\\end{pmatrix}}}\n\n\n, For such a matrix, it is recommended that you use a calculator, although row-reducing by hand is always an option, albeit slower. \n\n\n(10000\u22121/1201000\u2212100100\u22127/400010\u22121/1200001\u22127/4){\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0&0&-1/12\\\\0&1&0&0&0&-1\\\\0&0&1&0&0&-7/4\\\\0&0&0&1&0&-1/12\\\\0&0&0&0&1&-7/4\\end{pmatrix}}}\n\nIt is clear that there is a free variable x6{\\displaystyle x_{6}} here.

This is why hamsters need chews and sand to keep their teeth and nails filed down. Occasionally, you may need to have your hamster's teeth or nails trimmed if they become overgrown. Unless you're professionally trained, it's best to take your hamster into the vet when he needs a trim. You want to make sure the procedure is done safely and your hamster is not hurt in the process., Hamsters are not always friendly to new pets. If you're going to introduce a second hamster, do so when your current hamster is still young. Also, do not place a male and female in the same cage unless you want them to breed. Hamsters are very fertile and a female can give birth to 3 to 18 babies every 30 days.If you do add a new hamster, you should spend several days introducing them. Keep your hamsters in separate cages where they can see each other for a few days. When you do place them in the same cage, keep an eye on them to make sure there's no fighting. You might want to wear protective gloves during the introduction. In the event of a fight, you may have to separate the hamsters., As stated, a wheel is an essential part of your hamster's health. However, you want to make sure your hamster's wheel is big enough for safe use. Small wheels can cause back problems from your hamster bending his back to fit the wheel. If you have a larger hamster, go for a bigger sized wheel.At minimum, look for a wheel of at least 6.5 inches. Certain types of hamster, like Syrian hamsters, tend to grow very big. In this case, you should get a wheel that's at lest 8 inches., You should never let your hamster out of his cage unsupervised. If you use a hamster ball or similar device, only allow your hamster to roam in it when you're watching. Accidents and mishaps can occur, resulting in injury and even death. Your hamster should never be allow to roam the house without supervision."}

Dampen a piece of extra fine steel wool and use it to rub areas you think might be waxed.Wax will show up as a light grey smudge or smear on the steel wool.\nFloors that date prior to 1930 typically have many layers of paste wax over a tung oil finish or shellac. You can screen and re-wax the floor or use a chemical stripper to remove the wax and apply a modern polyurethane finish.\n The easiest and gentlest way to restore an old floor to its former glory is to screen it with a buffer. After cleaning the floor, use a handheld sanding screen to roughen up the edges and corners of the room where the buffer can't access. Use a buffer with a 150- or 120-grit sanding disc to screen the floor, or buff down the existing finish.The sanding discs will wear out, so you'll need at least three to screen a typical room.\n Once you've finished buffing, wipe down windowsills and other surfaces and vacuum the room thoroughly to remove all dust.Your choice of finish will depend on the results of your wax test.\n\n\nFor waxed floors, apply paste wax. If your floor was finished with a modern sealer, go with polyurethane. You can't use one if you started with the other: don't apply wax to a polyurethane finish or vice versa., If your floor is more than 50 years old, you should avoid sanding it. There's a limit to how much wood you can remove without permanently damaging the floor. When cleaning and reviving an old hardwood floor, sand only if it's so heavily stained that screening or chemical stripping aren't options., Get professional help if your old hardwood flooring is seriously worn or damaged, or if you're unsure about its composition. Word of mouth is typically the best way to find a good contractor. Look for one with restoration experience who won't advise you to simply rip out the entire floor unless absolutely necessary.For example, if your floor needs patching, you could have an experienced contractor remove flooring from a hidden spot, like a closet, and use it to replace a worn or damaged area.\n\n"}

The life vest must be properly fitted so that it does not slip up on the body when falling.\n\n\nIt should fit snugly but not be uncomfortable.\nBe sure to check the manufacturer\u2019s label for weight limits and sizing information. ;\n, You will want a pair of combination skis, which are suitable for beginners and have two skis with one ski having a half-foot binding behind the other foot. Skis for beginners will usually be wider and thus more stable on the water. They will be made for different weight ranges so it is important to pick a water ski that suits your size.\n\n\nCheck the manufacturer recommendations for the recommended weight ranges for the particular skis you are looking at.\nKids skis are different in that they are smaller and easier for small children to control. They will usually come with a \u201ctrainer\u201d option, or when you tie the skies together to prevent the skier from losing their balance and performing the splits.\nThe bindings will usually be adjustable for a range of sizes to fit a variety of people., Trainer skis for kids can often be tied together, preventing the child from doing the \u201csplits\u201d. Kids usually have a hard time keeping control over their skis and keeping them together so this can be incredibly helpful when beginning.\n A water skiing rope will have a little stretch only and be 75 feet (22.86 meters) long from the handle to the opposite end. Do not use a wakeboarding rope, which will have no stretch, or a rope that is too stretchy.\n\n\nThe rope should be labelled and marketed specifically for water skiing.\n There are seven different hand signals that a skier should learn. These are important for signalling the boat driver while water skiing.\n\n\nA thumbs-up means go faster while a thumbs-down means slow down. It is important to remember this while skiing so that you do not accidentally ask for more speed.\nBring thumb and forefinger together to signal OK. This tells the driver that the speed and path are good.\nPoint your finger in the air and move it in a circular motion and then point to the direction when you want to turn a certain way. This can be used by the water skier to signal that they want to go a particular way or by the boat driver to warn the skier of a turn.\nPat your head to signal that you would like to return to the dock. You can do this if you are tired and want to finish.\nA slashing motion at the neck means to stop the boat immediately. This can be done by the skier, driver or observer in case of emergencies.\nClasp your hands over your head after a fall to signal that you are OK. This should be done after every fall., Many states require boats to have ski flags. These are usually bright coloured flags that signal to other boats that there is a skier in the water. Every time the skier is in the water and not skiing, the flag must be held up for other boats to see.\n\n\nThis is an important safety measure and most boats will need an observer who is in charge of watching the skier and holding the flag., The proper stance for starting to water ski is called the \u201ccannonball\u201d position.\n\n\nWhile on dry land, put the skis on your feet.\nHold the handle and bend your knees so that you are sitting on the skis in the same form you would use to complete a cannonball.\nHave someone pull gently on the other end of the rope to help pull you up into into a chair position. You will look like you are sitting in a chair, even though there is not one.\nMake sure your knees stay together at all times and that you keep your arms straight to allow the rope to pull you up., The most important aspect of pulling a water skier is to start quickly, or have a lot of torque. This means that you must have a relatively strong boat and that you start from zero very quickly. This will help the water skier to get up on their skis smoothly.\n It is very important that the driver pull steadily to ensure a smooth ride for the water skier. If they change speeds or turn suddenly it can be very difficult for a beginning water skier to maintain balance.\n Usually early morning works best when water skiing because that is when the water is at its calmest. Later in the day there may be more traffic and thus rougher waters.\n\n\nIf you do hit rough water or wakes, then you should hit them at a 90 degree angle to minimize the bumps for the water skier.\nIt is important to make water skiing fun for kids so try to pick a time which is suitable for everyone when teaching them.\n Speeds will vary according to the size and experience level of the skier but there are general guidelines for water skiing. Kids should be pulled as slow as possible while keeping them out of the water. The speeds described here are for water skiing on two skis only.\n\n\nWater skiers who are less than 50 lbs. (<23 kg) should be pulled at about 13 mph (21 km/h).\nWater skiers who are 50-100 lbs. (23-45 kg) should be pulled at about 16 mph (26 km/h).\nWater skiers who are 100-150 lbs. (45-68 kg) should be pulled at about 18 mph (29 km/h).\nWater skiers who are 150-180 lbs. (68-82 kg) should be pulled at about 21 mph (34 km/h).\nWater skiers who are more than 180 lbs. (>82 kg) should be pulled at about 24 mph (38 km/h).\nAdjust your speed on turns. If the skier is on the inside of a turn then they will slow down and you may need to speed up. If they are on the outside of the turn they may speed up and you may need to slow down., You can easily slingshot a water skier on a turn so it is important to make sure that you keep far enough away from any docks or obstacles. Additionally, if a skier lets go they can travel quite far before sinking into the water so keep this in mind.\n\n\nDo not go over any shallow water or where there may be obstructions just above or below the surface of the water.\nMost ski accidents occur from collisions with docks or other solid objects so be very careful about staying in open water., You should usually have an observer on the boat to help you watch the skier in case they fall or are signalling the boat. It will be difficult for the driver to watch where they are going and keep an eye on the skier at the same time.\n\n\nThe observer will be the one controlling the ski flag and relaying signals to the driver.\n It is always good practice and safer to turn off the propeller completely when near anyone in the water. As soon as you get close, turn off the propeller and let your momentum bring the boat alongside them.\n\n\nBe very careful not to injure the skier when bringing the boat near. Do not come too close and always turn off the propeller.\n An EZ ski trainer helps kids get used to being pulled behind a boat before trying to get them up on water skis. This device is like an inflatable jet ski that will be pulled behind a boat on a rope. It also helps kids build confidence, learn how to hold the hand and maintain balance.\n\n\nThe kids can sit or stand as they feel comfortable, learning how to balance and getting accustomed to being pulled behind a boat.\nBe patient with kids and allow them to go at their own pace. This trainer can help reduce some of their nervousness before water skiing., Sit on the side of the boat or at the dock and put the water skis on. They should be adjusted for your correct size and you will usually simply have to slip your feet inside to secure them. The foot should be tight so it may take a little wiggling to get your feet in all the way.\n\n\nIt can help to wet the skis before putting them on, because it makes them easier to slide on your feet.\nKids may need assistance with getting their skis on properly so help them when necessary.\n Hold the rope with your two hands next to each other. Both palms should be facing down for water skiing on two skis. Make sure your grip is secure and your arms stick straight out in front of you., Allow your personal flotation device or lifejacket to keep you on top of the water and lean back. Bring your knees to your chest, with your arms around the outsides of your knees as if you are hugging them.\n\n\nBring the rope in between the tips of your skis with the handle between your body and the ski tips.\n While leaning back with your knees to your chest, bring your ski tips up out of the water, keeping your skis straight and close together. Water skis should be no more than hip width apart.\n\n\nKids skis will often have a rope or other device holding them together. This helps keep their skis together to maintain control.\n With the rope between your skis and your hands holding the handle securely between your body and the ski tips, keep your arms straight in front of you. This is a very important aspect of getting up on water skis.\n\n\nIt is very important to let the boat pull you out of the water and up onto your skis.\nIf you try to bend your arms or pull yourself up out of the water, you will likely lose your balance and fall.\n If you are close to shore, someone can hold the water skier in their arms, keeping their skis together and helping them to balance while leaning back with their knees to their chest.\n\n\nThis can be especially helpful for children, who may lose their balance or form while waiting for the boat to go.\n There cannot be any slack in the rope with the boat starts going or else it will jerk the water skier forward and cause them to lose their balance. Once the rope is in the water skier\u2019s hands the boat can move forward at a slow pace until the rope is tight.\n\n\nThe water skier may move slightly forward through the water while the rope is being tightened. Be careful to stay balanced and maintain your form.\n Yell \u201chit it!\u201d to the driver to signal that you are ready to begin. The boat will start quickly forward. Keep your form together and stay calm and confidence. Being confident and relaxed is very important for getting up easily on water skis.\n\n\nIt is more important that the boat has a lot of torque, or picks up speed quickly, rather than that it achieves a high speed., Keep your \u2018cannonball\u2019 form while leaning back slightly with your arms straight in front of you as you allow the boat to pull you up. The skis should be directly underneath you even though you are leaning back slightly. Do not stand up immediately.\n\n\nBending your arms to pull yourself up will only cause you to lose your balance so keep them straight.\nKeep your eyes directly ahead. Putting your eyes and head up to avoid splash can make you lose your balance while looking down will likely cause you to fall down.\n Having your knees bent is imperative both before the boat starts and while you are trying to get up on skis. This will help you to maintain balance properly and better control your skis.\n\n\nEven if the water is quite smooth, there will always be small bumps so keeping your knees bent will help to absorb those bumps.\n If you are comfortable being pulled and are balanced, try standing up. While standing keep your feet and skis directly beneath you and simply straighten out your legs while continuing to lean back slightly with your arms directly in front of you.\n\n\nIt might be best for kids to try skiing once or twice while remaining in the \u2018cannonball\u2019 form the entire time. This helps them to get used to water skiing and maintaining balance and control.\n It can be tricky to keep your balance while learning how to water ski. Be patient with yourself and keep your confidence. If you are getting frustrated you can give yourself a break and try again later.\n\n\nCovering your face with your hands when you float back up to the surface can help prevent you from getting banged in the face by the ski if it falls off.\nHold up your arm or a water ski while the boat and turning to come back to you so that other boaters can see you and avoid you.\n Bending your knees will help you to absorb any bumps or wakes that the boat traverses, helping you maintain balance and continue standing.\n Do not try to pull yourself forward or maintain balance by pulling on the rope. You should simply allow the rope to continue pulling you forward.\n Lean back slightly with your hips forming a straight line with your shoulders. You can push your hips slightly forward and up towards the handle but make sure the skis stay directly beneath you.\n\n\nAllowing the skis to move to far out in front of you will cause you to fall backwards.\nLeaning forward will cause the skis to move behind you and make you fall forward. , Many skiers tend to hold their breaths while skiing but it is important to breathe naturally. Normal breathing will reduce fatigue and prevent you from getting overly tired.\n Try turning slightly by putting more pressure on the inside edge of the ski on the opposite side of where you want to go. Stay inside the wake for now.\n\n\nFor example, you will push down on the inside edge of the ski with your left leg and lean slightly to the right and away from the boat to move to the right. At the same time you can lift up slightly with your right foot to help you turn.\nMake sure you keep proper positioning with your knees bent and arms straight in front of you while you turn., Make a turn to either side and cross the wakes by turning your skis at a sharp angle to the wake. Keep pressure on your ski closest to the boat until you are completely outside the wake.\n\n\nKeep your knees bent to absorb the shock.\nIf you try to cross with one ski at a time, you will fall. Make sure you cross at a sharp angle to the wake with both skis at the same time.\nGoing over the wake should be quite quick. If you try to go slowly, you will fall.\nKeep your arms straight in front of you while crossing the wake. Pulling on the handle is a common mistake made by beginners and can also cause you to lose your balance and fall."}

Otherwise you can get away with a short sleeved shirt under the jacket as it won't be seen. The shirt for handlers should be long sleeved and have a collar. The shirt should be buttoned all the way up the front. A slinky, (suitable more so for females) should have a turtle neck type collar. You are required to have your shirt tucked in unless it is a slinky and sits right on the gab between your pants and skin line, no skin should be seen.\n Jackets come in two basic cuts for Showmanship and Halter - cropped and long. A cropped Jacket sits just on the pants line, and gives a flattering appearance. A longer Jacket is one that may or may not have a split similar to that of a riding Jacket. It gives a longer appearance and many judges prefer a longer jacket to a cropped or a shirt style top. If you go for a specially designed halter outfit, look for one that suits your body shape. The Halter outfits are usually made of leather and do up at either the front or back depending on the design and shape. They are good for the handler that does a lot of Halter showing as they are less likely to get dirty and can be wiped clean with a damp cloth. They are also especially good as they are at most good Western Attire Retailers and the designs are quite bright so they suit a new Handler wanting to make an impression.\n The buckle can be either Glitzy and Glamour with Rhinestones and Diamantes or it can be a silver plaited trophy type buckle. Either is well suited, and this just makes the outfit. If you don't wear a belt and buckle you can be eliminated from the event.\n They can have fancy stitching or embroidery or they can be plain. During a Halter or Showmanship event you must always wear a hat. This can have a Hat band and can be glitzy or plain. To finish the look wear a neck piece such as a Yolk band or bolo tie for males and a piece of jewellery such as a necklace or bolo tie for the woman.\n\n"}

If you are patient, it will be recognized and appreciated. However, if staff is overtly ignoring you or has not noticed you, a polite \"excuse me\" is appropriate.\n If you want to take a moment to look at the menu, say so. If you are wondering what a certain drink is, ask. If you are stumped as to what to get, ask for a recommendation. If you are clear about what you want it will be easier for the person serving you to help you, and you will be more satisfied with the end result.\n Changing your mind is your prerogative, and it is perfectly fine if you forgot to specify skim milk, or decided at the last minute to get something to eat or to pick up something for a friend. Just try to stay within reason and make minor adjustments, for the sake of your server as well as the other customers.\n Do not interrupt your server just to complain; wait until they are finished with the next customer or speak with someone who is free. Do not whine (\"this always happens when I come here\") and do not make accusations (\"you made me the wrong drink\"). Simply state what the problem is, and you will likely be given a replacement or be reimbursed with no fuss.\n Just be sure to respond if a staff member says \"good-bye\" or \"have a nice day\". If you leave a good impression, it will probably carry over to your next visit.\n Drive-thru staff are trained to greet you as soon as your vehicle is detected by a sensor, and if your window is rolled up you might not hear them. This can be confusing, especially if they request that you give them a moment before you place your order.\nTurn off the radio, pause the conversation,make the dog stop barking and,if necessary,(particularly for trucks and SUVs) turn off the engine in order to be understood more easily. The driver should be the one to place the order, being closest to the microphone.\nIf you need time to look over the menu board, do not simply ignore the server's greeting. Tell him/her that you need a moment to decide. Then decide as quickly as possible so that other customers are not kept waiting.\nKeep in mind that drive-thru service was created to be fast and convenient. This means that large orders, ground coffee/coffee beans and merchandise purchases should not be made in drive-thru. You will be served faster in these cases if you walk into the cafe.\nPay with cash, or with gift cards. Credit cards and debit take longer and do not always work consistently.

Call them up regularly to check in and schedule time to hang out. Spend some time each day interacting with your family.\n\n\nYou might even plan a family reunion.\n In addition to family, spend time with friends as well. If possible, avoid going to the movies or over to their house to watch a show. Instead, plan dinners, mini vacations to the beach, or trips to the bowling alley or skating rink., Beyond your family and friends, there are likely many others that you interact with on a day to day basis like the janitor who works in your office, the lunch lady in your school, or your coworkers. Instead of tuning them out or putting in your headphones, engage with them in conversation. This will help you stay more connected to the real world., Take a good look around you and attend to any household duties that may need to be taken care of. This can include anything from fixing a leaking tap to fixing up the garden. Improving your cooking or cuisine skills is also another option to consider.\n Register for any courses that you are interested in or even consider going back to school. This will make a great and significant demand on your time. This will also keep you occupied and productive., There are many other activities to engage in besides television. Spend some time exploring old hobbies of yours and developing new ones. You can do things like read, ride horses, dance, or garden., There is a whole exciting world outside of your home that you have likely not explored because of your TV addiction.

Once you get to the point where you are saying to yourself and everyone else that you're just trying to be what everyone else wants, you have reached a point where you cannot be free.\nDetach yourself from \"toxic\" people in your life. These are the people who try to tie you down through manipulation, negativity, and other forms of control. Better still, learn how to disarm such people by learning non-violent communication techniques and standing your ground through being less reactive and more responsive and assertive; you have the power within you to remain free of such people and to live free from their harmful ways. Good friends will help you find your balance.;\n, Be free by focusing on what can be done, rather than on what cannot. Shift your attention to what you can do to make things better for yourself and for others. By doing this, you'll find greater freedom to live the life you want to live.\n\n\nRemind yourself of your successes instead of your failures. If work or school isn't going as well as it might, focus on your family, your relationships, or how awesome you've become at shooting three-pointers. Focus on the positive.\nWatch your language. Avoid negative statements like \"I can't.\" Language is powerful, both in convincing yourself and in convincing others. By changing these negative phrases to ones focused on what can be done, you will free yourself from inaction and procrastination. Instead, say, \"I've got to do this.\"\n\n, Lies create a tangled web of deceit that keeps you from being free. Learn to recognize the lies you tell yourself and others. Being sincere and truthful allows you to connect better with people you can trust because they can identify with your vulnerability.\n\n\nLies are one form of reacting defensively; for many of us, it is natural to feel a need to defend ourselves in a situation of conflict.\nLying during a conflict may seem like a good, defensive way of getting someone to leave you alone but it binds you even more tightly to that person because you've made things less clear and have evaded your real needs rather than stood up for yourself.\nBy responding with loving kindness, you regain your freedom in relationships because you learn to acknowledge the pain, hurt and other negative feelings of others without escalating the conflict and still make it clear that you retain your power to make your own decisions and choices.\n Many people associate \"having enough money\" with freedom, but your attitude toward money says much more about freedom than money itself. Treat money as a tool in your life, not the driver of your life. Learn to save, budget and be a conscious consumer.\n\n\nLook for what you can do to remove yourself from parts of the consuming cycle that you feel burden you. For example, if you're fed up paying high prices for organic food, dig up your lawn and plant a beautiful vegetable and fruit garden instead. Tend to it regularly, knowing that the fruits of your labor are repaid through communion with nature, health through quality food and role modeling sustainable behavior to your children, neighbors and friends.\n Start bartering your skills with others who have skills in making things you can't or don't enjoy making, so that a virtuous cycle kicks into place. From this, you will also gain friendships and connections that might just amaze you.\n\n\nMake use of online resources to connect with like-minded people, share items and services, and to encourage others to get involved in ways of living more freely. One site you might find useful is Sharehood, a collaborative consumption website that helps you to bring together local community and your neighbors for sharing resources and skills.\n Exercise can release endorphins that change your mood for the better, and staying in shape will ensure that you're able to do the things you want to do. Don't let your lack of health keep you from being free to do what you want to do. Choose something you enjoy doing, as exercise should be fun in itself rather than being viewed as a means to something else.Release endorphins to free your spirit. Endorphins are your body's own mood lighteners, bio-chemicals produced by your brain in response to pleasant experiences. Endorphins help you to free yourself from unhelpful emotions that can trap you in ongoing cycles of negativity. The ways to help release endorphins do you good, such as exercising, socializing and laughing, all freeing you up to focus on the things that truly matter to you in life.\n Your smile changes your frame of mind. Make a point of laughing at something every day. Start with laughing at your own antics or fun thoughts, then expand to watching a funny movie or going to a comedy club or just doing something that will encourage you to laugh. Laughing and smiling boosts your immune system as well as making you feel better by releasing endorphins. Laughing lets your brain know you're happy, and gets you in a great mood, in the right state of mind.\n The sun can brighten up your day as well as your mood. Go to open spaces, do some trekking, enjoy nature and spend time around people. Obviously, observe sun safe procedures during the hottest months.\n Being with friends brings out your empathy; understanding and being understood can improve your sense of well-being, also helping to release endorphins. In addition, spending time with friends and being social has been shown to increase serotonin levels, also important for improving your inner well-being.\n Being open to new experiences is a source of freedom because you're expanding your horizons, discovering new hidden talents and keeping yourself open to the goodness of life.\n\n\nSee new experiences as opportunities rather than as burdens or something to be worried about. Most of the battle is inside your head, before you've given the new activity a go.\nCongratulate yourself every time you try something new. And tell others what you've done, to reinforce its good. Your story may help others to live more freely too\n\n, Movies all have soundtracks and so should you. Walking down the street on a horrible rainy day, pick yourself up with something that gets your feet moving and your mind entertained.\n Spontaneity is often lost upon entering the adult world of work, parenting and societal obligations. Conforming to what's expected of each adult in society tends to quell the opportunities for breaking free now and then, to do something out-of-character. Restoring a little spontaneity and impulsiveness to your life can bring back some balance.\n\n\nCheck out the fun things that Improv Everywhere has done, like gathering over two hundred people to walk around downtown using the famous \"invisible dog\" toy and pretending they were real. Doing something that makes people stare is a great way to live free and get out of the box you're trapped in.\nLook for flash mob videos online to find actions that have brought laughter and enjoyment to people's lives.\n Go outside and start walking. Just keep walking in no particular direction and don't stop until you have to. There's something great about taking a walk with no direction or goal in mind.\n It's okay to act on impulse without thinking it through sometimes. Have pie for breakfast or shave your head without warning if you want to. Embrace surprises and spontaneity. Shaking up the regular way of things can help you to become more enthusiastic about each day. Who knows what will happen!\n\n, You don't have to be good at whatever it is that fills you with passion, you just have to love it. Maybe it's writing, maybe it's drawing, maybe it's playing sports of some kind. Whatever it is, embrace it with all your heart and allow yourself to get completely involved with it. Tell your family about it, convince your friends to try it, go crazy and let your life revolve around that something you love.\n\n"}

Recognizing this pattern may help you know how to steer a conversation and or reveal your friend\u2019s insecurities.\n\n\nIf your friend always makes jealous, spiteful comments while hanging out in a group, they may put you down in an effort to bolster their waning self-confidence.\nIf your friend always makes envious remarks after you\u2019ve shared plans with for your future, they may feel like their future isn\u2019t as promising as yours.;\n, Jealous comments reveal a lot about the person making the invidious statement.

Is your friend always telling you that you\u2019re not good at something? Do they frequently make fun of your appearance?\n\n\nIf your friend is super critical of your possessions, they may be struggling to define their identity outside of their possessions and finances.\nIf your friend makes negative comments about your success, they may be jealous about the opportunities you are receiving or envious of your talents.\nIf your friend constantly critiques your appearance, they may feel insecure about their own physical appearance., Jealous comments usually serve a dual purpose. First and foremost, these remarks are meant to make you feel bad about yourself. You should also consider that your friend may be mad at you, building herself up by cutting you down, or trying to manipulate you. There is also the possibility that your friend treats everyone they encounter in this manner.\n\n\nYour friend could be mad at you for numerous reasons, petty or otherwise. Is there a reason your friend might be angry with you? Did you recently fight? Did you forget to call them back? Were you gossiping about them?\nIn order to diminish and distract from our own faults, insecurities, or fears, we have a tendency to point out other's failings. Is your friend struggling with self-confidence or body image issues? Are they feeling unsure about their future?\nCutting someone down can make a person feel more powerful and confident. Does your friend thrive on feeling superior and in charge?, Humans are complex beings. Our emotional, mental, and physical health are interconnected and inform our mood, actions, and words. While you may perceive your friend's comments as jealous statements, there may be more to their envious quips than meets the eye. Instead of writing your friend off as jealous and petty, ask your friend how they are doing.\n\n\nSome people struggle to manage their negative thoughts. If your friend is constantly comparing themselves to you, they may caught in a cycle of self-doubt and self-loathing. Their seemingly jealous remarks are making them feel worse instead of better about themselves.Recent studies suggest that individuals struggling with depression have a difficult time distinguishing between negative emotions.

If you value the friendship, address your friend\u2019s jealousy directly.

Note that you are worried about the status of your friendship and alarmed by the shift in their demeanor. Communicate your feelings clearly and listen attentively to your friend\u2019s response.Ask your friend how they are doing personally. Are they struggling at school, home, or work? Are their parents fighting? Did they just get out of a relationship? Were they passed over for a great opportunity? Are they coping with these challenges by acting out in jealousy towards you? Do they think your life is so much better or easier than their life?\nAsk if you did something to offend or upset them. Did you forget their last birthday? Did you fail to text or call them back?

Common characteristics of toxic individuals include:\n\n\nNeed to control others\nDisregard for personal boundaries\nSelfishness\nNeed to always be right\nDishonesty\nInability to accept responsibility for their actions\nTendency to play the victim, If your friend is a toxic individual, it may be in your best interest to take steps to either confront their negative behavior in an effort to improve or end the relationship. When you confront their harmful behavior:\n\n\nAcknowledge that you are coming from a place of love and honesty. \u201cIn the best interest of our friendship and my wellbeing, I must tell you the truth.\nTell them explicitly how you feel. \u201cI feel _______ when you _______.\u201d\nAsk them to stop their behavior. \u201cAre you willing to stop _______ so that we can have a healthier relationship?\u201d, Boundaries can provide structure and stability to a toxic relationship. Once you set these boundaries, they are non-negotiable\u2014do not let your friend bully you into changing the boundaries. You can start to set boundaries for your toxic relationship by answering these questions:\n\n\nWhen can your friend contact you?\nHow can they contact you?\nIn what circumstances will you contact your friend?\nHow will you contact them if you must get ahold of them?\nWill you ignore or acknowledge them when you see them in public?\nWill you block them on social media?\nMay they remain in contact with your family members?, If this individual can not honor the terms of your agreement, it is time to sever ties. Let them know that you can no longer maintain a relationship with them. When you confront this individual, have a clear and concise explanation ready.\n\n\nThey may pressure you for further details or attempt to manipulate your words. If this occurs, remind yourself that you don\u2019t need to justify your decision.Ending this relationship will be a process. Toxic individuals struggle to respect boundaries. As a result, cutting these individuals out of your life becomes a long, trying process. Remain firm in your resolution as you persistently work towards distancing yourself from them."}

If you hair breaks easily or quickly develops split ends, you may already be shampooing too often. Find a washing schedule that leaves your hair healthy and soft, so you can address the greasiness without destroying your hair.\n\n\nYou might be able to wash daily if you have very fine hair, live in a humid area, or exercise daily to the point of heavy sweating. For most people, washing once every 2\u20134 days is recommended. You may need to wash even less often if you have extra-curly African hair, or if you've treated your hair with keratin.Your hair will produce oil at the same rate, no matter how often you shampoo.;\n, Find a shampoo intended for oily or greasy hair. The most effective examples tend to include sulfates, which are infamous in some circles for the damage they can cause to skin and hair.Give it a try, but switch to a sulfate-free product if the shampoo irritates your skin or swings your hair too far in the dry, damaged direction.\n\n\nIf you can't find an effective, safe shampoo, you might be able to replace shampoo entirely with one of the home remedies below.\nAvoid products that advertise \"added shine,\" which is caused by oily ingredients.\n Dry shampoo is a scented powder that sits in your hair and absorbs grease, without rinsing away all your protective oils. Hold the can at least 6 inches (15 cm) away from your hair, and spray lightly onto the roots and mid-shafts in oily areas. Let sit for two minutes, then massage it into your hair with clean hands. Apply whenever your hair feels greasy, about 1\u20133 times between washes.Too much dry shampoo can cause white buildup. Apply lightly and to oily areas only (typically the layers of hair nearest to your scalp).\nDry shampoo is available in powder form as well as sprays. Choose this if you are sensitive to fragrance or aerosols.\nBaking soda, talcum powder and other powders are also effective for absorbing grease.\n Conditioner is designed to make your hair soft and silky, which is a short step from greasy. Only use it immediately after shampooing, when your hair is at its driest, and stick to a dollop the size of a small coin. Rub it into the ends of your hair only, as your roots are slick enough on their own.\n\n\nTo reduce the amount of conditioner even further, lightly apply a spray-on, leave-in conditioner instead.Surprisingly, a co-wash (using conditioner instead of shampoo) does actually remove some oil, though not as much as shampoo.However, co-washing is mainly beneficial for dry hair. Shampoo is a safer bet for someone with grease issues.\n Unsurprisingly, hair grease and its gel and mousse cousins won't do you any favors in the fight against oil. Stick to light products only, such as texturizing sprays. If you bust out the mousse for a special occasion, be sure to wash it out at the end of the day.\n Clarifying shampoos are extra-powerful products that strip out buildup from hair products. Because these are harsh enough to damage hair, use this once every 2nd to 4th wash.Never use clarifying shampoo on color treated hair, which will likely fade and may be vulnerable to damage.\n Many people with dandruff often think the problem is dry skin.

As of 2016, anticipate a starting price in the $4000-5000 range for the cheapest models. Budget accordingly and only purchase your Rolex when you can comfortably afford such an expensive item.Also note that:\n\n\nRolexes are often perceived as a status symbol, indicating a certain level of achievement in one\u2019s life. So if you wish to impress people by suggesting that you have personally achieved this level (whether or not you actually have), Rolexes are certainly an option.\nHowever, be aware that there is also a stigma attached to flashing a Rolex as a sign of success.Expect true enthusiasts to have a much more intimate knowledge of their timepieces beyond the pricetag.;\n, Buy a Rolex to honor a special occasion. Mark a significant turning point in your personal life, or treat yourself after a major achievement in your career. Give yourself a carrot to follow so you have more time to save more money, rather than limiting yourself to the cheapest models as soon as you can afford one.

Although there is a heavy trade in used Rolexes, play it safe and assume that you won\u2019t get all your money back if you buy a brand-new one., First, ask yourself how often you plan to wear it: every day, in certain situations, or only very special occasions? Then review your style of dress in those circumstances. Lastly, consider whether this Rolex will be your only one, or the beginning of a collection.If this is to be your only Rolex, stick to classic designs. Avoid trendy elements that may grow out of date or would be hard to match with multiple outfits, such as irregular-sized cases or colored dials.\n Visit dealers in person so you can try on different models. Deal directly with staff so they can answer any questions that you might have. Then take time to think about your options and preferences.

Shop a new Rolex to ensure a working watch.Or, purchase a used Rolex to (possibly) save money.Other considerations include:\n\n\nWith new watches, you are able to buy directly from Rolex dealers, minimizing the risk of fakes. Also, contemporary designs are guaranteed.\nWith vintage watches, prices may actually rise due to scarcity of a particular model.

Especially make a point of this if you plan on purchasing it from a source other than an official dealer. Use resources like internet forums, trade publications, and books to find out identifying marks like:Logos, fonts, and sizes.Reference numbers and where to find them.\nWhat engravings it should have, and where.\nMaterials used for luminescence.\n Now that you know more about what you want, choose where to make your purchase. For the easiest stress-free experience, buy directly from an official dealer for peace of mind.If you shop elsewhere:\n\n\nResearch dealers through customer reviews and similar sources to eliminate iffy sellers.\nBeware dealers that offer no warranties, return policies, or other forms of buyer protection.For \u201cshowy\u201d watches, prioritize official dealers, since the design elements of used watches may have been added after the fact by sources other than Rolex."}

You can also find a therapist through personal recommendations, professional contacts, or university resources.;\n, Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to family and friends when you need some support. If you feel alone, call a friend and arrange an activity to do together. Find the people you feel comfortable crying in front of and let yourself cry. If you need a venting session, call someone who you know will listen. IVF often includes many complex emotions, and it\u2019s okay to lean on people for support. Reaching out for support can help you cope with feelings of anxiety and depression.To ask for help, you can say, \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time, and I am reaching out for help. I\u2019m trying to keep it together, but I feel so overwhelmed. I\u2019d really appreciate a listening ear.\u201d\nYou can also say, \u201cIFV is really draining me, and I don\u2019t want my life to be consumed by it. I\u2019d like to get together with you and do something fun. Would you like to come over and watch a movie?\u201d\n\n, A support group can be a huge source of comfort and support during IVF. A support group can help you connect with other people who are enduring similar problems. Support groups are a good place to exchange support and advice and meet other people going through similar challenges.Ask your medical doctor or therapist for a referral.\n\n\nFind a local support group or join an online support network.\nUse reputable websites and avoid negative comments on discussion boards. It\u2019s easy to feel discouraged when reading negative comments. Keep in mind that other people\u2019s experiences may not be your experience.\n IVF can leave you feeling down and discouraged, yet don\u2019t forget to find humor whenever and wherever you can. Laughter helps to relax you, boost your immunity, increase your overall well-being, improve your mood, and relieve stress.Engage in activities you know will encourage you to laugh.\n\n\nThese activities may be watching funny movies or video clips, playing with pets or children, inviting friends over for a game night, or singing karaoke. Do things you know you will enjoy.\nCreate a video clip playlist you know will make you laugh. When you\u2019re feeling down, discouraged, or anxious, watch some funny videos and notice how your feel.\n Going through IVF is not a process you should feel alone in. You may feel many emotions and not know how to put them in words or express them to others. Art can help you with self-discovery and emotional growth.You may choose to paint, listen to music, or create music as a way to express your emotions. Whatever you do, allow yourself an emotional outlet for you to feel fully and express your emotions.\n\n\nJournaling can be a great way to express yourself. You can help clarify your thoughts and feelings, reduce stress, and solve problems more effectively.Check out How to Keep a Feelings Journal.\n Not taking care of yourself can contribute to symptoms of both anxiety and depression. It can also adversely affect the outcome of your treatments.Aim to get good sleep each night, between 7-9 hours to help keep your mood balanced and depression at bay. Eat properly and prioritize your nutrition as a way to keep your energy levels high and your mood stabilized.Ask your physician what physical activity you can perform, as exercise is a great way to bust depression and cope with stress and anxiety., Recognize when you are feeling anxious. You may become anxious before procedures, during treatments, or waiting for test results. Notice your anxiety and bring awareness to it. Some common symptoms of anxiety include apprehension and dread, feeling tense and jumpy, sweating, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, muscle tension, stomach upset, and pounding heart.You may want to write a list of places or events that make you feel anxious. Then, write possible ways for you to lessen these anxieties.\nFor example, if you are anxious about needles, know when you can anticipate needles, then bring a book or listen to music when around them.\nTo learn more about anxiety, check out How to Know if You Have Anxiety.\n One way to reduce anxiety is to practice relaxation. You can practice relaxation right before a nerve-wracking event, during the event, or use relaxation every day as a way to prevent anxiety and cope with stress regularly. Relaxation is a great way to handle stress and anxiety.Practice visualizing a calm and peaceful place by making it come to life. Listen to the sounds, see the sights, and imagine being at this serene location. You may choose a wooded forest, a deserted beach, or the top of a mountain. Feel the temperature, imagine the wind against your body, and look around for any animals present.\n\nPractice progressive muscle relaxation. Lie down and get comfortable. Tense the muscles in your left toes, then relax. Do the same for your right toes, then move onto each of your feet. One muscle group at a time, work up your body, tensing and relaxing., Focusing on your breath is a great way to reduce anxiety. If you are feeling anxious during a procedure or in anticipation of a situation, redirect your thoughts to your breath. You may want to spend a few moments preparing for your procedure by focusing on your breathing. You can do breathing exercises alone or with other people around; it\u2019s unlikely other people will notice.\n\n\nTo practice deep breathing, slowly breathe in through your nose, then hold it for two seconds. Gently exhale through your mouth. While breathing, make sure your breathe through your diaphragm, which means your belly should move and not your shoulders. Pause between each breath cycle. Do this exercise a few times until you begin to feel calm.You can also check out How to Do Breathing Exercises for more tips and information.\n Because IVF is an ongoing process, it can be beneficial to engage in a regular practice that encourages you to be calm and relaxed. Both yoga and tai chi are daily activities that can help move your body and release stress. Connecting your mind and body can help you ease your stress.It\u2019s best to do these activities regularly and use them to combat and prevent stress and anxiety.\n Meditation can help with worry, anxiety, and stress by refocusing the brain and turning down the worries.While many people associate meditation with religion or spiritual practices, there\u2019s no need to focus on anything other than your own calm thoughts and feelings. Mindfulness meditation is a way to focus on tuning into specific things in order to bring awareness.When your mind is racing a million miles per minute on procedures and outcomes, slow down and spend a few moments in meditation.\n\n\nFor example, focus your attention solely on your breath. You can also focus on your senses: your sense of hearing, touch, taste, or vision.\n Women and men can experience depression differently. Women may tend to blame themselves, feel anxious, avoid conflicts, set poor boundaries, and turn to food for comfort.Some other common symptoms of depression include changes in appetite and sleeping, fatigue and low energy, feeling hopeless, and a loss of interest in pleasurable activities.\n\n\nFor more information on a diagnosis of depression, check out How to Know if You Have Depression.\n Don\u2019t let your existence melt into IVF. Allow yourself regular social contact with your loved ones and close friends. Being with friends is a great way to buffer feelings of depression and cope with depression symptoms. Even if you\u2019re not in the mood to go out or meet with friends, do it anyway. It may feel more comfortable at the time to retreat and isolate yourself, however, being around other people is healthier when dealing with depression.Schedule regular phone calls with family or weekly get-togethers with friends. Surrounding yourself in friendship can help lift the feelings of depression.\n One way to beat depression is to remove the focus on yourself for a little while and place it on someone else. Volunteering is an excellent way to connect to your community, combat stress and depression, increase happiness, and give you a sense of purpose. Especially during IVF, much of your focus is on you, your body, what could go wrong, waiting for results, and hoping things work out. Re-focus your attention one day a week on people in your community and feel good about the work you\u2019re doing.You may wish to work with children, such as working as a mentor for an after-school program or in a crisis nursery. You can also volunteer at an animal shelter, homeless shelter, or elderly home.\nCheck out How to Volunteer for more information.\n Some studies show that acupuncture can help with symptoms of depression.Acupuncture involves placing tiny, painless needles in specific points in your body for therapeutic purposes. It\u2019s a safe and non-prescription way to target symptoms of depression that will not affect IVF treatments, fertility, or pregnancy.\n\n\nAcupuncture may even help boost fertility."}

Sometimes, however, it is necessary to test resistance on components in circuit.\n Current flowing through a circuit will cause inaccurate readings, as the increased current will create a higher resistance. Also, the additional voltage could damage the multimeter. (For this reason, testing the resistance of a battery is not advised.)\n\n\nAny capacitors in a circuit being tested for resistance should be discharged before testing. Discharged capacitors may absorb charge from the multimeter's current, creating momentary fluctuations in the reading.\n Diodes conduct electricity in only 1 direction; thus, reversing the position of the multimeter's probes in a circuit with diodes will cause different readings.\n Some resistors or components need to be held in place to maintain contact with the multimeter's probes. Touching the resistor or the probe with your fingers can cause inaccurate readings due to your body absorbing current from the circuit. This is not a significant problem when using a low-voltage multimeter, but it can be a problem when testing resistance with a high-voltage multimeter.\n\n\nOne way to keep your hands off components is to attach them to a testing board, or \"breadboard\" when testing for resistance.

Only 16 states allow expungement of a conviction. The general public may not know about your expunged felony, but law enforcement agencies and courts still have access to that part of your record. If you\u2019re convicted of another crime after having a prior conviction expunged, the expunged conviction may add to the severity of your sentence. Most states don\u2019t allow expungement of serious, violent felonies. Some states do not allow you to expunge felonies at all. If you live in a state where this is true, you will have to work to get your felony reduced to a misdemeanor, and then you could possibly get that misdemeanor expunged.\nSome states allow the expungement of arrests only. If you live in a state like this, you might not be able to expunge felony or misdemeanor convictions at all.\nEven if you\u2019re successful in getting your conviction expunged, you may still have to disclose it in some instances, such as if you\u2019re applying for a professional license or a job in law enforcement. , Depending on the state, you might have to wait several years after your conviction before you can file to have your record expunged.\n\n\nThe length of time you have to wait can depend on several factors, including your age and the severity of the crime. Those factors vary from state to state.\nThe waiting period doesn\u2019t start until after you\u2019ve finished all aspects of your sentence. This includes successfully completing any probation period and paying all fines. , In many states you\u2019ll have to present police and court records about your felony when you file for expungement. You probably will have to pay fees for certified copies of those documents. You also will need copies of your criminal history and fingerprint records from the arresting police department. In some states, such as Florida, you also must have new fingerprints taken to submit with your expungement petition. , States have a form, typically called a Motion or Petition for Expungement, to be filed with the court. All you have to do is fill in the blanks. You should consider talking to a criminal defense attorney if you find the forms or process difficult or have problems obtaining the documents or related information. You may be able to talk to someone in the public defender\u2019s office or even the attorney who handled your case originally.\n After you\u2019ve finished filling them out, you need to file your forms with the proper court clerk. Some states also require you to serve the form to district attorneys or law enforcement agencies. If the state requires you to serve your expungement papers to law enforcement officials, understand that you cannot do this yourself. The clerk\u2019s office will have a list of local process-serving companies, and you\u2019ll have to use one of those.\nYou\u2019ll pay fees to file your expungement request, which usually amount to a few hundred dollars. If your state requires you to serve the forms, there will be fees for that service as well. These fees are nonrefundable. When the clerk stamps and files your petition, s/he will give you a docket number and schedule your hearing. , In some states judges hold expungement hearings, while others use parole boards. The hearing may be less formal than a trial, but you should treat it with the same respect. Dress neatly and conservatively, and arrive early with copies of all the documents you\u2019ve filed. The judge or parole board must decide if you\u2019ve been successfully rehabilitated, so you may be asked questions about your education, home and family life, financial health, physical well-being, and employment.\nPolice officers and district attorneys may attend your hearing to object to the expungement of your record.\nIf the judge grants your expungement, you need copies of the signed Expungement Order to deliver to law enforcement agencies. The clerk\u2019s office will let you know where to send them. If the judge denies your request for expungement, ask him/her to list the reasons for the denial and to explain what you can do in response. After a period of time, during which you resolve those issues, you may well be able to reapply for expungement. "}

For a fattier bacon, ask for meat that came from the hog\u2019s belly and/or chest. For a meatier bacon, ask for meat that covered the hog\u2019s spare ribs.Whole pork bellies typically weigh between 10 and 12 pounds, but if you are experimenting with cure recipes, ask for a smaller cut in case you end up not liking your concoction.;\n, If you purchased your pork belly from a commercial vendor other than a farm and plan on curing it as soon as you get home, skip this step, since the meat has already been chilled. But if you buy direct from a farm, ask the farmer how long ago the hog was slaughtered, because you need to chill your meat within 24 hours of that time.In either case, bring along a cooler stocked with ice to keep the pork belly relatively cool on the ride home if it takes you more than half an hour.Once home, place the pork belly in a sealable container to keep your fridge clean and prevent cross-contamination with other items.\nFor a quicker chill, set the container inside the fridge wherever it is coldest. To further reduce the chance of cross-contamination, set it in the meat compartment, away from other products.\nKeep the refrigerator\u2019s temperature at 40 degrees Fahrenheit and let the pork belly sit until its core temperature drops to 42 degrees, which will help kill bacteria.\nIf you are chilling multiple bellies, set each one in its own container rather than stacking the meat directly on top of each other.\n Either ask your butcher to do it for you when you purchase the meat, or do it at home yourself. In the latter case, use a sharpened knife since the skin is tough. Begin your cut at any corner of the belly. As you slice the skin off, angle the blade toward the skin, rather than away from it, so you don\u2019t end up trimming off any more precious meat than necessary. Once your skin is removed, the meat will absorb more of the cure.The discarded skin can be cooked on its own, either by grilling or deep-frying. If you wish to do this, be sure to tell your butcher to save the skin if you have them slice the skin off for you.\n Buy curing salts online if they aren't available at your local supermarket or butcher's. Or, mix your own using kosher salt and sodium nitrite, which is also available online. However, be aware that there has been debate about sodium nitrite (the principal preservative in curing salt) and its possible link to cancer and other diseases,due to its possible conversion into carcinogenic nitrosamines. Use celery powder or ground celery seeds as an alternative if this is a concern.Be aware, though, that such alternatives do contain sodium nitrate. There is also some debate about whether sodium nitrate is any healthier than sodium nitrite. The argument for using celery products is that the presence of certain vitamins and minerals is believed to prevent the conversion of nitrates into harmful nitrosamines.\n Exact recipes vary by personal taste and ingenuity. To cure 5 pounds of meat with a minimum of ingredients, first combine 1 cup of sugar with 2 tablespoons of blackstrap molasses in a bowl. Stir thoroughly. Then add 4 tablespoons of kosher salt, 2 teaspoons of curing salt, and 2 teaspoons of ground black pepper. Mix thoroughly, taste, and add more salt if desired.Even this basic recipe can be altered to suit your tastes by exploring the effects of different types of sugar, salt, and pepper., For roughly 5 pounds of meat, combine a \u00bd cup of kosher salt with 2 teaspoons of sodium nitrite. Mix in a \u00bc cup of brown sugar (either dark or light is fine). Then add \u215b cup of each of the following: ground black pepper, ground juniper berries, and crumbled sage. Finally, add 1 tablespoon of dried thyme. Stir all ingredients thoroughly for an even mix.\n\n\nBoth the sodium nitrite and juniper berries can be omitted if desired.\n For every 5 pounds of meat, combine a \u00bc cup of kosher salt with 2 teaspoons of pink curing salt. Then add a \u00bc cup of dark brown sugar. Next, add spices: 2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes, 2 tablespoons of smoked sweet paprika, and 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds. Lastly, pour a \u00bc cup of honey into the dry ingredients and stir them together until both wet and dry ingredients have been evenly mixed.Any honey will do, but chestnut honey works particularly well here.\n Remove your chilled pork belly from the fridge. To keep your kitchen surfaces clean, place it on a rimmed baking sheet. Coat the meat with your cure recipe. Then massage the cure into the meat all over,doing your best to spread the cure over and into the pork belly as evenly as you can for consistent flavor.\n Once it has been coated with cure, place the meat into a sealable container. If you use a plastic bag for this, set the bag in a rimmed baking sheet or a pan to keep any possible leaks from spreading in your fridge. Refrigerate the pork belly for at least 5 days. As juices begin to pool at the bottom of the container, be sure to flip the pork belly daily so each side is more or less evenly soaked in brine.If your meat is particularly thick, or you wish to have as much cured flavor as possible, leave the pork belly to cure for 7 days to ensure that the cure makes its way to the middle of the meat, thus extending its shelf life.\n Remove the pork belly from the fridge and its container. Place it in a colander. Run cold water over both sides to wash away all excess salt. Then use paper towels or a clean towel to gently pat the meat dry.Your bacon is now cured!\n\n, If you do not cook and consume your bacon right away, wrap it with plastic wrap. Seal it tightly to keep out air.Store in your refrigerator or freezer.\n\n\nBacon slabs cured with nitrites will last 4 to 6 weeks in the refrigerator and 3 months in the freezer.Bacon slabs cured without nitrites will last 3 weeks in the refrigerator and 6 months in the freezer.\n"}

Steel is especially good, since Ninetales takes quadruple the normal damage from it.\nBraviary is Normal/Flying-type, so use an Ice, Rock, or Electric type attack. Note that it has Tailwind, which doubles the speed of his entire team for 3 turns.\nMagnezone is Electric/Steel-type, so use a Fire, Fighting, or Ground type attack. Ground is especially good, since Magnezone takes quadruple the normal damage from it. It has the Sturdy ability, so you can't defeat it in one hit.\nSnorlax is Normal-type, so use a Fighting type attack.\nIncineroar is Fire/Dark-type, so use a Water, Ground, Fighting, or Rock type attack. It has the Firium Z, so it can use its Z-Move, Inferno Overdrive.\nPrimarina is Water/Fairy-type, so use a Grass, Electric, or Poison type attack. It has the Waterium Z, so it can use its Z-Move, Hydro Vortex.\nDecidueye is Grass/Ghost-type, so use a Fire, Flying, Ice, Ghost, or Dark type move.

Instead of a regular moisturizer, though, you want to use something that offers more intensive hydration. That\u2019s why it helps to apply an oil at least 24 hours before you plan to shave. You want to give the oil enough time to fully absorb into your skin.Make sure to use a rich oil, such as argan or olive oil. It\u2019s best not to use coconut oil because it\u2019s so lightweight that it absorbs too easily into the skin.\nThe oil that you apply may come off on your clothing, so be sure to wear an old shirt that you don\u2019t mind staining. You may prefer to apply the oil to your underarms before you go to sleep when you\u2019ll only be wearing pajamas.;\n, You probably shave whenever it\u2019s most convenient in your schedule, but choosing the right time to do can help you get a smoother shave. Shaving removes several of the skin\u2019s protective layers, so it may be more easily irritated and prone to infection afterward. Doing it at night is the better option because you can give your underarms time to calm down before you start applying deodorant and other personal care products in the morning.Shaving your underarms at night usually allows you to take more time with the process, which means you\u2019re less likely to rush and make a mistake.\nIf you notice that your underarms have a reaction to your deodorant, body spray, or perfume after shaving, it\u2019s especially important to shave at night when you don\u2019t use those types of products.\n Whenever you shave, it\u2019s a good idea to exfoliate first to remove dead skin cells. That helps bring the hair under your arms closer to the surface so you can get a closer shave. Use a mild exfoliating scrub or some body wash on a washcloth to gently exfoliate your underarms before shaving.When you\u2019re applying the exfoliator to your underarms, use circular motions, making sure to cover the entire area.\nIf you prefer natural body products, you can create your own body scrub for the under arms by mixing 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 teaspoon lemon water., Before you pick up a razor, it\u2019s important to dampen your underarms. Splashing them with warm water not only helps plump the skin, but it can actually help soften your underarm hair, so it\u2019s easier to cut. The easiest way to wet your underarms is to shave while you\u2019re taking a shower.Shave at the end of your shower. That gives the moisture and heat plenty of time to soften your skin and hair.\n While moisturizing your skin ahead of time can help give you a closer underarm shave, you\u2019ll need extra lubrication to ensure that the razor glides over the skin. Apply a moisturizing shave gel or cream to your underarm area. Because the shave gel helps the razor move easily across the skin, you need to use less force to cut the hair, which means you\u2019ll have less irritation.If your underarm area is prone to irritation, be sure to choose a shave gel or cream that\u2019s formulated specifically for sensitive skin.\n For the smoothest shave under your arms, you want a sharp razor, so be sure to change yours regularly. It also helps to use a razor that has multiple blades and a pivoting head when you want a close shave. Some razors are actually designed specifically for the underarms, so read the packaging carefully.To ensure that your razors are sharp and clean, replace them after every four or five uses.\nLook for a razor with a rubber handle that\u2019s easier to grip. That allows you to follow the contours of your underarm area more easily.\n When you\u2019re ready to move the razor over your underarm area, it helps to make the surface as smooth as possible. Try to pull the skin as tautly as you can, so there are no wrinkles or creases for the razor to skip over.It can be difficult to pull your skin taut when you only have one hand free as you\u2019re shaving. To pull the skin tighter, stretch the arm that you\u2019re shaving as far over your shoulder as you can.\n For the closest shave under your arm, it\u2019s important to move your razor in the right direction. Underarm hair doesn\u2019t grow in a single direction so you need to move the razor in multiple directions to get the smoothest shave. Start by working the razor in a downward motion over the underarm. Next, move the razor from one side of the underarm to the other.Be sure to move the razor as firmly as you can. If you use too light a hand, you can wind up slipping and cutting yourself.\nShaving against the grain of hair growth gets you the closest shave. However, if you have sensitive skin, you should avoid going against the grain because it can cause irritations.\n Each time you move the razor across your skin, it picks up shaving cream, hair, dead skin cells, and other debris. Leaving all of that on the blades can make it more difficult for the razor to cut the hair, so you don\u2019t get as close a shave as you\u2019d like. Rinse your razor with hot water after every stroke if possible.Shaving with a dirty razor can also spread bacteria, which may cause an infection or other irritation in your underarm area.\n Shaving your underarms can leave the skin tender and slightly irritated. The best way to help soothe and condition your skin is to apply a moisturizer after shaving. It\u2019s best to use an unscented body lotion or cream to prevent irritation. However, you can also use coconut oil if you prefer natural skin care products.Some deodorants contain moisturizing ingredients, such as avocado oil, sunflower seed oil, or glycerol, so you can eliminate the need for a separate moisturizer for your underarms.\nAvoid deodorants that contain harsh ingredients, such as alcohol or dyes. They can irritate your skin even if you use a moisturizer.\n If you\u2019re prone to ingrown hairs in the underarm area, try to prevent them before they happen. There are a variety of products designed specifically to fight ingrown hairs or razor bumps that you can apply after shaving. Typically, they contain exfoliating ingredients, such as salicylic or glycolic acid, that remove dead skin to prevent the hairs from becoming trapped beneath it.If you have sensitive skin, it\u2019s best not to use a leave-on product under your arms. Instead, use a body wash that contains salicylic acid on the area. You rinse it away, so it won\u2019t sit on your skin too long and irritate it.\n If your underarm area is bumpy and irritated after a shave, the clothes that you\u2019re wearing may be a factor. Tight shirts and dresses that are made of synthetic fabrics have a tendency to trap sweat and dirt, encouraging the growth of bacteria that leads to a rash or other irritations. Instead, opt for loose-fitting clothing made of breathable fabrics that allow air to circulate in the area.Breathable fabrics include cotton, linen, and chambray.\nMake sure to wash your underarm area every day to prevent the growth of bacteria.\n\n"}

Add 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) to both dimensions so that the final mounted curtain will not sit against the water heater itself.\n You'll need a special curtain rod that can be mounted to the ceiling, and the curtain rod track must suit the dimensions of your water heater area.

Use a power drill to fix these screws into the anchors already on your ceiling.\n\n\nThe screws used to attach the ceiling brackets must go through the center of each bracket and into the drywall anchor already mounted in the ceiling.\n Use the connector pieces that came with your curtain rod track to connect the individual track rods together.\n\n\nOn a flat working surface, line up the individual track pieces end-to-end.\nSlide the connector pieces into the tracks and snap in place.\nSlide the fitted plastic curtain gliders onto the track one at a time. If the curtain rod did not come with plastic gliders, you will need to buy some separately from a hardware store.\nAttach the end pieces to both ends of your connected track. Secure them in place using a small Allen wrench.\n Re-insert each track piece into the ceiling brackets previously mounted on the ceiling. Use a small Allen wrench to tighten the entire fixture.\n\n\nSpace apart the track pieces of the bracket structure so that they line up with the brackets on your ceiling.\nYou may need some assistance with this step.

You don't have to have your arm around her all the time or hold her hand 24/7 , but you should give her a loving touch or gesture when you're together often enough to make her feel loved to you. Here are some things you can do:\n\n\nIf you're at the movies or walking around, hold her hand for at least a part of it -- if she wants you to hold her hand.\nIf you're on the couch together, don't forget to snuggle or cuddle with her to make her feel special and loved.\nWhen taking photographs, you can put an arm around her to make her feel close to you for the photo\nIf you're talking and she's upset, put a hand on her knee, stroke her arm, or hold her hand to let her know you care about her.\nWhen you greet her and kiss her, run your hands through her hair or touch the back of her head slightly but not too much.\nDon't forget to touch her playfully. Picking her up, or just playfully swatting each other is a great way to show affection to each other.\n If you really want to make her feel loved, then you have to go beyond complimenting and touching her. You have to support her, whether it's by watching her soccer game or being there for her after the death of her grandmother or her mother. Love isn't always just fun and games and affection, and to really sweep her off her feet, you have to be part of the complete package and be there for her when she needs you with her.\n\n\nIf she's really into sports, be there to watch her games when you can, or at least don't forget to ask how it went for her sports games like baseball game,basketball game.\nIf she has a tough exam coming up, help her study, or support her by bringing her lunch or offering to do small favors for her while she studies for her exam.\nIf she's having a stressful week at work, take it easy on her. Help her relax by planning a stress-free night in and don't bring up any big questions right then and there.\n Sure, kissing her in the middle of a hot hook-up session will make her feel good, but it's the unexpected kisses that count the most. If you're just chatting in the middle of a date or having a nice stroll through a park, give her a kiss and say, \"I just had to kiss you right now. You look so pretty or beautiful right now.\" That will really impress her and she will want to kiss you too.\n\n\nAnd once you're kissing, make sure you give her a kiss every time you see her without making her feel neglected or a nobody.\nNot every kiss has to be a full-on French kiss. A gentle kiss on the lips is a great way to show you care about her and to mix things up right away.\n If you really want your girl to feel loved, then you have to make sure to plan dates and to stick to them. If you want to sweep her off her feet, then you can't just be Casanova for the first three weeks and then tell her that \"Sunday is sports day\" until the end of time. Make sure you have a weekly date night, no matter how stressed and tired you both are, and you'll continue to make your girl feel loved and cared about.\n\n\nRomance doesn't have to mean chocolate. It just means making time to show each other that you care about each other.\n If you want to make her feel loved, then you have to let her see that she's on your mind even if you're not together. Shoot her a text once a day to let her know you're thinking of her or about her,or send her an email from work with a link that made you think about her. Don't check in eight times a day unless you want to seem overbearing about it, but if you're started seriously dating, don't let a day go by without a quick phone call or a text.\n\n\nThough it's important to let her see how much you care when you're together, it's equally important for her to see that she's on your mind when you're apart.\n Though the big, grand gestures, like life-sized teddy bears or a diamond necklace can show her that you really care about her, all of the little things can add up, too. Though it may not be as glamorous to pick up a few groceries for her when she's in a pinch, to fix the broken table leg in her living room, or to go to the vet with her when her kitty is sick, these are the things that will make her think that wow, you really must care about her.\n\n\nOf course, she should do the little things for you, too. You don't have to become her errand boy to make her see that you really care about her.\n\n"}

Planting two crops that are not related and don't compete at the same time in the same place, in a pattern.\nSame crop but different varieties of it that mature at different times.;\n, These systems can be very complex but only if you know what you're doing and really, only if you need to do so for a commercial growing business. For home, keep it simple as suggested in the following steps.\n The success of succession gardening relies on knowing the growing times of each crop. Some plants are perennial (all year round in temperate zones) while other plants grow only part of the season, others require the whole season to grow, and some plants can be pushed hard into late autumn and winter. If you have mild winters, you can grow more crops than someone living in a place with harsh, snowed-in winters, so use your seasons wisely according to where you live; with harsher winters, you'll need to be more aware of early-cropping varieties that can be harvested before the frosts set in.\n This method should be done using a crop that reaches maturity in mid-summer, so that there is plenty of time to grow a crop that will thrive from mid-summer into autumn/fall.\n\n\nHarvest the crop and turn over the soil. Any plant material left behind can be incorporated into the soil unless it is diseased or mildewy, in which case it needs to be removed and consideration should be given to solarization of the soil.\nAdd some fertilizer. This could be well-rotted manure, compost, or whatever usual fertilizer you prefer.\nEven up the soil. Use a rake or similar to even it out.\nSprinkle seeds over the soil and pat in according to the instructions for the seed type. Pat down.\nWater the seeds. Germination should be fast as this is during the warm summer months. The weeds will also grow well, so be sure to remove them constantly.\n This method allows you to retrieve the crop at various stages of maturity. This is great for a continuous garden salad and it's ideal for those running a cafe or restaurant using homegrown foods. It works well for lettuce and other salad vegetables, many herbs, and so forth. Some plants not suitable for this method include peppers and tomatoes; anything that takes a long time to mature won't be such a good stagger crop.\n\n\nPlant some of the seed initially when its planting season starts.\nTwo weeks later, plant the next lot of seeds. And repeat this in two week lots.\nThin seedlings as specified for the particular plant.\nEnjoy the varied attention that the plants need; you will be dealing with them at different stages, so the work needed in the veggie patch will be varied, and therefore interesting and faster for each task.\n Incompatibilities, soil depletion, pathogens, and disease are possibilities when some plants are planted following others, so it is important to know what not to plant. For example, beans should not be followed by onions and garlic, and beans and onions should not be followed by tomatoes.\n\n"}

To make a pith ball electroscope you will need:\n\n\nA small piece of aluminum foil\nA foam cup\nAn aluminum pie plate\nA plastic straw\nHot glue or tape\nThread\nA balloon\nA foam plate\nA ruler\nScissors\n\n, Make two holes near the bottom of the cup on opposite sides and slide the straw into place. Position the straw so that three to four inches sticks out on one side of the cup.\n\n\nSecure the straw to the cup with tape or a little bit of glue.\nAvoid making the holes too large or ripping the base of the cup.\nIt\u2019s okay if the base of the cup has a hole in it as long as the straw is stable in its place.\n Turn the cup upside down so that the bottom of the cup is facing up. Tape or glue the top of the cup to the pie plate. Position the cup towards the edge of the pie plate so the straw sticks out over the edge.Make sure to secure the cup firmly to the bottom of the plate.\nUse caution when using hot glue as it is very hot and can cause burns.\n Measure and cut out a one-inch square of aluminum foil. Crumple it tightly into a spherical shape. Try to make it as evenly crumpled as possible so that it looks like a foil marble.The square does not need to be exactly 1-inch, it just needs to be a small marble-shaped aluminum ball.\n Cut a piece of thread long enough to hang the foil ball from the straw without it touching the table (about 2-3 inches should be enough). Tie the thread around the foil ball and knot it in place. Tape the other end of the thread to the end of the straw. The foil ball should hang straight down from the end of the straw.\n\n\nMake sure the foil ball hangs close to the edge of the pie pan, but does not touch it.\n Rub the foam plate against your hair or a rubber balloon to charge it with static electricity. Place the electroscope on top of the plate and observe what happens. The foil ball should move away from the pie plate. The foam plate transfers electrons to the pie plate and gives it a negative charge, repelling the foil ball away from it.When picking up or moving the electroscope, carry it by the foam cup. If you touch the pie plate, the charges will change and it will not work properly.\n\n"}

This is all the more reasons walking away is the best option often, to create the distance needed to cool down.\n\n\nIt's highly recommended that you learn to avoid getting yourself into situations that threaten fights as an inevitable outcome. Keep an eye out for danger signs, like the building up of high tension, the presence of alcohol, a too-late night, or somebody who is upset over something/somebody else already, and stay away. Attempt to defuse the situation as soon as it arises.;\n, The other person is likely as riled and angry or afraid as you are and this makes things volatile. By stepping back or standing away, you make the first call to not engage any further in fighting. Keep your distance\u2013\u2013if the other person comes closer, move away again.\n In many cases, the emotions are just too heightened for a discussion. However, if it seems that talking might work, throw some hooks as an invitation to talk instead of fight. For example: Say something like: \"Hey buddy. I don't want this. You don't want this. Let's be reasonable and talk it out.\"\n\n\nThis may not be the right time to work out the deepest, darkest motives of the other person. But it is a good opportunity to acknowledge his or her anger or frustration in ways that show you are paying full attention to their grievance.\nAvoid slinging shots, such as saying things like \"this is all your fault\", \"you're gutless\" or \"you think with your fist, not your brain\". These sorts of comments will just further inflame things.\n This is to be expected and you should be ready for it. You might hear yourself being called a coward, weak and all manner of angry and taunting things. These are the last offenses of the angry opponent who sees a chance for a fight deflating, the last ditch efforts to rile you into returning to the fight. Recognize them for what they are and don't personalize them.\n\n\nYou may hear taunts related to members of your family or other people you care about. Again, let it roll like water off the duck's back. Your opponent is trying all sorts of tactics and nobody's dignity is being maligned simply because this person says ridiculous things. Don't look on it as an issue of pride\u2013\u2013look on it as an issue of an idiot straining to provoke you.\n There may be principles you want to stand on, points you wish to ram home and views that you think are irrevocably right. You may think that your opponent is all wrong. But none of these beliefs are either wholly accurate or helpful to you. The important thing is avoiding a fight, not arguing petty points about the disagreement you two have.\n\n\nDon't insult your opponent or become angry with him or her. Just stay calm and do your best to convince him or her that a fight is a bad idea.\nIf necessary, acknowledge the other person has a valid argument for whatever it is that's instigating the fight, even if you're seemingly in the right. The rights and wrongs of the matter can be untangled later, when everyone has cooled down.\n Discuss the problem and apologize for anything you have caused, even if you're right. While attempting to defuse the situation, it is important to keep your hands in a defensible yet non-aggressive position. Moreover, prepare to defend yourself mentally just in case, as follows:\n\n\nBe ready to block sucker punches to your face/body, but not in a \"fighting stance\".\n\nUse the \"prayer position\" with both palms pressed together, which looks non-threatening, but keeps your hands up near your face.\nUse the \"stay back\" position, hands facing your aggressor palms outward.\nUse the \"I'm thinking\" position, with a hand on your chin/head. Remember; try to seem natural while you do this. Keep protected at all times.\n Remember there is no shame in running away\u2013\u2013you did your best. Walking away from a fight doesn't determine that you're a coward (no matter how much the other person screams this); it determines that you're mature and thinking responsibly, about not just yourself but about the other person too, and families and friends who will be affected by the repercussions. Above all, remind yourself the alternatives could be much worse: You could die, get crippled, or end in jail. Remember what's important to you and how a fight could impact your life.\n If the other person is very angry, they may simply attack you from behind. When walking away, face the person who is causing your trouble, to prevent them from attacking you from behind, sight unseen. Back away, keep an eye on the person and only turn to actually leave when it is safe to do so, such as in the doorway or getting into your car, etc.\n\n\nGlance back now and then while seeking to defuse the situation, to check for potential escape routes. Do not turn your head as you look back.\n\n"}

The first step is to set up the problem in the proper format.Write down the number whose cube root you want to find. Write the digits in groups of three, using the decimal point as your starting place. For this example, you will find the cube root of 10. Write this as 10. 000 000. The extra 0s are to allow precision in the solution.\n\nDraw a cube root radical sign over the number. This serves the same purpose as the long division bar line. The only difference is the shape of the symbol.\n\nPlace a decimal point above the bar line, directly above the decimal point in the original number.\n;\n, You will use these in the computations. These cubes are as follows:\n\n\n13=1\u22171\u22171=1{\\displaystyle 1^{3}=1*1*1=1}\n\n\n23=2\u22172\u22172=8{\\displaystyle 2^{3}=2*2*2=8}\n\n\n33=3\u22173\u22173=27{\\displaystyle 3^{3}=3*3*3=27}\n\n\n43=4\u22174\u22174=64{\\displaystyle 4^{3}=4*4*4=64}\n\n\n53=5\u22175\u22175=125{\\displaystyle 5^{3}=5*5*5=125}\n\n\n63=6\u22176\u22176=216{\\displaystyle 6^{3}=6*6*6=216}\n\n\n73=7\u22177\u22177=343{\\displaystyle 7^{3}=7*7*7=343}\n\n\n83=8\u22178\u22178=512{\\displaystyle 8^{3}=8*8*8=512}\n\n\n93=9\u22179\u22179=729{\\displaystyle 9^{3}=9*9*9=729}\n\n\n103=10\u221710\u221710=1000{\\displaystyle 10^{3}=10*10*10=1000}\n\n\n, Select a number that, when cubed, gives the largest possible result less than the first set of three numbers.In this example, the first set of three numbers is 10. Find the largest perfect cube that is less than 10. That number is 8, and its cube root is 2. \n\nWrite the number 2 above the radical bar line, over the number 10. Write the value of 23{\\displaystyle 2^{3}}, which is 8, underneath the number 10, draw a line and subtract, just as you would in long division. The result is a 2.\n\nAfter the subtraction, you have the first digit of your solution. You need to decide if this one digit is a precise enough result. In most cases, it will not be. You can check by cubing the single digit and decide if that is close enough to the result you wanted. Here, because 23{\\displaystyle 2^{3}} is only 8, not very close to 10, you should continue.\n Copy down the next group of three numbers into the remainder, and draw a small vertical line to the left of the resulting number. This will be the base number for finding the next digit in the solution of your cube root. In this example, this should be the number 2000, which is formed from the remainder 2 of the prior subtraction, with the group of three 0s that you pull down.To the left of the vertical line, you will be solving the next divisor, as the sum of three separate numbers. Draw the spaces for these numbers by making three blank underlines, with plus symbols between them. \n\n\n, For the first part of the divisor, write down three hundred times the square of whatever is on top of the radical sign. In this case, the number on top is 2, 2^2 is 4, and 4*300=1200. So write 1200 in the first space. The divisor for this step of the solution will be 1200, plus something that you will find next., Find the next digit of your solution by selecting what you can multiply by the divisor, 1200-something, to then subtract from the remainder of 2000. This can only be 1, since 2 times 1200 would be 2400, which is greater than 2000. Write the number 1 in the next space above the radical sign., The divisor for this step of the solution is made up of three parts. The first part is the 1200 that you already have. You need to add two more terms to that to complete the divisor.Now calculate 3 times 10 times each of the two digits that are in your solution above the radical sign. For this sample problem, that means 3*10*2*1, which is 60. Add this to the 1200 that you already have to make 1260.\n\nFinally, add the square of the last digit. For this example, that is a 1, and 1^2 is still 1. The total divisor is, therefore 1200+60+1, or 1261. Write this to the left of the vertical line.\n Complete this round of the solution by multiplying the last digit of your solution - in this case, the number 1 - times the divisor you just calculated, 1261. 1*1261 =1261. Write this under the 2000, and subtract, to give 739.\n After you complete the subtraction portion of each step, you need to consider whether your answer is precise enough. For the cube root of 10, after the first subtraction, your cube root was just 2, which is not very precise. Now, after a second round, the solution is 2.1.You can check the precision of this result by cubing 2.1*2.1*2.1. The result is 9.261. \n\nIf you believe your result is precise enough, you can quit. If you want a more precise answer, then you need to proceed with another round.\n In this case, for more practice and a more precise answer, repeat the steps for another round, as follows:Drop down the next group of three digits. In this case, these are three 0s, which will follow the 739 remainder to give 739,000.\n\nBegin the divisor with 300 times the square of the number currently above the radical line. This is 300\u2217212{\\displaystyle 300*21^{2}}, which is 132,300.\n\nSelect the next digit of your solution so that you can multiply it by 132,300 and have less than the 739,000 of your remainder. A good choice would be 5, since 5*132,300=661,500. Write the digit 5 in the next space above the radical line.\n\nFind 3 times the prior number above the radical line, 21, times the last digit you just wrote, 5, times 10. This gives 3\u221721\u22175\u221710=3,150{\\displaystyle 3*21*5*10=3,150}.\n\nFinally, square the last digit. This is 52=25.{\\displaystyle 5^{2}=25.}\n\nAdd the parts of your divisor to get 132,300+3,150+25=135,475.\n After you have calculated the divisor for this next round and you have expanded your solution by one more digit, proceed as follows:\n\nMultiply the divisor by the last digit of your solution. 135475*5=677,375.\n\nSubtract. 739,000-677,375=61,625.\n\nConsider whether the solution of 2.15 is precise enough. Cube it to get 2.15\u22172.15\u22172.15=9.94{\\displaystyle 2.15*2.15*2.15=9.94}.\n The result above the radical is the cube root, accurate at this point to three significant figures. In this example, the cube root of 10 is 2.15. Verify that by calculating 2.15^3=9.94, which approximates 10. If you need greater accuracy, simply continue the process as long as you desire.\n If you are asked for a cube root of nearly any number, begin by selecting a perfect cube that is as near as possible, without exceeding your target number.\n\nFor example, if you want to find the cube root of 600, recall (or use a table of cube numbers) that 83=512{\\displaystyle 8^{3}=512} and 93=729{\\displaystyle 9^{3}=729}. Therefore, the solution for the cube root of 600 must be something between 8 and 9. You will use the numbers 512 and 729 as upper and lower boundaries for your solution.\n The first digit came from your knowledge of certain cube numbers. For the next digit, estimate some number between 0 and 9 based on where your target number falls between the two boundary numbers.\n\nIn the working example, the target of 600 falls about halfway between the boundary numbers of 512 and 729. So, select 5 for your next digit.\n Try multiplying out the estimate that you are currently working with to see how close you get to the target number.\n\nIn this example, multiply 8.5\u22178.5\u22178.5=614.1.{\\displaystyle 8.5*8.5*8.5=614.1.}\n\n\n, After cubing your last estimate, check where the result falls in comparison to your target number. If the result is over the target, you will need to drop your estimate by one or more. If the result is below the target, you may need to adjust upward until you exceed the target.\n\nFor example, in this problem, 8.53{\\displaystyle 8.5^{3}} is greater than the target of 600. So you should reduce the estimate to 8.4. Cube this number and compare to your target. You will find that 8.4\u22178.4\u22178.4=592.7{\\displaystyle 8.4*8.4*8.4=592.7}. This is now lower than your target. Therefore, you know that the cube root of 600 must be at least 8.4 but less than 8.5.\n You will continue this process of estimating digits from 0 to 9 until your answer is as precise as you want it to be. For each round of estimating, begin by noting how where your latest calculation falls between the boundary numbers.\n\nIn this working example, your last round of calculations shows that 8.43=592.7{\\displaystyle 8.4^{3}=592.7}, while 8.53=614.1{\\displaystyle 8.5^{3}=614.1}. The target of 600 is slightly closer to 592 than it is to 614. So for your next guess, begin by choosing a number slightly less than halfway between 0 and 9. A good guess would be 4, for a cube root estimate of 8.44.\n As many times as necessary, cube your estimate and see how it compares to your target. You want to find the numbers that are just below and just above the target number.\n\nFor this working example, begin by finding that 8.44\u22178.44\u22178.44=601.2{\\displaystyle 8.44*8.44*8.44=601.2}. This is just barely above the target, so drop down and test 8.43. This will give you 8.43\u22178.43\u22178.43=599.07{\\displaystyle 8.43*8.43*8.43=599.07}. Therefore, you know that the cube root of 600 is something more than 8.43 and less than 8.44.\n Continue the steps of estimating, comparing and re-estimating as long as necessary, until your solution is as precise as you desire. Notice that with each decimal place, your target numbers will be getting closer and closer to the actual number.\n\nFor the example of the cube root of 600, when you used two decimal places, 8.43, you were away from the target by less than 1. If you continue to a third decimal place, you would find that 8.4343=599.93{\\displaystyle 8.434^{3}=599.93}, less than 0.1 from the true answer.\n To understand why this algorithm works for finding cube roots, you first need to recall what the cubic expansion looks like for a binomial. You probably learned this in Algebra or Algebra II in high school (and, if you\u2019re like most people, probably forgot it soon after). Select two variables A{\\displaystyle A} and B{\\displaystyle B} to represent single digit numbers. Then create the binomial of (10A+B){\\displaystyle (10A+B)} to represent a two digit number.Using the term 10A{\\displaystyle 10A} is what creates a two digit number. Whatever digit you select for A{\\displaystyle A}, 10A{\\displaystyle 10A} will put that digit into the tens column. For example, if A{\\displaystyle A} is 2 and B{\\displaystyle B} is 6, then (10A+B){\\displaystyle (10A+B)} becomes 26., We are working backward here, by creating the cube first, to then see why the solution for cube roots works. We need to find the value of (10A+B)3{\\displaystyle (10A+B)^{3}}. You do this by multiplying out (10A+B)\u2217(10A+B)\u2217(10A+B){\\displaystyle (10A+B)*(10A+B)*(10A+B)}. This is too lengthy to show right here, but the end result is 1000A3+300A2B+30AB2+B3{\\displaystyle 1000A^{3}+300A^{2}B+30AB^{2}+B^{3}}.For more about expanding the binomial to get this result, you can see Multiply Binomials. For a more advanced, shortcut version, read Calculate (x+y)^n with Pascal's Triangle.\n Notice that the method for calculating the cube root works like long division. In long division, you find two factors that multiply together to give the product of the number you begin with. In the calculation here, the number you are solving for (the number that winds up on top of the radical sign) is the cube root. That means that it represents the (10A+B) term. The actual A and B are irrelevant for now, as long as you just recognize the relationship to the answer., When you look at the expanded polynomial, you can see why the cube root algorithm works. Recognize that the divisor of each step of the algorithm is the sum of four terms that you need to calculate and add together. These terms come about as follows:The first term contains a multiple of 1000. You first a number that could be cubed and stay within the range for the long division for the first digit. This provides the term 1000A^3 in the binomial expansion.\n\nThe second term of the binomial expansion has the coefficient of 300. (This actually comes from 3\u2217102{\\displaystyle 3*10^{2}}.) Recall that in the cube root calculation, the first digit in each step is multiplied by 300.\n\nThe second digit in each step of the cube root calculation comes from the third term of the binomial expansion. In the binomial expansion, you can see the term 30AB^2.\n\nThe final digit of each step is the term B^3.\n As you perform the long division algorithm, each step that you complete provides more precision for your answer. For example, the sample problem worked in this article is to find the cube root of 10. In the first step, the solution is just 2, because 23{\\displaystyle 2^{3}} is close, but less than 10. In fact, 23=8{\\displaystyle 2^{3}=8}. After a second round, you get the solution of 2.1. When you work this out, 2.13=9.261{\\displaystyle 2.1^{3}=9.261}, which is much closer to the desired value of 10. After a third round, you have 2.15, which gives 2.153=9.94{\\displaystyle 2.15^{3}=9.94}. You can keep working in groups of three digits to get as precise an answer as you need."}

Although your memory will supply much of the material, documents from your past might provide further information or insights. Talk with your friends or family members about any materials that might be useful, such as pictures, government documents, or family papers.Some examples of important documents might be your birth certificate, photographs or videos of you, correspondence (letters and emails) with other people, and old social media posts.\n Talking to the various people in your life is another excellent way to find information to include in your history. Your family members will be particularly valuable sources since they have known you the longest. Be sure to record the interviews for later use.Many cellphones have a recording function that will help you save your interviews.\n Once you have conducted your interviews and gathered your materials, you will want to begin reviewing them. Read through the documents you have collected to find important pieces of information that you would like to include in your history. Listen to the recordings or read the transcripts of the interviews you conducted. Use a notebook or word processor to keep track of this information for later use.Try creating a spreadsheet that lists all of the sources that you would like to use. This will help you find them quickly and not lose them.\n Once you have all of your documentation, you will want to begin thinking about how you would like to organize your history.Ask yourself what events you would like to highlight and which are less important. Determine whether you would like to write about your entire life or a specific period. Answering these questions will help you get a better idea of how to organize your story.You can organize your story thematically to emphasize important interests or life lessons. For example, if you want to highlight your skills as an athlete, you may only mention the life events that are relevant to that subject.\nYou can also chronologically format your history to tell a sequential story. Start with the earliest relevant event and move forward in time from there.\nUltimately, it is up to you how you organize your story, find a style that makes sense and tells your history.\n Once you have a structure for your history, you will want to begin writing it. Initially, this can be an intimidating prospect. In order to make the process of writing your personal history more manageable, try to write a little every day. If you focus on achieving small goals, over time you will finish your history.Try setting a timer for 45 minutes and write until it goes off. Then, take a 15 minute break and start writing again once those 15 minutes are up. Repeat this process as long as you feel fresh and engaged in your writing.\nFind a writing schedule that works best for you., When you have finished writing your history, you will want to edit it. Initially, read it yourself to clean up any typos or errors in the writing. After you have given it a glance, find someone to edit it further. This can be anyone who you trust to do a thorough job of editing. If the story has any juicy details, it should also be someone who you feel comfortable reading it. Although you do not have to accept their edits, it is important to give them a good consideration.If you are publishing your personal history, you will have to work with an editor to get your manuscript ready for publishing. In this circumstance, the editor\u2019s comments often need to be addressed in the manuscript.\n\n"}

Create a command that you will use to signal to your dog it's time to go. Something like, \"Go potty\" should be sufficient.

Scolding your dog after he's eliminated inside or confining him to his crate as punishment will not help. It will only create a stressful situation for the dog that might make accidents more frequent. If you catch your dog in the act, clap your hands fast and say \"No!\" and then take him outside. However, never punish a dog after an accident has occurred. Dogs live in the immediate moment as they might be confused as to why they're in trouble., If your dog does have an accident indoors, clean up the area thoroughly.

If you have time to grab any additional survival items, do so. But only if doing so won't endanger your life or the lives of others.\n\nIf you have time, put on all your waterproof gear, such as headgear, jacket, and gloves.If there is an emergency survival suit available and time permits, put it on. Note that while survival suits increase your chances of surviving in cold water, they are unlikely to be provided on passenger ships. For crew who have access to such suits, they will usually be required to practice putting on this suit within 2 minutes.\nAttend to all infants, children, and pets after you've prepared yourself.\n This may be the most important step of all. If you don't know how to get to safety, the captain or one of the crew members will tell you how. Ship's crews are highly trained in rescue operations on many ships and will have a better understanding than you about what needs to be done to ensure your safety. You should only attempt to escape on your own if there is no authority present to give proper directions. A well-run ship will have a \"muster station\" where everyone needs to gather in preparation for evacuation. If you received a safety drill in going to a muster station, try to comply with it.\n\n\nIf you can't hear or understand the directions (for example, it's not your language), keep one thing in mind - head up and off the ship. Heading to the center or inner levels of the boat is not wise but don't be surprised if people do this as a result of panic.\nIf the captain assigns you with tasks, speak up if you don't feel you can comply. Otherwise, do your best to help out.\n It may sound like an inevitable clich\u00e9, but the more you panic, the longer it will take to get to a lifeboat. Studies have shown that only about 15 percent of people manage not to panic, with a whopping 70 percent suffering from impaired reasoning and 15 percent becoming irrational.Thus, staying calm is important for dealing with other passengers as well as helping to keep your own mind focused to do whatever you can to survive. If others around you are panicking, try as best you can to calm them down, as their actions will only slow down and possibly endanger your evacuation. Unfortunately, panic on a cruise is something that can endanger everyone owing to the amount of people involved and this can lead people to push and shove one another, causing injuries before people have even left the ship.Be aware that the opposite spectrum of panic can kick in \u2013 that of being stunned and unable to respond at all.If you see someone frozen with fear, yell at them. This is what flight attendants are trained to do to get passengers to leave a burning plane, and can be adapted to a boat situation.\nTry to focus on keeping your breathing under control. If you're used to breathing for yoga, pilates, or any similar relaxation breathing techniques, use these to calm you, as well as resorting to breathing this way if you end up in the water trying to survive., Getting out fast is more important that getting out by going the shortest way which might even lead you to more danger. As the ship begins to tilt, grab whatever you can to help you remain upright and able to reach your destination, such as handrails, pipes, hooks, light fittings, etc.\n\n\nDo not take the elevator. Just as you should avoid elevators when escaping a fire, the same applies here; all electrically driven items are suspect. The last place you'll want to be on a sinking ship is stranded in an elevator, so only use it as a last resort if the stairs are flooded.\nWhile still in the inner deck areas, watch for catapulting or floating objects coming your way. Large items hitting you can knock you unconscious or kill you.\n Most of today's cruise liners run safety drills and procedures prior to departing on voyages so that passengers know where to go in the event of an emergency. If not, head to where it seems that the crew are assisting passengers to escape. Crew will usually be the last to abandon ship, as it is their duty to get everyone else off the ship to possible safety first.\n\n\nDon't play the hero by staying back while crew is on board. Do what needs to be done to ensure that survival of yourself and your loved ones is not compromised. This isn't the movies.\n The very best scenario is to enter a lifeboat without getting wet. The moment you're wet, you risk getting hypothermia or suffering from cold shock (see below). If lifeboats are already deployed, head for the best place to enter or jump into them, following instructions of crew if relevant.\n\n\nIf there are no lifeboats available, try to find a life preserver ring or similar flotation device and toss it into the water. Any flotation device is better than none, although your survival chances decrease dramatically once you're forced to spend time in the water.\nYou may need to jump off the ship, or in some cases, simply step off an incline. If there is a lifeboat nearby, swim to it, wave your arms, and shout to attract attention.\nIf jumping, always look first. There may be people, boats, fires, propellers, etc., in the water below that you could hit or be submerged in. The ideal scenario is getting straight into a lifeboat. If not, the next best scenario is to jump as close to a rescue boat as possible and make your way into it immediately.\n Waiting alone in the open ocean without the comfort of a large ship will undoubtedly be frightening, but be patient. Help is on the way.\n\n\nIn a lifeboat, use rations sparingly. Use flares only when it is clear that doing so will result in a rescuer seeing you. Huddle together to keep warm. Arrange lookout watches. Collect rainwater and don't drink seawater or urine. Treat any injuries as best you can.Stay determined. Stories of survivors at sea are a testament that it is the most determined who survive harsh waiting conditions leading up to rescue.\nIf you couldn't find a lifeboat, look for the next best things, such as a life raft, or bobbing objects from the ship (flotsam) that remain afloat.\n If you don't end up in a lifeboat either straight away or fairly quickly, your survival odds worsen a great deal. The sea is cold and if it's rough, even the strongest swimmers will have a hard time defeating the cold and the sea swells. Inadequate amounts of lifeboats or lost lifeboats mean that there can be more people than space, causing more panic and even endangering the remaining lifeboats as people desperately cling to them or clamber on.\n\n\nBeing in cold water will cause hypothermia. Hypothermia will cause you to want to sleep. If you fall asleep or fall unconscious, you risk drowning.\nCold shock is the kind of shock that comes from hitting cold water and being unable to control your breathing while your heart rate and blood pressure go up, immediately incapacitating you.Cold shock can cause you to take an involuntary breath, which will often cause you to take in water.While those who are used to entering cold water can tolerate this for initial few minutes required to regain your senses, many people are not able to do so and drown. This cold shock phenomenon occurs before hypothermia sets in.\nShock may set in, causing everything to become surreal and to prevent you from doing your best to survive. If shock doesn't set in, mental distress is a highly likely possibility, with nothing but water everywhere, right to the horizon, and not knowing when rescue will arrive. Try to prevent this by focusing on surviving, using mind games, counting, thinking about other people's needs, etc.\nYour hands and fingers will become numb very quickly, making even doing up a lifejacket difficult, if not impossible.\nEven in good weather, heatstroke, sunburn, and dehydration soon become an issue. Try to cover yourself up as best you can and ration water supplies carefully.\nIf you do survive, be ready for the reality that some of the people on the lifeboat with you may not. Seek counseling for post-traumatic stress disorder if needed.\n\n"}
{"title": "How to Be a Good Observer2", "summary": "improve your memory.\neliminate distractions.\nkeep a field journal.\nform connections between what you see.\nmeditate.", "article": " Part of being a good observer is remembering details. This includes remembering everything from locking your door before you leave your house to the color of the car you parked beside. Since our brains filter a lot of that irrelevant information out, make a conscious effort to start committing simple details to memory. It will help you improve your memory while making you a better observer of your surroundings.\n\n\nAs you leave your house, tell yourself, \"I turned off the stove. I locked the door.\" This will help you commit it to memory. This technique also helps you start observing small, every day tasks.Use memory games like concentration. The memory skills you want to develop for strengthening observation skills are the ones connected to the senses. Sight is especially important. Show yourself pictures, then close your eyes and try to remember what you observed in the photo. Walk through the city and remembering what you smelled. Try to replay conversations from the day each evening to see how much of the dialog you can remember word for word.\n One reason that people are not as observant as they should be is because they are distracted. Cell phones, music, a to-do list - there are a lot of reasons why people are distracted daily. Try getting rid of distractions so you can focus on your surroundings.Remove your headphones when you walk or are on the train. Listen to the sounds around you, including conversations. Don't just look at the objects around you, consciously observe them. By not being distracted, you will be aware of everything around you and remember it more easily.\nFocus on the television show or movie you are watching and listen closely to songs. Instead of mindlessly watching or listening, pay attention to them. Think about costuming choices in the show or movie, or why the director chose a particular way to set up a shot. Look at the props, especially the background, and see what you can observe and deduce about the characters, themes, or plot. Try to figure out the meaning of song lyrics as you listen., Observation is a very scientific approach to the world. By keeping a field journal, you are recording your observations. This can be about anything; the important thing is to observe everything around you and strengthen your observation skills.\n\n\nStart by going to a park with a notebook. Jot down what you see around you. Make sure to note specifics, like the color of the shirts people are wearing, the birds flying overhead, the sounds. Begin trying to figure out what are important details and which details are not as important.\nUse this field observation in other aspects of your life. How many times does the guy in the cubicle next to you get up to talk on his cell during the day? How many times does a customer pick up an item before they buy it? What color shirt do most people wear on the bus?\nTake these observations and begin to draw conclusions. For examples, customers don't pick up food items multiple times before buying them; they pick them up and set them on the counter. Customers pick up beauty products five times before making a decision to buy it. Your boss always wears a blue shirt on Mondays, and green shirt on Thursdays.Use this journal to outline irregularities in your day. Think about irregular sounds or events that happen around you. Being a good observer means being able to pick out things that are out of the ordinary., Part of observing is coming to conclusions. Practice observing the world and analyzing what that means. Don't just observe without doing anything with the information.\n\n\nIf you see a frazzled mother in a store with her teenage daughter, then spot college brochures inside her purse, you can come to the conclusion that she is stressed because her daughter is about to go to college.\nIf you see a man with a stain on his shirt, and then see the car seat in his backseat, you can conclude that the stain was a baby-related accident.\n Meditation is a great exercise for strengthening observation skills. It helps you clear your mind of clutter and distractions so you can focus.\n\n\nSpend 10-15 minutes a day relaxing. Get in a quiet room, or turn on quiet instrumental music. Breathe in and out and push all thought from your mind. Focus on everything around you, like the sounds and the smells."}

Treat that area as a single wire with resistance equal to the value you found.\n\nIn the example above, you can ignore the two branches and treat them as one resistor with resistance 1.875\u03a9.\n Once you've replaced each parallel section with a single resistance, your diagram should be a single loop: a series circuit. The total resistance of a series circuit is equal to the sum of all individual resistances, so just add them up to get your answer.\n\nThe simplified diagram has a 1 \u03a9 resistor, 1.5 \u03a9 resistor, and the section with 1.875 \u03a9 you just calculated. These are all connected in series, so RT=1+1.5+1.875=4.375{\\displaystyle R_{T}=1+1.5+1.875=4.375}\u03a9.\n If you do not know the resistance in one component of your circuit, look for ways to calculate it. If you know the voltage V and current I across that component, find its resistance using Ohm's Law: R = V / I.\n"}

Go slowly so your circle stays even.;\n, On the back side of the leather, use a fabric pen to trace around your cardboard circle. Trace the circle twice, as these shapes will be your earrings.When selecting your leather, choose a color or pattern you like. If you want earrings for a red outfit, for example, use red leather.\n Use fabric scissors to carefully cut around each circle. Go slowly. You do not want to cut uneven circles for your earrings. This will make your final product look sloppy., Take a small hole puncher. Use it to punch two holes in either earring, near the top of your circles. This is so the circles will dangle downward when you put the hoops in.Use the smallest hole puncher possible. It's not necessary to have very large holes in your earrings.\n You can buy earring hooks at most craft stores. You will have to use pliers or your fingers to gently twist open the loop at the end of the hook. Fit the hook through the holes you made in each earring.Once you've fitted the loop through the hook, use your pliers or fingers to close the hook again.\nMake sure you close the hook completely.

You need to use a girth that fastens with the girth buckles just below the appropriate position during the break in period (one or two holes below the middle billet hole on both near and far side).;\n, New leathers are rough on saddle flaps that are not yet broken in to accommodate them.\n Wait for a day of steady rain. Not a downpour, and light mist won't do the trick. It's best to buy your saddle in the summer when the temperatures are such that you will be able to completely break in the saddle with one ride.\n Do not wear a raincoat that covers any portion of the saddle.\n During this ride, pay very close attention to your equitation, in particular your leg position and seat. It is helpful to have a friend who watches you and corrects ANY deviation. Start with your stirrups adjusted into the position you most commonly ride in. Shorten or lengthen your stirrups into the other lengths you use once your saddle is thoroughly saturated. Ride equal time in all positions after the saddle is softened by the rain.\n The billets stretch most during the first ride.\n Seal the exposed leather with a coat of glycerin. Dip a bar of glycerin into water and use a dry cloth to pick up a patch of it. There should be NO bubbles! Coat the top of the saddle fairly thickly and turn over. BE SURE THAT YOU ARE USING PURE GLYCERIN. Many soaps contain basic (high pH) additives that will damage the leather; leather is naturally slightly acidic due to the tanning process.\n Use warm neatsfoot oil on the lower flaps (those in contact with the horse), taking care not to oil the side in contact with the horse. Do not oil any stitching. Oil in extremely thin coats, using a soft cloth or sponge. Repeat until the oil does not soak into the leather, then wipe off any excess and allow to set for at least 24 hours. Oil will soak into the leather over time, and may accept more oil after setting. DO NOT OVER OIL THE LEATHER. If it is over-oiled, it will become too soft and delicate, which will decrease the life of the leather. It is not recommended to oil soft leather at any point, including, in some cases, the knee rolls, blocks, and often the seat of the saddle. It is possible, if desired, to lightly oil the smooth side of hard leather on the skirt and upper flaps. Oiling the smooth side takes far longer, but it makes it easier to control the evenness and amount of oil used.\n Alternatively, it is possible to lightly oil the billets, following the same instructions as those for the saddle flaps and skirt.\n The leather should be darker, softer and shinier than when new.\n Continue to closely monitor your leg placement during the first few weeks of service. Check your girth very frequently and use a shorter one when billets stretch and the buckles get too high on them.\n\n"}

You may substitute 1\u20133 tsp (5\u201315 mL) ground ginger according to taste.\n1 tsp (5 mL) dried mango powder (amchoor), available in South Asian grocery stores\n\n, If you prefer a sweeter dish, you may add 3 tbsp (45 mL) grated coconut, and 2 tsps (30 mL) sugar of any kind.Other optional ingredients are listed with suggested amounts in the ingredients section, but read the following descriptions before you decide to add them:\n\n\nCilantro, also known as coriander, tastes like soap to people with a certain gene, making it a controversial ingredient.Fenugreek, or methi, is often used in Indian cooking, but often has a strong, bitter aroma and taste. Taste it before using in your dish if you are not familiar with it.\nGaram masala is a spice mix that varies greatly, depending who makes it. Taste it first or read the ingredients. Typically, it contains at least cinnamon, clove, pepper, and cardamom.\n Wash the okra while rubbing its skin, then wipe dry with a clean towel. Leaving the okra wet may cause the vegetable to become slimier. Cooks disagree over whether this slimy texture is reduced or increased if you wash it in advance, rather than directly before cooking.Select small okra pods if possible, as these are more tender and flavorful.\n Remove the pointed tips from each end of the okra. Cut a slit lengthwise in the okra, stopping about 1/4 in (6 mm) from one end. Gently pry apart the okra enough to reveal the seeds and opening inside, without breaking it in half.\n Spoon the stuffing into the okra pods, filling them completely. If you have leftover stuffing, set it aside for later.\n Add enough oil to cover the base of a pan or skillet. Heat on medium heat until an okra seed dropped it in sizzles. Ideally, avoid pans made from iron, copper, or brass, which may turn the okra skin black. Steel, enamel, or nonstick surfaces are all unlikely to cause this problem.\n\n\nYou may use any type of oil, but oil with a medium or high smoking point is less likely to burn. Canola oil and peanut oil are examples of oils with high smoking points., Reduce the heat to low to avoid burning the masala stuffing, then add the stuffed okra to the pan. Stir the ingredients occasionally, turning the okra over once the cooked side become dark green. This typically takes about 5\u20136 minutes on each side. It may take less time if you cover the pan, but the trapped moisture may cause the okra to become slimy, which many people do not enjoy.\n\n\nIf you have leftover masala, you may add it after the other ingredients have cooked for two or three minutes.\n Stuffed bhindi can be a side dish to a large meal, or the main entre\u00e9. It is often served with South Asian bread, such as roti or chapati.Raita or yogurt is commonly served with it as well, to balance out the spicy flavor.\n\n"}

Keep this in mind when you are deciding between a loose salt mix that you scatter in your horse\u2019s feed or his stall and a salt block you hang in his stall.Some horses can also overindulge in salt if they have access to a salt block. As a horse owner, you have less control over how much salt your horse consumes when you give him a salt block. However, a salt block requires less maintenance and often horses will regulate their own salt intake when they have access to a salt block., Use mineralized salt if your horse\u2019s feed does not contain any minerals or if you are not giving him a vitamin/mineral supplement. If you do use feed or a concentrate with minerals or a vitamin/mineral supplement, you can use plain, white salt.To make your own salt block, you will need:14 lbs of table salt, iodized salt, or mineralized salt.\n3.3 lbs bone meal.\n1.3 lbs lime.\n3.5 lbs clay.\nWater.\nA large bowl or tub.\nA large wooden spoon or stick.\nOld pots and pans.\nAvoid adding a sweetener, like molasses, to your salt blocks. Horses can consume too much of the molasses salt block at once due to the sweet taste and this can lead to health issues.\n Add enough water so the texture becomes soft and easier to mix together. Use the large wooden spoon or stick to mix the ingredients until they are well blended.You should continue to add water so it is easy to stir and blend the ingredients but do not add too much water as you do not want the mixture to become watery. The mixture will have the right consistency when you can easily stir and blend the mixture with the wooden spoon or stick.\n Once you feel the mixture has been thoroughly mixed, drain as much water as possible from the mixture by molding the mix, squeezing water out, and draining it. Do this until you cannot get any more water out of the mixture., Most salt blocks for horses come in five pound blocks so try to mold the mixture into blocks that are around four to five pounds.\n\n\nPlace the blocks in old pots or pans so they can harden. Leave the blocks in a cool, shaded area to allow them to dry and harden. This will take about two weeks.\n You can hang the salt block using rope or simply put it on the ground in a spot that is easy to access in your horse\u2019s stall. Check to make sure your horse is ingesting enough of the salt block, especially if you have multiple horses in one area. One horse should consume a five-pound salt block within two months if he is getting enough salt in his diet.Keep in mind hanging the salt block will ensure it stays cleaner for longer, and more appetizing, than if it is lying on the ground in the dirt and the hay.\n It\u2019s important that you give your horse lots of fresh, clean water so his body can process the salt in his diet. Having access to fresh, clean water, as well as a daily salt intake, will ensure your horse flushes out any excess sodium and chloride from his system.\n Over time, your horse\u2019s salt block may get dirty due to exposure to the elements and exposure to dirt and hay in his stall. Keeping the salt block clean will make it more enticing to your horse and encourage him to use the block. Clean the block as needed by hosing it down with water in a metal or plastic tub.\n\n"}

However, if your work is not the type of thing you can do remotely, such as if you work on an assembly line, this may not be an option.\nMake sure this meeting will be kept confidential. You don't want everyone knowing you're going to leave until you do so. Otherwise, there might be some backlash.;\n, If you're unsure how to compose your letter, you may be able to find samples online that will help guide you. Avoid copying a sample verbatim, though. It might not fit your situation.Try to find more than one sample. Read them carefully so you understand the substance well enough to make it your own.\nYou typically don't necessarily want your letter to sound to formal or canned. However, if you're delivering the letter to an abusive or problematic boss, a canned letter may be appropriate.\n As tempting as it may be to fire off an \"I quit\" email, a traditional letter is a better way to go. Even though you're not giving any notice, it shows that you respect your employer.You typically can find a business letter template on any word processing application. Using that will make formatting your letter much easier.\nIf your employer has a dedicated human resources department, create two identical letters. One should be addressed to your boss, the other to the head of human resources.\nInclude your personal address on the letter, along with any additional non-company contact information such as your personal phone number or email address.\n Regardless of your real feelings about your boss or your job experience, courtesy makes a better impression. Being polite and professional will make it easier to accept your resignation.State the exact date on which you want your employment to end. Don't say \"effective immediately\" or \"effective at the end of this week.\"\nIf you're writing the letter on September 14 and you expect your last day to be September 16, write \"I am writing to resign my position, effective September 16.\"\nApologize for not being able to provide any notice, and close your letter by thanking your employer for the opportunity.\n Show your employer you respect their time. Don't go on a long, rambling rant about your personal issues or your problems with the company. Simply state that you're resigning your position, effective immediately, and leave it at that.Keep in mind that this letter could come back to haunt you, even if you already have another job lined up. You shouldn't put it past your boss to send a copy of the letter to your new employer \u2013 especially if you live and work in a relatively small town, or work in a close-knit industry.\nIf you're not comfortable disclosing the reason you need to resign, you don't have to say anything specific.\nRemember that as an at-will employee, you can leave at any time for any reason at all, or for no reason.\nMention any issues regarding accrued time off or your last paycheck. Some employers require you to come in for an exit interview when you accept your final paycheck.\nYou should generally be open to follow any existing separation procedures, unless doing so would be impossible \u2013 for example, if you have to travel far away immediately.\n When you've finished your letter, double- and triple-check it for spelling and grammatical errors. You want your last impression to be a good one, and typos or sloppy grammar won't do you any favors.Keep in mind that some people view the presence of typos as a sign of disrespect. You're signaling that you don't think they're worth the effort to produce the best work.\nAfter you've proofread your letter, print it off and sign it by hand. Make copies of your signed letters for your own records before you take them to your employer.\n If at all possible, you want to take the letter to your boss in person rather than mailing it. Mail does have the benefit of being able to later prove the letter was received. However, this benefit is outweighed by the difficulty of timing.When you speak with your boss, be as apologetic as possible. It can help to acknowledge that you understand how your leaving may put them in a bind.\nIf you have a legitimate reason, talk about the situation. They may be able to help you more than they would if you said nothing.\nIf you have any questions about your employer's separation procedures, now is the time to ask them.\nDepending on your position, you may want to offer to help out in the coming weeks or be available by phone or email to answer questions.\nReach out to coworkers or direct supervisors you worked with closely, or with whom you had a strong rapport. You want to thank them personally and let them know you enjoyed working with them, so there are no hard feelings.\n Most established employers, especially larger corporations, will have a written employee handbook. However, you may not have been given your own copy.Even if you do have your own copy, it's likely you haven't looked at it since it was given to you when you first started your job.\nIf you don't have a copy, talk to someone in human resources about getting one. If you want to keep your plans a secret, you don't have to tell them why you need it. Just say you want to check the benefits policy.\nYou also may be able to get a hold of an employee handbook on the sly if you know of a coworker who has a copy. Just ask to see theirs.\n Your employee handbook should have a section dealing with what happens when an employee voluntarily separates from the company. These sections typically state that two weeks' notice is required.If the separation policy makes no mention of providing notice, then you have nothing to worry about. However, this is rarely the case.\nYour employer typically will list consequences for quitting without sufficient notice. A typical consequence is that you cannot expect a positive recommendation from the employer after you're gone.\nOften this means that future employers won't have the ability to verify any positive experience or education you've acquired as a result of the job.\nParticularly if you're just starting in a career, this can be a pretty devastating consequence.\n Whether you get money in your final paycheck for accrued leave may be tied to whether you provided notice. If this is the case, you may want to reconsider whether quitting your job without giving notice is worth it.This may be particularly important if your employer allows you to accrue paid time off and you've been working there for awhile.\nKeep in mind that in that case, this amount may add up to hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.\nHowever, if the reason you must leave without notice involves some emergency, you may be able to make arrangements with your employer to get paid for at least part of this time.\n If you were issued any company property, such as a laptop or a mobile phone, bring them with you on your last day. Find out what the procedures are for checking them back in.Some employers require all company property to be returned at a scheduled exit interview. If your employer has this policy, get a list from human resources of the property that was checked out in your name so you can make sure everything is returned.\nIf you have a parking pass or badge for building security, your employer likely wants those back too.\nCheck your belongings thoroughly before you leave on your final day, and make sure you aren't inadvertently taking home company property such as office supplies or other materials.\n You don't generally need an attorney to quit your job without giving notice \u2013 there's no law against it. However, if you have unresolved issues with your employer, you may need legal advice.If you happened to be under an employment contract, you are not an at-will employee. It is imperative that you find an experienced employment attorney who can analyze our contract and the penalties for breaking it. Do this before you quit.\nIn some circumstances you may feel as though you were forced to quit. If your workplace was abusive or unsafe, an employment attorney can help you assess your legal options.\nYou also may need legal assistance if something happens after you quit. For example, your employer might seek reimbursement for expenses that were covered while you were an employee.\nThis is most likely to happen if your employer paid for continuing education courses or something similar that has a future benefit.\n If you're quitting your job without giving notice because you need to immediately start another job, your decision likely will have few if any negative consequences. However, it's generally good form to make sure your new employer is aware that you are quitting without notice.It's also important to keep in mind that if you quit without notice and without good cause, you probably will not be eligible for unemployment benefits.\nIf you have to quit your job without giving notice because of a family or personal emergency, this may not be possible.\nHowever, to the extent possible, your best option is to seek other employment while you're still working. Once hired, let them know you're available to start immediately.\nSome new jobs may not give you the time to work out a notice. If you fear the job offer will be rescinded if you have to work out a notice, you may have no choice.\nIn any event, making sure your new employer knows that you are quitting your old job without giving notice can spare an unfortunate surprise. If your former employer decides to share this information with your new employer, you won't have to worry about negative consequences.\n Getting a written reference letter from your immediate supervisor before your last day can cut through a lot of red tape. This letter can be especially valuable depending on your employer's notice policy.You also should keep in mind that someone's opinion might change. When you leave, you may create a vacuum that leaves your immediate supervisor and coworkers scrambling.\nIn light of increased stress and an expanded workload, they may not be as generous in describing your time working with them.\nKeep in mind that providing a written reference is no guarantee that a new employer won't call your old job. However, it can lessen their motivation to do so.\n If you're filling out a standard application for a job, it likely will require information about how you left your job. Often you must specify whether you provided notice.As tempting as it may be, don't check the box indicating that you gave notice if you didn't.\nA potential employer can easily find out this information by calling your own employer, and may do so even if you state that you prefer they aren't contacted.\nDespite answering \"no\" when asked if a former employer can be contacted, a prospective employer still may call to verify that the information you provided was correct.\nAside from that, telling a prospective employer that they can't contact a former employer is typically a bad idea. It sends up red flags by signaling to the prospective employer that you left on bad terms.\n When you leave a job without notice, it may come up in future interviews. Employers often look at employees who quit without notice as people who didn't respect their employer.Particularly if you have another job lined up when you quit, leaving this employer without giving notice may not make any difference.\nHowever, be aware that there are some managers who are sticklers about this sort of thing. They may have seemingly arbitrary rules such as never hiring someone who has quit a job without notice. This isn't something you can predict or control.\nIf you have a legitimate explanation for why you quit without giving notice, share it with prospective employers.\nIf your former employer understood and didn't fault you for leaving, sharing their response to your resignation will look even better.\n\n"}

Doing this increases the distance between the two of you. Remember that trying to be right can make the relationship lose. Think like a team\u2014each player must contribute to the win. If one player loses, everyone loses.\n\n\nCompromise provides a chance for the relationship (i.e. both of you) to win rather than just one of you. If you keep this in mind during an argument, you are more likely to reach a solution that benefits the well-being of your relationship.\nThe next time you and your partner are vying to be right, take a breather and consider what being right is doing for the relationship as a whole. Don't allow your pride to weaken your bond with your spouse. Try to reach the resolution that fosters growth and success for the relationship.;\n, To reach a mutually beneficial solution, it may be a good idea to take a step back and view the situation more objectively.\n\n\nEach of you can create a two-column list of pros and cons about the issue, including how the issue aligns with each of your personal beliefs and values. Once you have completed the lists, discuss them aloud to see if the benefits of the decision outweigh the downsides.Consider that issues that go against one of your personal beliefs may require more compromise from one partner than the other. Try to reach a conclusion that does not require either of you to sacrifice your values.\n If you are debating a complex issue, you may want to ponder potential avenues over a span of days or weeks rather than jumping to a conclusion. You can hold a brainstorm session listing out all the possible ways you can handle a given problem. You can then go over the list with family members or friends and consider their opinions. Sleeping on the issue and letting it sit for a while may help you to reach a natural conclusion once the emotions die down.For example, imagine your spouse received a promotion that would require a cross-country move. The two of you might weigh the pros and cons--like more money for the household versus one spouse having to leave his or her current job. Then, you might choose to discuss the matter with your parents or your children. If everyone together can see that the move might be beneficial (even if the initial change is hard), then you might agree to go forward with it.\n If you have become the doormat in your marriage, it is time to start saying how you feel, offering your opinions and giving your take on how you would like to do certain things. Improve your assertiveness by:Taking baby steps. The next time your partner asks your opinion about something seemingly small, such as an outfit or what movie to watch, provide an answer. Do this bit by bit, until you start to feel more comfortable using your voice.\nSay \u201cno\u201d if you must. While you want to please your partner, you must expect that you won\u2019t always be able to meet his or her every need or demand. Exercise your right to say \u201cno\u201d. For example, if you are really busy and your spouse asks for a favor, you might say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t right now, honey. Can we work out something else?\u201d\n\n, Marriage is about give and take. Yes, at some point or another both of you will make sacrifices. But, it\u2019s another matter when you\u2019re always the one taking and never giving. If compromising for the sake of the relationship requires that your partner turn his or her back on core values and beliefs, you may be the one that needs to up your compromising skills.A one-sided relationship that does not allow you or your partner to be who you are or live out your truths is extremely unhealthy. See a counselor if you have trouble compromising to the point that your partner is always bending to meet your needs.\n\n"}

Different styles of mazes will challenge your mouse in different ways and teach you different things about its behavior.You may want to see how fast your mouse can complete the maze and whether or not its performance improves over time. In this case, you would want to build a maze with only one end-point.\nYou may want to gain insight into your mouse's habits or preferences. In this case, you would want to build a maze with two or more end-points so that your mouse can choose which one it prefers.;\n, Once you've decided what you want to learn about your mouse from the maze, you can choose the style of maze that best meets your needs. There are five basic designs to choose from for your maze, and you can customize them from there.If you want to build a maze with one end-point, you have two basic designs to choose from. You can build a classic maze, which is rectangular and has a series of paths, some of which turn into dead-ends. With this design, it is possible for the mouse to have more than two choices at each intersection. Alternatively, you could build a large maze that consists of several interconnected T shapes. With this design, the mouse must choose to turn either right or left at every point where one T connects to another. One choice always leads to the next T and the other always leads to a dead-end, which makes it very simple to calculate how many mistakes the mouse makes along the way.\nIf you want to build a maze with multiple end-points, you can build a T-shaped maze, a Y-shaped maze, or a maze with several radial arms (which will end up looking like the spokes on a wheel).\n Some mazes are simple and consist of just a few twists and turns, while others are much more complicated. Consider whether you want to start out small and give your mouse an easy maze, or if you want to challenge it with a much more complicated design.If you are building a maze with a single end-point, you can make it more challenging by adding lots of different branches and dead-ends along the way. Your maze can have has many twists and turns as you like, as long as there is a way to get out.\nIf you are building a maze with multiple end-points, you can make it more challenging by making the corners sharper. T-shaped mazes are generally tougher for mice to navigate than Y-shaped mazes. You could also consider adding more than two arms to your maze.\n Once you've settled on a basic design for your maze, start drawing so you know exactly how you want to lay it out. Your initial drawing does not need to be to scale; it just needs to be an accurate representation of where the different paths will lead.\n\n\nOnce you're done with your drawing, double-check that the maze really does have a solution. You wouldn't want to put your mouse in an impossible-to-solve maze.\n Start with a flat piece of cardboard that is the same size as the maze you want to build. This will be the floor of your maze.If you are starting with a cardboard box, you may be able to leave the sides in place so that you won't have to attach exterior walls later on.\n Now that you know exactly how big your maze will be, it's time to draw out your design on the piece of cardboard that will be the floor of the maze. Drawing your design out will make it much easier to assemble the maze.Consider using a pencil so you can erase your lines if you make a mistake.\nMake sure the paths are all wide enough for your mouse to fit through.\n Use a separate piece of cardboard to construct the walls of your maze. You will need to measure the length of each wall, use your scissors or knife to cut a piece of cardboard to the appropriate length, and secure it in place with hot glue. Do this for the interior walls (which you marked with pencil) and the exterior walls, along the entire perimeter of your maze.It may be easier to start from the center and work your way out so that you don't need to lean over the exterior walls in order to attach the interior ones.\nMake sure all of your walls, both interior and exterior, are the same height.\nYou can use other types of glue as well, but hot glue is a good choice because it dries very quickly. Be sure to hold the wall in place until the glue begins to harden.\nRun a bead of glue along the corners where two walls meet as well. This will provide extra stability.\n In order to motivate your mouse to find the end of the maze and reward it for solving the puzzle, place some kind of a reward at the end. Rewards are usually food, like unsweetened cereal or peanut butter.If you're using a maze with multiple end-points, you may want to add two different rewards. For example, you could place cereal at one end and peanut butter at the other end to find out which one your mouse prefers.\nIn some cases, you may not want to add a reward. If, for example, you want to test whether your mouse has an innate preference for turning right or left, you would probably want to let it run the maze a few times with no reward.\n It's a good idea to add some kind of transparent lid to your maze to prevent the mouse from climbing over the walls. You can use a piece of hardware cloth or a thin sheet of plexiglass with some holes for ventilation.Whatever you use, make sure it is transparent enough that you can still see the mouse through it, and that it is ventilated so your mouse has plenty of air.\nThe top doesn't need to be secured in any way. Just rest it on top of the maze so it's easy to remove it when it's time to put your mouse inside. If you find that your mouse pushes up on the top to try to escape, you can put some pressure on it with your hand or place something else on top of it (like a book, for example).\nIf you add a top, be sure the walls are high enough so that your mouse can easily navigate the paths without being squished. If you choose not to put a top on your maze, you should build your walls extra high to discourage the mouse from trying to climb out.\n If you want your maze to be extra sturdy, you can use wood for your floor and walls instead of cardboard. You will build your maze the same way, but you will need to use a saw to cut your wood to the appropriate size and construction adhesive to hold the walls in place.A wooden maze will last much longer than a cardboard maze because mice can easily chew through cardboard.\nIf you are using a material that's heavier than cardboard, it's very important to make sure that the walls are sturdy so that they won't fall down and injure your mouse. You may want to use some screws or nails in addition to your adhesive.\n Another fun and easy way to build a maze is to use interlocking building blocks. Simply stack them on top of each other to create whatever pattern you want.This works especially well if you have a base plate for your building blocks that is the same size as the maze you want to build. This will help ensure that your walls don't fall over.\nIf you choose this method, you probably won't want to draw your design on the base. That's fine because there's no glue involved, so you can easily change the location of your blocks if you make a mistake.\n If you want to be able to change the layout of your maze frequently without using blocks, consider attaching Velcro strips to the bottoms of your interior walls and to the floor instead of gluing the walls in place. If you choose this modification, you will still use cardboard as your main building material.\n\n\nYou will probably have to add more Velcro to the floor if you want to change the location of the walls.\nConsider adding Velcro to the sides of your walls as well so that they stick to each other. This will provide extra stability in case your mouse leans against the wall.\n No matter what you built your maze out of, you can decorate it to make it a little more personal. Use your imagination to make your maze just the way you want it.\n\n\nIf you used cardboard, you could glue colorful construction paper to the outsides of the maze and decorate it with stickers and markers.If you used wood, you could paint the maze or draw directly on the wood with markers.\nIf you used blocks, you probably won't want to apply glue or paint to them, but you could still use construction paper to decorate the outsides by simply taping it in place.\n\n"}

If you see something that doesn\u2019t belong, take it with you.\nIf your house has two floors, make a rule that you never go upstairs empty-handed; always bring something with you that needs to be put away upstairs.\nInstitute the one-minute rule: if something takes under a minute to do, do it right now.\n Cut two lemons in half and place them in a glass dish with some water. Microwave the water until it starts to boil, then allow the bowl to cool in the microwave for a moment. The steam from the bowl should allow you to easily wipe away the mess in your microwave.Allow the water to boil while you wipe down your counters and appliances for a five minute kitchen clean.\nKeep an eye on the water in the bowl to make sure it doesn\u2019t boil over. Otherwise, it will take you twice as long to clean up.\n The key to getting everything done within your thirty minute timeframe is to stay focused. For the thirty minutes your timer is on, you only do the chores and tasks you have assigned. Do not allow yourself to get distracted by e-mails, texts or anything else. Work as hard as you can for the thirty minutes allotted, and when your time is up, move on to something else.Reward yourself with a treat or fun activity for completing your work.\nInvite friends over to help (but keep in mind, you may end up having to help with their chores as well.)\n\n"}

Let them know that you\u2019re interested in throwing a kitten shower to benefit their organization.While shelters and humane societies often plan their own kitten showers, they make great projects for Girl and Boy Scout troops, church or civic organizations, or a group of animal loving friends.\nA shower is typically held at the shelter or humane society it benefits.;\n, In the Northern Hemisphere, many shelters are in greatest need during the month of April. While a shelter or humane society would doubtlessly benefit from a charitable event any time of the year, a springtime shower will have the greatest impact., A kitten shower involves lots of groundwork and careful planning. Recruiting around twenty volunteers will make sure the work is accomplished without one or a few people getting overwhelmed.The shelter or humane society likely has a pool of regular volunteers. Recruit helpers from this pool and send out a request to the shelter's email list. Their staff can also help plan and run the event.\nFind additional volunteers by asking other members of your troop or organization, coworkers, or neighbors. If you have kids, ask around their daycare or school.\n Once you\u2019ve assembled your team, make sure everyone has a clear task or tasks. Examples of duties that you should delegate include:Set up and clean up crews\nInvitation and press release design\nMarketing coordinator\nFoster and adoption coordinators (likely members of the shelter\u2019s staff)\nFood prep and serving\nDonation collectors\nRaffle and game coordinators\n\n, Ask local restaurants to donate food as soon as possible, preferably months in advance. Many have a limited budget for charitable donations, so you\u2019ll want to make sure they can provide you with some light bites.Ask multiple restaurants to donate one appetizer instead of relying on one to cater the entire event. Ask in person or send a friendly email.\nIf the shelter or humane society can provide a charitable donation receipt so the restaurant can use the donation as a tax write-off, use that as an incentive.\nYou should also see if a restaurant or other local business can provide a gift certificate or other prizes that you can use for raffles and games., Buy balloons, streamers, tablecloths, cups, plates, napkins, and other items from a dollar store to keep your budget low. You should be able to decorate and supply the event for less than $100 (US).You can also see if restaurants donating food can also supply serving-ware and napkins.\n You don\u2019t have to limit donation drop-offs to the shower date and location. Ask local pet supply stores, groomers, and other pet-related businesses if they can set up a donation station on premises.Ask if they\u2019re willing to accept donations throughout the entire month instead of just on the day of the shower.\n Not everyone will want to donate supplies, so you should make sure you\u2019re able to field cash donations. Make sure your system is simple and secure. To enable guests to donate money via credit or debit, use a mobile credit card reader linked to an account in the shelter\u2019s name.For example, some shelters in Florida, USA, use WeGive.org to collect donations in multiple payment methods. The site also allows shelters to list information about what various dollar amounts will buy, like toys, food, and veterinary care."}

Set the beans aside for a few minutes.Make sure your hands have been washed before removing the skins.\n Put olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and chili flakes into a bowl. Whisk the ingredients together. Add a pinch of salt and pepper for flavor., The way you cook the rice depends on the type of wild rice you bought. Cook the wild rice according to the instructions on the packaging. Typically, you will need to pour the wild rice into a pot of boiling water. Cook the rice on the lowest setting for about 10 to 15 minutes.The cook time could be as little as 3-5 minutes, depending on the brand of wild rice.\n Put all of these ingredients into a bowl. Then, pour in the dressing. Toss gently until the ingredients and dressing have been thoroughly mixed together., Whether you bought or grew the cress, you will need to wash it first. Put it under running water to wash off any dirt or debris that may be on the cress. Put the cress between paper towels for a few minutes to dry it off. Then, use a chef\u2019s knife to cut it into small enough pieces to fit on top of the eggs., Put the two to three handfuls of cress into the bowl with the other ingredients. Toss the salad gently.

{"title": "How to Retain Knowledge2", "summary": "link your knowledge to larger concepts.\nconnect facts to ideas.\nevaluate your own learning process.\nopt for the final project.\ndon\u2019t focus on just one thing for too long.", "article": " It\u2019s much easier to remember facts if you understand why those facts are true. Ask yourself, or your teacher: why do things work the way they do? If you understand the larger conceptual framework, you will be able to retrieve knowledge more easily and even guess more accurately.\n\n]For example, if you have to memorize geographical borders, think about how those borders were formed. Notice that in many places, borders follow natural features such as rivers and mountain ranges. By observing a general rule like this you save yourself from having to memorize each individual border; instead, you can remember which borders follow this rule.\n You are more likely to remember something if you can associate it with other, related things. Tell a story to yourself about a particular fact: even if your story is light-hearted, it will cement the fact in your mind.\n\n\nThis is sometimes call the Baker/baker paradox. Shown a picture of a woman, people are much more likely to remember that she is a baker than that her name is Baker. This is because the idea of being a baker has more associations. It conjures up thoughts of bread and might suggest links with the image: perhaps her face looks doughy, for example., Assess yourself by asking whether you are absorbing new material and whether you understand the big concepts that underlie that material. Reflect on what aspects of the learning process have worked for you and what aspects were less helpful. This kind of self-evaluation is known as metacognition, and it has been shown to improve your ability to transfer what you\u2019ve learned to new settings and situations., Sometimes you are allowed to choose between taking a final exam or completing a final project. In other cases, you might have the choice to take a class that assigns a project. Where possible, choose the final project. Completing a complex project related to the knowledge area is associated with greater retention of knowledge than taking a test alone., Instead, turn from one task to another, and intersperse studying one subject with studying something else.Look for connections between the different topics. Seeing how knowledge fits together into a larger picture will help you to understand its significance and remember it better.\n\n"}

If you grew up in a home with homophobic parents, know that their reaction might not be ideal. Make a plan for the worst case scenario so that you can be better prepared.For instance, if you are worried about potential violence, you might opt to tell them on the phone. If they begin to yell or curse at you, you could say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I cannot be yelled at Mom. I would love to talk about this more when emotions aren\u2019t so high.

A play date at the park also is a great idea if your child has a friend without significant vision impairment.You might pull up plants and examine the roots with your child, or catch bugs. They also may have fun exploring playgrounds, swinging on swings or running their hands over the equipment to see how it's put together.\nIf you live in the United States, you might try NPR's directory of accessible playgrounds nationwide. Just visit www.playgroundsforeveryone.com and type in an address to begin., Because petting zoos focus on the senses of touch, smell, and hearing, they can be great places for a blind or visually impaired child to explore the world and connect with different kinds of animals.The animals at petting zoos typically are very calm and tame, and will allow your child to explore them.\nTalk to your child about the animal they are touching, the part of that animal the child is touching, and what that animal does. When the child touches a different animal, talk about the differences between the two.\n Many libraries and museums have play-date type activities specifically designed for blind and visually impaired kids. These events can help your child explore their community as well as giving them the opportunity to meet other blind or visually impaired kids their age.Your local library or community center may have a bulletin board where information about activities and events are posted. You also may be able to find this information on the library's website.\nIf your city government has a community events page on its website, you also may be able to find information there.\nAsk at local museums, especially children's museums, to find out if they have special events or specific days for blind or visually impaired kids.\n If your child enjoys the water, backyard water slides, wading pools, or fountains can provide a fun activity for a play date, especially on hot days. You don't have to get fancy \u2013 often a simple garden hose is enough.Keep in mind that if there are too many elements, they can get overwhelming. Try to limit your water play activities to one or two things.\nIf your child doesn't like cold water, you might try running the hose from the kitchen sink so you can use warm water.\nIf you make a slide in the backyard, you can use other liquids on the surface, such as whipped cream, so the kids can enjoy different sensations. Just make sure the liquid you use isn't too slick.\n If you live in or near a more rural area, you may be able to find a working berry farm where you can take your blind or visually impaired child along with a friend. Picking berries engages your child's senses of touch, hearing, and taste.This also can be an educational experience, because the child will learn where berries come from and how they are harvested.\nCall ahead to the farm before you go and let them know you will have a child who is blind or visually impaired. They may be able to offer specific accommodations, or may have special events for blind and visually impaired kids.\n Fishing is another activity that is both fun and educational. While you'll typically have to help with things like baiting the hook and removing the fish from the line, blind or visually impaired kids can still actively fish themselves.Catching a fish can give your child a sense of accomplishment. The process also teaches your child where fish come from and how they are caught for eating.\nHolding and touching a fish presents a unique sensory experience for the child, who will be able to feel the muscles in the fish and the flapping gills.\nIf you go somewhere that doesn't require catch-and-release, you also have the opportunity to take the caught fish home and cook them. This will give the child a better sense of how food gets to their plate.\n\n"}

The ground-state energy E1{\\displaystyle E_{1}} is called the zero-point energy of the particle.

Since n{\\displaystyle n} can only be an integer, it is convenient to set n=1{\\displaystyle n=1} here, as the only purpose of substituting a value is to obtain an expression for A.{\\displaystyle A.} It is helpful to know the integral \u222b0\u03c0sin2\u2061xdx=\u03c02{\\displaystyle \\int _{0}^{\\pi }\\sin ^{2}x{\\mathrm {d} }x={\\frac {\\pi }{2}}} when normalizing.\n\n\n1=\u222b\u03c8\u2217(x)\u03c8(x)dx=\u222b0LA\u2217Asin2\u2061n\u03c0xL,\u00a0n\u2208Z{\\displaystyle 1=\\int \\psi ^{*}(x)\\psi (x){\\mathrm {d} }x=\\int _{0}^{L}A^{*}A\\sin ^{2}{\\frac {n\\pi x}{L}},\\ n\\in {\\mathbb {Z} }}\n\n\n1|A|2=\u222b0Lsin2\u2061\u03c0xLdx,\u00a0u=\u03c0xL=\u222b0\u03c0L\u03c0sin2\u2061udu=L\u03c0\u03c02{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\frac {1}{|A|^{2}}}&=\\int _{0}^{L}\\sin ^{2}{\\frac {\\pi x}{L}}{\\mathrm {d} }x,\\ u={\\frac {\\pi x}{L}}\\\\&=\\int _{0}^{\\pi }{\\frac {L}{\\pi }}\\sin ^{2}u{\\mathrm {d} }u\\\\&={\\frac {L}{\\pi }}{\\frac {\\pi }{2}}\\end{aligned}}}\n\n\nA=2L{\\displaystyle A={\\sqrt {\\frac {2}{L}}}}\n\n\n, This is the description of a particle inside a box, surrounded by infinite potential energy walls. While n{\\displaystyle n} can take on a negative value, the result would simply negate the wavefunction and result in a phase change, not an entirely different state.

Don't invite more people than you need to - a confession should be a humbling affair, not a chance for you to perform for an audience. Organize a small, in-person get-together with the person(s) you've done wrong to. You can be as direct as you like in your invitation. There's nothing wrong with simply saying, \"I have a confession to make. When can we meet?\" Try not to make a joke about this, laughing maybe taken as an offense and will ruin the confession\n\n\nGive yourself some privacy. Confessions can, unfortunately, cause emotions to flare. Don't open yourself or your confessor up to embarrassment by, for example, confessing in a crowded restaurant.;\n, For much of our lives, we project certain facades and cultivate certain self-images that reflect how we want to be seen by other people. A confession is no time to worry about these things. Realize that a sincere confession reveals the inner \"you.\" You can't make a good confession from a false position of superiority. You're acknowledging your own imperfection, which, for many people, is an especially difficult, intimate task. Any attempts to remain \"cool\" or aloof will make you seem insincere. Be ready to shed any pretenses that you normally maintain.\n\n\nHere's an example of a confession that sounds disingenuous: \"Hey, Frank, I broke your trumpet. Sorry! Guess I don't know my own strength!\" This confession doesn't seem to come from a place of sincere regret - by trying to keep the mood light, the speaker sacrifices the integrity of his confession. A better approach would be something like: \"Hey, Frank. Listen, I have some bad news. I accidentally broke your trumpet. I'm so sorry. I know how important it was to you. \"\nWe don't only maintain facades when we deal with other people. We also routinely lie to ourselves about our true motivations. Be completely open and honest with your internal thoughts - why did you do the bad things you did? Don't make any excuses for yourself if you don't have any.\n This is the central purpose of your confession - to reveal that you've done wrong. Be direct and to the point. Tell the people you have gathered with that you've made a mistake that's hurt them. Tell them that you feel bad about what you've done and that you want forgiveness. Calmly and clearly explain what you did, how you've hurt them, and why you're sorry.\n\n\nDon't beat around the bush. If you're confessing for saying nasty about a friend behind his or her back, don't try to ease into the subject by, for instance, talking about how catty the characters in the movie Mean Girls are. It's much better to just say, \"I was mad that you didn't invite me to go camping, so I told Jen that you hate her. I'm really, really sorry. It was seriously petty of me to ruin your friendship.\"\nBe prepared to weather the anger or grief of the people you've wronged. If you've seriously hurt someone, don't be surprised if they react to your confession by getting angry, crying, or shouting. The emotions surrounding a confession can be very painful. Know that, no matter how bad things get during a confession, by coming clean you're making things better in the long run than if you had allowed this person to continue without knowing the truth about things.\n \"Confession\" implies that the knowledge of your wrongdoing is a secret. So, when you make a confession, you may also need to explain the true course of events surrounding your wrongdoing, especially if you've previously lied about what's happened. This is extremely important if someone else has taken the blame for your mistake or misdeed. You owe it to everyone involved to make sure they know the truth, even if the truth is painful.\n\n\nFor instance, if you sat in silence as a classmate took the blame for the senior prank that you planned, when you confess to the principal, to exonerate the innocent party (your classmate) and to ensure that the guilty party (you) receive justice, you'll need to correct the \"official\" version of events.\n By confessing to someone, we lower ourselves before them. A confession is no time to be stubborn or prideful. Don't try to paint your actions as somehow noble or well-intended if they weren't. Don't excuse yourself if you don't deserve it. Don't use a confession as an opportunity to subtly build yourself up or put the person you've wronged down. Acknowledge your wrongdoing with humble dignity.\n\n\nNever blame your victim while you're confessing. If you've \"borrowed\" a little money out of someone's purse, don't say something like \"I'm sorry I took your money, but I only did it because you wouldn't buy me those shoes I liked.\"\n\n, Be humble and direct. A line like \"I'm really, really sorry. I hope you can forgive me\" works fine. This should be what you want out of a confession - to get the assurance that you're forgiven in the heart of the person(s) you've hurt. This gives you a sense of closure and internal peace. It also allows you to begin to move on because when you're forgiven you know that you're \"done\" with the confession process. After you're forgiven, any additional guilt will have no purpose, so try to move on.\n\n\nUnfortunately, in some cases, the people you've wronged might not forgive you. If you've hurt someone multiple times or you've done something especially egregious, they're justified in withholding their forgiveness. In this case, it's not enough to say you're sorry - show them that you're truly repentant by changing your behavior.\n You've confessed and (hopefully) been forgiven. How do you move forward? A good first step is to ask for advice on to what to do next. For instance, the person you hurt might give you instructions on how to make things up to them. They might also tell you who else you need to confess to. They might even tell you how your personal relationship has changed. If you've done something serious, your relationship with the people you've hurt may be subject to new rules or boundaries. For instance, if you've used your access to someone's sensitive information to spread gossip, you may no longer be trusted with secrets. Honor these new boundaries to show you're truly sorry and to speed your journey back to normal levels of trust.\n\n\nRemember that confession doesn't \"wipe the slate clean.\" Don't return to your old bad behavior. A confession should be used not just for forgiveness, but also for growth, so be sure to move forward, away from your bad deeds, not backward.\n If you've done something wrong with serious consequences, like if you've committed a crime, you should make your initial confession to a law enforcement representative or another appropriate authority. Cooperating fully with the authorities also serves a practical purpose - it can be used to reduce the length or severity of your punishment.\n\n\nNever try to lie to a judge or police officer to avoid a confession. This is a crime. By making these lies, you make your eventual punishment even worse.\n It can be very, very hard to confess to someone you're romantically involved with. No one wants to hurt or disappoint the people they love. Unfortunately, by not confessing, you are hurting your S.O. They just don't know they're being hurt. Confessions within the context of a romantic relationship can be very difficult and painful, so, if you're hesitating, motivate yourself to start the confession process by thinking of your confession as an act of love. You're showing that you love your partner by telling them the truth, even if the truth damages their opinion of you.\n\n\nThis being said, don't twist your love for your partner into an excuse for your actions. \"I kept this information from you because I love you\" isn't a justification for your behavior. If you haven't been honest to your partner, you've hurt them. Period.\n In a relationship, it's even more important than normal that your partner knows exactly how you've hurt them. Because you (presumably) still care about your partner, it can be tempting to avoid hurting his or her feelings by lying about what you've done to make your wrongdoing seem less serious than it is or somehow well-intentioned. Don't do this. Your partner deserves to know the truth, even if it's a painful truth. This will also open your relationship up to future heartbreak, should your lie be discovered. Be honest and tell the whole story of your wrongdoing.\n\n\nWhile it's very important to be forthcoming about what you've done, it's possible to cause unnecessary pain by giving too much detail in your confession. If, for instance, you've committed an act of infidelity, you should be honest about who was involved and when the event occurred, but you shouldn't go into a detailed play-by-play of the day's events unless you're asked to - this information can be very painful for your partner to hear.\nThink of a romantic confession as a particularly difficult way of updating your partner on the state of your relationship. You can't have a healthy relationship that's open to growth if both partners have different ideas about what's happening in the relationship.\n There's a reason that we say that \"trust is the foundation of a relationship.\" A relationship without some degree of trust isn't possible. We can't spy on our partners 24/7, so we trust them to be honest about what they've done and what they've said. We also trust our partners to be open about the way that they feel. If you've been concealing your actions or feelings from your partner, you've damaged their ability to trust you. A sincere apology may, in time, help you regain that trust.\n In addition to apologizing for violating your partner's trust, you should also devote a little time to apologizing for the fact that you've reduced the happiness, openness, and overall health of the relationship you share. You have, in a sense, damaged something that you both own. Making a confession to your partner is like coming clean about ruining a project you both worked on together, but with very high emotional stakes.\n\n\nThe time after a confession can be tense and awkward for both partners. It can even, depending on the severity of your wrongdoing, be marked by real sadness. When you apologize for damaging your relationship, it can be wise to apologize for the hard times your confession will cause in the near future.\n Confessing to wrongdoing is always a healthier, more honest thing to do that keeping your actions a secret. However, a confession can change a relationship. It may change the way your partner and you think about each other. It may change the the amount that you trust each other. In serious cases, your relationship may even be damaged beyond repair. Accept these changes to your relationship. Confessions open up the path of healing and allow you to start working past your mistakes, but they don't absolve you of the consequences of your actions.\n\n\nLet's hypothetically say that you make a sincere confession to your partner about an act of infidelity you've committed. Suppose your partner says that s/he would like to \"take a break\" from your relationship. Even if this is very difficult for you, you need to humbly honor your partner's wish. After all, the relationship is as much your partner's as it is yours. If one partner wants to end a relationship or make a serious change to it, the other partner has no right to force him or her not to.\n\n"}

Place it around your head -- going over the hair at the back of your head rather than underneath it. At the front, the band should be about halfway down your forehead.\n Starting at the very front, take a small strand of hair and tuck it underneath the headband, twisting slightly as you go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrab a second strand of hair, join it with the first, then tuck it underneath the headband in the same manner. Keep working your way around your head wrapping uniform sections of hair around the headband.\nThe tighter you wrap the hair, the tighter the curls will be, and vice versa.\n Once you have wrapped all the hair around the headband on both sides, you will be left with a single strand of hair at the very back. Twist this until it curls upwards towards the scalp, then secure with a bobby pin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a little more volume at the front, push the headband upwards towards your hairline. This will create volume and prevent you from getting a red line across your forehead!\n\n, Now all you need to do is go to sleep with your hair secured in the headband. If you're concerned about frizz, try sleeping with a plastic shower cap over your head.\n In the morning, remove the bobby pin securing the hair at the back, then gently pull the headband out of your hair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse your fingers to gently separate the hair and work and work it into the desired shape.

The equation is as follows: CAGR=((EV/SV)^ 1/T)) -1., After your values have been inputted in the CAGR equation, simply solve for CAGR using the proper order of operations. That is, be sure to calculate the (1/T) first, because it is an exponent, then solve for EV/SV and raise that number to the power found in the first step. Finally, subtract 1 from the number you just found. The result will be your CAGR.\n\n\nFor example, if a portfolio of investments had an initial value of $10,000 that grew to $19,500 over 3 years, you would start with CAGR=(($19,500/$10,000)^(1/3))-1 and simplify to CAGR=((1.95)^(0.333))-1 and CAGR=1.249-1.

It can be a bit tricky to brush your teeth with braces, but with some practice you will soon get used to it. You should brush for at least two minutes, two or three times a day. With braces it\u2019s advisable to brush after every meal if possible.\n\n\nBrush with a fluoride toothpaste or with an anti-sensitivity toothpaste that also protects your enamel.\nBraces can increase the chances of getting bits of food stuck in your teeth and around your braces.\nA quick brush after eating can deal with this.\nTry to carry a travel toothbrush with you, but if you get caught out, you can rinse your mouth out with water to dislodge bits of food.\nSwoosh the water well in your mouth and then spit it out.;\n, When you brush you should use a soft bristle toothbrush, which has a head small enough to enable you to get to all of your teeth. You should be able to use an electric toothbrush, but you will have to take extra care when you do this. Speak to your orthodontist if you\u2019re struggling to clean your teeth with your brace. The orthodontist will be able to recommend special smaller headed toothbrushes that make it easier.Place the brush at a 45 degree angle, where your gums meets your teeth.\nUse a vertical, circular scrub motion and remember to clean all the surfaces of your teeth., Your orthodontist may recommend you supplement your regular toothbrush with a special interdental brush. These are essentially mini-toothbrushes, which are designed specifically to get into hard to reach places in your mouth. They are excellent for people with braces, as they can get under the wire and between the wire and the tooth.\n\n\nYou can also use oral irrigators (sometimes called water picks) to help you clean around your braces. Oral irrigators are great for people with braces because they also massage your gums, which can help to prevent gingivitis.\nThese devices spray out a pressurized stream of water mixed with mouthwash that can dislodge food from around brace wires and bands.\nRemember that these devices should be used in addition to, not instead of, brushing and flossing., It is still important to floss every day if you have braces. Floss before you brush your teeth at least once a day. You might find it easier to do this in the evening before you go to bed as you will probably have more time than in the morning. Flossing can be tricky with a brace, but you can do it if you thread the floss carefully.\n\n\nIf you are struggling to floss around your braces you may find that using a \u201cfloss threader\u201d helps.\nThese devices act like the eye of a needle, which you can thread the floss through before pushing it under the wire., You should use an alcohol-free fluoride mouthwash once a day to help you keep your teeth and your braces clean and in a good condition. You will be able to find a suitable mouthwash in your local drug store or pharmacy.\n\n\nUse the mouthwash at a different time of day to when you brush your teeth to help maintain the fluoride protection of your teeth for longer.\nTry to avoid eating or rinsing your mouth for twenty minutes after using the mouthwash."}

To avoid losing those precious moments when the ice cream still looks fantastic, it is important to prepare all of your equipment and props in advance for still food photography.\n\n\nHave all of your camera equipment in place, including tripod (if using), special lenses, filters, etc. A tripod can be an excellent piece of equipment for indoor ice cream photography; you can set the camera in place at the angle that pleases the eye best, relying on props (such as yogurt containers, etc.) to serve as mock ice cream until you've adjusted the camera to the exact settings desired.Once done, grab your ice cream, remove the props and arrange the ice cream in the predetermined positions, and shoot away for the next few minutes.\nCheck that the lighting is just as you want it (see below for tips).\nFor ice cream that will be sitting in a bowl or other prop, place the prop into the freezer for at least 20 minutes prior to taking the shot. That way, you will have a very cold prop for the ice cream to sit on, providing you with extra time to make adjustments before the ice cream melts.This is especially important for warm locations or if you're taking the ice cream outside in the sun.\nFor photography on the go, simply have your camera ready for those candid moments of people with their ice creams.;\n, Early morning and the evenings are suitable times, out of the sun's glare.For indoor photography, choose cool, air-conditioned rooms. Naturally, the fact that you might want different, brighter light on your ice cream subject will impact your decision on the time of day to shoot.\n Are you setting up the photo of a specific ice cream after making or purchasing it, or are you simply hoping to come across ice creams being held by people outdoors as you walk about? Obviously, if you're setting up the ice cream shoot from scratch, there is a bit more effort involved.\n\n\nDo you want the ice cream in a bowl, in a cone, on a plate? Perhaps its original packaging is interesting enough to use as well.\nDo you want someone holding the ice cream, a pet licking it, or some other action shot? Will you need to set the shots up, or are you looking for candid shots on a beach, at a park, or at a special event?\nDo you want the ice cream to be the main feature or to form part of a set-up with other food? If so, the other food will need to be prepared and arranged in place before adding the ice cream at the last moment (see arranging props above).\nDo you want to photograph the ice cream in a kitchen, a dining room, or perhaps al fresco in your garden? Each option has its own challenges of light, background, temperature, and accessibility that need to be worked out in advance.\nIf photographing people with their ice cream, consider whether you want to take photographs of children (always delightful but can be hard work to have them stand still) or adults, individuals or groups, and so on. Is the situation appropriate to take photos on the fly or will you need to ask for permission?\n\nAt a bare minimum, it is polite to ask \"Do you mind if I take a photo of you/your kids eating that ice cream?\" If the potential subjects ask why, you can explain in greater detail.\n If you're setting up the shoot, what kind of ice cream are you photographing?\n\n\nIs the ice cream scooped, sandwiched, curled, whipped, soft serve, or coated?\nIs it a sorbet, an ice lolly, a popsicle, a cone, or a sundae?\nIs it coated in exciting and tasty sprinkles, chocolate, or other ice cream toppers?\n\n, The background may be determined by the reason for the photo shoot. If you're being paid to do a food shoot, you might be obliged to use their choice of dinnerware and such, but if you have a choice, there are some backgrounds that look great with ice cream. Here are some ideas:\n\n\nA wood texture background will evoke home and comfort.\nWhite background. White is a good stand-by background for many food types, as it doesn't crowd out the food and it provides plenty of background light to set off the food.A garden with green colors, or flowers as the backdrop.\nA dark background can set off the ice cream subject perfectly, especially when you see nothing but the ice cream.\n\n"}

Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer.\n\n\nGo slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you\u2019re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you.;\n, Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment that sounds genuine. Otherwise, she might think you\u2019re trying to \"game\" her.\n\n\nGirls like compliments as long as it doesn\u2019t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you.Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes.\nRemember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you\u2019re not.\nDon\u2019t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty for a brunette\u201d is not a compliment.Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful.\n It not only lets her know that you\u2019re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn\u2019t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she\u2019ll be more likely to open up to you., If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal.Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet., Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do., Make sure that she knows that you really want to get to know her better. Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better.Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you\u2019re thinking about her. You don\u2019t need to be some extreme version of yourself that doesn\u2019t really exist. Just be \u201cnormal.\", Nothing major. It can be something small like a snack item that you see her eating often. Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her.\n\n\nDon't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn\u2019t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it., If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects. You don\u2019t want her to think you only like her as a friend. You want to make her feel special, not like just another member of your group"}

In those cases, you can heat the avocado in the oven to help soften them. Preheat the oven to 200 F (93 C).\n\n\nThe oven is superior to the microwave for ripening avocados rapidly. The microwave can leave the avocado mushy and tasteless.An avocado that\u2019s softened in the oven won\u2019t have the same buttery flavor that a truly ripe avocado does, but it will be softer and easier to peel, cut, and mash., Baking the avocado in the oven will help it to produce ethylene, which is a gas produced by many plants that promotes ripening. To trap that gas and help the avocado soften, wrap the avocado in aluminum foil.Instead of using foil, you can also place the avocado in a baking dish with a tight-fitting lid. This is particularly useful if you're trying to soften multiple avocados.\n Place the avocado in the oven and bake it for an hour. Any less and the avocado won\u2019t be soft enough to pass as ripe. When the hour is up, remove the avocado from the oven. Give it a gentle squeeze through the foil to test for softness. Return the avocado to the oven for 10-minute increments if it still feels firm.\n\n\nWhen the avocado is soft and gives to gentle pressure, set it aside and let it cool in the foil.\n Once the avocado has cooled to the touch, about 30 minutes, remove the foil. Now that the avocado is soft, you can cut it, mash it, or add it to any of your favorite dishes."}

If your rod breaks into 2 parts or more, the joint where the sections fit together is called the ferrule. The male ferrule inserts into a female ferrule.The handle is also called a grip and is where you hold the rod.\nThe butt it the thick part of your rod closest to the handle. The tip is the most flexible part of the rod and is located at the very top of the rod.\nGuides are the rings that go all along the rod that guide your fishing line.;\n, Wipe both pieces down with a cloth to remove any dirt or debris that could scratch it. Use necessary, use a cotton swab to clean the female ferrule.By keeping the rod clean, you\u2019ll extend the life of it. Dirt can scratch and destroy the pieces that hold the rod together.\n Align the female and male pieces on a flat service. Holding the female ferrule securely, anchor the male ferrule around it. Always ensure that if necessary, any guides to help secure the ferrules are properly aligned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your rod is not coming together, stop immediately. Look at the instructions. Is there a locking mechanism of any sort you\u2019re missing? If you force the rod together, you risk damaging it permanently.\nOn most rods you will need to rotate the pieces together. Do this by holding the female ferrule and rotating the male piece while they are adjoined.This will lock in your rod.\n While looking at the bottom of your rod, you should see a female opening to insert your reel. This is called the reel seat. Insert your reel.Now put the reel seat, which acts like a smooth handle, over the butt end of the reel. It will thread onto the reel. Rotate until the pieces all feel secure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe cautious not to over tighten the reel. If you force the threading to turn past what it is built for, it can crack and ruin the rod.Remember with threading that right is tight and left is loose. When looking at your rod from the back end, threading right will tighten it. In other words, rotating clockwise will tighten the thread, while rotating counter-clockwise will loosen it.\n The bale arm is the silver overhead piece on the reel. When applying a small amount of pressure, you will be able to flip it up to the other side of the reel. After lifting the bale arm, you will be able to pull the edge of the thread and the reel will unravel it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse caution here. If the bale does not lift easily, you may be looking at the wrong piece. You should never have to strong-arm your bale up.\nCheck that the spool of line unwinds the same direction as the reel turns. If they do not match, you\u2019ll have unnecessary twists and knots. If they are not the same direction, simple flip the spool to have the directions match., Most rods have four to five guides, or eyelets, attached to the rod. Starting at the eyelet closest to the reel, thread it with the line starting at the bottom and coming out of the top. Work your way up to the top of the rod.\n To close the arm, simply flip it the opposite direction as you previously moved it.To test that it is closed, gently pull the line. No more line should come out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest the direction of the spool again by reeling in a small amount of line. If the reel does not rotate the same direction as the spool you\u2019ll need to start over after fixing the direction of the spool., Depending on the sun and cloud cover, you may want to pick a different lure. On sunny days, try using a silver lure. The silver will help reflect light and attracts attention.Contrastingly, use a gold lure on a cloudy day. Gold has high reflective properties and will help give off light on an overcast or stormy day., Pick your lure style based off what kind of fish you are aiming to catch and where. If you\u2019re fishing in freshwater, try a jig. A jig will work well in fresh water by using feathers and a metal head to attract fish.A spoon lure will work well for fish that prey on small fish. The spoon will wave back and forth to mimic the movement of a fleeing fish, attracting the bigger predators.If you\u2019re looking for an all-purpose lure, try a spinner. A spinner is a metal piece that will spin in the water as it moves. This attracts a lot of attention and should be used in a particularly difficult-to-catch location., If your water is muddy or dirty, you\u2019ll need a lure that makes a lot of moment, such as a spinner or a spoon.These lures create vibrations, so even if the fish cannot see the lure, they can feel it. Comparatively, if the water is clear, an overwhelming amount of vibration and movement may scare off a fish.\n Once you\u2019ve threaded the lure onto your line, leave approximately ten inches, or twenty centimetres, of line on the other side of the lure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince fishing line is so difficult to see, it is often recommend that you practice knot tying with string or shoelaces.\n While your line and lure and laying on the ground, pull the free end of the line back up towards the rest of the line. Loosely wrap the end of the line around the line on the other side of the lure, similar to how a candy cane would have two colors wrapped around another.Stop once you have wound the lines together approximately five times.\n Taking the end of your line, pull it back towards the lure. Next, loop it through the first, big loop, that contains the line. After you loop it through, tuck it once more within itself, so it is coming underneath the line. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Hold the line, as well as the end of the line. Pull them slowly together. This should make the line coil tightly where it has been wrapped, and create a tight knot at the lure.You may need to help the process along by using your fingernails to shuffle the twists down towards the lure. Once the knot is wrapped tightly, clip the excess off the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo correctly wind the knot down, you may find you need to moisten the line. This can be done by moistening your fingertips with saliva and running the line over your finger."}

Warming up and performing exercises regularly will improve your speed, technique, and knowledge of your instrument.\n\n\nTune your instrument every time you play so that you learn the correct notes for the song.\nTry new scales and rhythms in different keys and tempos to prepare for new songs.\nTake care of your instrument with new strings, reeds, drum heads, etc. so that you get the sound you want.\n You should be familiar with the entire song, but you need to know your instrument's part like the back of your hand. Search the internet for a copy of the song without any vocals, if applicable.\n\n\nPlaying with your music player's equalizer can help isolate your instrument. Pump up the bass, or turn up the treble to hear the drums.\n The snare drum is often easiest to hear, so learn the whole snare drum rhythm first. Then add the ride cymbal rhythm, then move on to the kick drum, etc.\n\n\nGet the basic rhythm down before trying any wild solos or drum fills.\n Most songs are composed of several bars of music that are repeated many times. Once you know a few \"building blocks\" of the song you can learn these separately and combine them later.\n\n\nMost parts are either 1,2,4, or 8 bars longs.\nDifferent parts of songs (verses, choruses, bridges, solos) often have slightly different parts that repeat. Learn each part individually.\n To make sure that you can play the song cleanly and without mistakes, start practicing the song around half the tempo you eventually want to play it. As you get comfortable, speed up your play while practicing.A metronome is an invaluable way to practice your rhythm and work your way up to the right tempo.\n This let's you hear if you played each part correctly or missed notes. If you can gather some musicians together, play the song with a full band, where can play your instrument without any guidance or support.\n Improvisation is the act of spontaneously composing new parts over an established song, and is the best way to know if you can play a song. By taking inspiration from the song and adding your own spin, you deepen your connection to the song and make it your own. Remember-- you need to stay in the same key and keep the same rhythm.\n\n\nScales are collections of notes that sound good together and are the basis for melody solos and improvisation. Play around with a scale in the correct key to start improvising. The most common scales in modern music are the major scale and the minor pentatonic.\nIf you keep the same number of beats you can change the speed by doubling or tripping your percussion hits. For example, if a song is in 4/4 (4 beats to a measure), you can play \"double time\" by playing twice as many notes in the same rhythm, making 8/4.\nPlay around to the original song. If you have a recording of the song, play it in the background while you try to invent new parts over the top of it.\n\n"}

But the feet don\u2019t get the message, thus remaining in motion when the child is seated.The second brain structure that is smaller than normal in a person with ADHD is the prefrontal cortex, which is the brain\u2019s hub for conducting higher-order executive tasks. This is where memory and learningand attention regulation come together to help us function intellectually.\n A smaller-than-normal prefrontal cortex with lower-than-optimal dopamine and serotonin means greater struggles to focus and effectively tune out all the extraneous stimuli flooding the brain all at once. The prefrontal cortex influences the level of the neurotransmitter dopamine.Dopamine is tied directly to the ability to focusand tends to be at lower levels in persons with ADHD.Serotonin, another neurotransmitter found in the prefrontal cortex, impacts mood, sleep, and appetite.Eating chocolate, for instance, spikes serotonin causing a temporary feeling of well-being; when serotonin drops low, however, depression and anxiety result. , The jury\u2019s still out on the causes of ADHD but it\u2019s well accepted that genetics play a large role, with certain DNA anomalies occurring more often in people with ADHD. In addition, studies show correlations between children with ADHD to prenatal alcohol and smoking as well as to early childhood exposure to lead. "}

A bathroom break or a walk around your home are the best options.\n This includes homework, unfinished classwork, and projects. Finish your assignments that are due sooner as quickly as you can but still have them neat and presentable. In other words, prioritize your work into two different piles, \"Due Sooner\" and \"Due Later\". Always work on the \"Due Sooner\" pile first. .\n Teachers normally have better impressions of students with better looking papers even if it is not as good as a messy one. However this will not get you better grades unless the assignment is subjective or part of the mark is for neatness and organization. A good impression will make the teacher and yourself more comfortable to talk to each other and let the teacher help you, which, in the long run, will give you a much higher chance with a better grade.\n Did you know that the average person spends up to 4 years of their life waiting? Use any spare waiting time to study. You don't have to be a hardcore nerd, reading out of a textbook in the doctor's office; bring a piece of paper with notes written on them or bring your math workbook and do your homework. Not only will this help you prepare for your test(s), it will also less likely make you bored.\n This is cheating, and you can't get into good universities by cheating. But enjoying a class will actually make the class be and seem class easier\n\n, Even if it is just 5 points added to your grade. When it adds up, you will get a solid 1-2 maybe 3% higher average which never hurts.\n Feeling confident is proven to help to be more serious and make you study harder the night before.\n It is not mimicking if you don't copy their every move and plan. Just asking them how they study is fine.\n You can observe and do the opposite of what they're doing. Maybe even give them a hand in showing them how math is done.\n It takes about 5 minutes for an unorganized person to find their things. Now imagine if you have a lot of homework! A good 20-30 minutes will be wasted if you are not organized. In 20 minutes you could learn a few new words in a new language!\n\n, Nothing beats a better school day when your brain is on full blast and your stomach not growling.\n If not, review them at study hall and/or at home. Reviewing them once a day for 5 minutes will highly increase your chances for remembering them.

It will also be explained to you more clearly while already knowing what you are going to learn.\n Your learning is not limited to a certified teacher. Your friend might understand the subject more than you, or your parents may have majored in math or literature so ask for help!\n\n, It seems pretty obvious, but some students are too shy to get help or just don't care enough to do so.

Foundation will help even out your skin tone, and concealer will hide blemishes and discoloration. The key is to apply each sparingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut a small dollop of primer on your finger and apply a thin layer all over your face.Give it a moment to dry, and repeat the same process with your foundation.\nOnly use concealer where necessary, such as to cover dark spots under the eyes, on blemishes, and to cover spots, flaws, veins, or redness. Apply small dabs of concealer where necessary, then blend with your finger.To set everything in place, consider applying a thin layer of finishing powder, which will help your makeup last longer and prevent oiliness.;\n, The tricks with blush are choosing the right color, applying it in the right spot, and not putting on too much. Take a blush brush and dab it into your blush once or twice only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse sweeping strokes to apply a thin layer to your cheekbones.\nBlow the excess makeup off the brush and then blend the blush into your skin until the lines completely disappear., For a basic everyday look, stick with pink shades, a natural gloss, or a cream lipstick that\u2019s similar to your natural lip color. The trick with lipstick is to blend it into your lips with your finger after applying it, because this will soften the look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you find you\u2019ve put on too much lipstick and want to get some off without starting over, take a piece of paper and give it a kiss with your full lips. Don\u2019t blot lipstick with facial or bathroom tissue, as these leave white fibers on your lips., With a liquid or pencil eyeliner, apply a thin line of liner to the lash line on your top lashes. Try to get as close as possible to the lash line to keep the look subtle. For some extra definition, gradually make the line a little thicker in the middle, but taper it off to a thin line at the inner and outer corners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo extend the length of your eye, slightly extend the liner beyond the outer corner, following the direction of your lashes.\nFor definition on the bottom eye lid, choose a liner that\u2019s lighter than the one you used on the top, otherwise you will create an overly dramatic look. Be sure to keep the line thin and right at the lower lash line.\nInstead of eyeliner, you can also use a thin line of powder eyeshadow as eyeliner., After eyeliner comes mascara, and the trick to mascara is making sure that it\u2019s not so thick that it\u2019s clumpy and unnatural looking. Pull the wand out of the bottle and, starting at the base of your top lash line, zig zag the wand back and forth across your lashes as you work your way toward the lash tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a subtle look, only apply one or two coats. If necessary, go back with a clean wand or brush to brush out any clumps.\nIf you like, you can also apply a coat to the bottom lashes in the same way, but make sure it\u2019s a light coat.\n You can wear a full face of makeup without overdoing it, and this even includes wearing eyeshadow. But to do this, you must use colors that complement your undertone and that are appropriate for your skin tone, and you must blend all the colors together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a color for your eyeshadow and select a base shade, a lighter shade, and a darker shade.\nApply the base shade all over your entire upper lid, then do a couple swipes with the lighter shade just below your brow. Use the darker shade in the crease to add definition. Blend all the colors with a clean brush.\nIf you are going to wear eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara, be sure to apply them in that order.\n You don\u2019t want to draw your eyebrows on, as that will look overly dramatic and noticeable. Instead, you want to give some extra depth, shape, and color to them. Use the natural shade and shape of your eyebrows to guide you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a brow pencil that\u2019s similar to your natural eyebrow color, apply short strokes of color to your eyebrows, then work the color through with an eyebrow brush or comb., If you went with a natural look for your eyes, you can get away with a brighter and bolder choice for your lips without overdoing your makeup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteer clear of darker colors like brown and magenta, and instead go with brighter reds and pinks.If you're going for a bold color, apply the lipstick with a lip brush, as this will prevent streaks, which are much more noticeable with a bright color., Your undertone is the color of your skin beneath the surface layer, and this never changes. Some colors complement each other better than others, so choosing makeup that doesn\u2019t match your undertone can make you look ill, and it can make your makeup look very apparent and unnatural. Plus, your makeup won\u2019t flatter your features the way it should when it\u2019s the wrong color.\n\n\nWhen you have a cool undertone, you tend to burn quickly in the sun, look best in silver jewelry, and have blue veins at the wrist.When you have a warm undertone, you tend to bronze in the sun, look better in gold jewelry, and have green veins at the wrist.\nNeutral is the third undertone, and this means you'll look good in gold and silver, and will have blue-green veins at the wrist., When choosing a foundation, you want it to match your skin and complement your undertone. Using a foundation that\u2019s the wrong shade will make your makeup look obvious and fake. Similarly, with a concealer, opt for a shade that\u2019s just one or two shades lighter than your foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a lightweight foundation as well, otherwise your makeup will look thick and pancake-like. Lightweight foundations come in the form of liquids and powders. To identify them, look for words like \u201clight,\u201d \u201cbare,\u201d and \u201cnude,\u201d which denote that the foundation will provide light coverage.\nWhen testing foundations, test it on your jawline to make sure it will match the skin on your face and not stand out against your neck.\nLook for foundation in shades of cocoa, porcelain, rose, or sable if your undertone is cool. Go for golden, tan, caramel, chestnut, or beige if you're warm. If you have a neutral undertone, opt for nude, buff, ivory, or praline., One of the best ways to avoid overdoing makeup is to choose eyeliner and eye shadow colors that are neutral or that only have a hint of non-neutral color.Moreover, if you go neutral and natural with your eyes, you can get away with a bolder color on your lips, and vice versa.For instance, brown eyeliner will be less dramatic than black, but you can use a red-brown if that color complements you and brings out your eyes. And if you stick with neutral browns for the eyes, consider a brighter and more vibrant shade for your lips.\nTo choose colors based on your undertone, stick with blues, purples, greens, beiges, pinks, and berry colors if you're cool. If you're warm, go for earth tones in reds, yellows, browns, greens, and peaches. People with neutral undertones can wear all these colors, but the most complementary will be raspberries, lemons, and lavender shades., Just as the colors in your clothing outfits should match or complement each other, so too should your cosmetics colors, especially when it comes to blush and lipstick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo wear blush and lipstick without overdoing it, it\u2019s important to choose makeup shades based on how fair or dark your skin is. The paler your skin, the lighter your makeup should be; similarly, the darker your skin, the darker your makeup can be.\nFor fair skin, try blush and a complementary lipstick (in the same color family) in plum or light pink. For dark skin, go for tangerine or raisin. For olive skin, try rose or bronze."}

The cloth will give your hamster extra traction so that he can easily walk up and down the tube.Do not make the incline so steep that your hamster will have trouble walking up or down the tube.\n Use non-toxic glue, rather than tape, to attach the walkway to the second floor box. Securing the walkway will ensure that it does not move when the hamster walks up or down the tube.If the opening is rounded, use scissors cut the bottom of the opening into a straight line.\n\n"}

Put the cat down in a place where it's allowed to be. Avoid yelling at the cat.\n\n\nDon't punish your cat once you've removed it from the crib. It should go off to a place where it's allowed to be.\n If your cat returns to jump in the crib or you find it in there later, say \"no\" and remove it from the crib. You'll need to remove your cat every time you find it in the crib so it associates jumping in the crib with being removed from the crib.\n\n\nAvoid letting the cat nap in the crib or it will become confused about when the crib is off-limits.\n Another way to startle your cat into avoiding the crib is to spray the cat with water or an unpleasant-tasting spray. Buy bitter apple spray from a pet store or fill a spray bottle with water. If you see the cat jump into the crib, immediately spray it with water or the scent. Your cat will become startled and will begin to associate jumping into the crib with being sprayed.\n\n\nSome argue that spraying your cat is an effective way to prevent it from jumping in the crib, but others believe that it can damage the bond you have with your cat and increase its stress level."}

Lean meats, whole grains, and nutritious vegetables are an essential part of any good weight-loss regimen, as well as effective at helping to metabolize the beer you consume. If you're full, you'll also be less likely to drink more and eat unhealthy bar food.\n\n\nNever drink on an empty stomach. The toxic impact of alcohol is increased if there's nothing else going through your digestive tract. Plus, the hangovers are way worse. Always eat something before you have beer.\nEating healthy food before you have a couple drinks will also help you avoid the temptation of late night bad food cravings. The Drunk Munchies are a major cause of beer bellies, so if you want to avoid the gut, you also need to avoid the midnight fourth meal.\n Many dieters make the mistake of skipping breakfast when they're trying to lose weight, but the truth is that eating within an hour or so of waking up helps to jumpstart your metabolism, helping to keep your blood-sugar levels constant throughout the rest of the day, making exercise more effective and making you more energetic.\n\n\nTry to eat at a regular time each day, starting the morning with a breakfast high in fiber, with whole grains, fresh fruits, and healthy protein like eggs or natural peanut butter. Try to avoid processed sugars and cereals, as well as starting the day with refined carbs.\n Focus on consuming less high-calorie fatty food, the type of which you find in bars and we all find ourselves craving after a few brews. Hot wings, pizza, and burgers are all fatty, caloric bombs. Replace these types of meals with lean meats, fish, and fresh vegetables as much as possible. Avoid fried foods, cheesy meals, and red meat as much as possible.\n\n\nWhen you're drinking, it's often tempting to have some snacks. Instead of reaching for the easily-available bar food, though, take some unsalted nuts, or fresh fruit with you to the bar, or keep carrot sticks available at home, to avoid the salty chips and fatty cheese sticks that you might normally gravitate toward.\n Legumes, beans, lentils, and nuts will help to keep you full, provide you with the protein necessary to stay healthy and energetic, and will help you lose weight more quickly than if your diet consists largely of meat, eggs, and dairy, helping to cleanse your kidneys and liver, as well as upping your metabolism.\n Cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and other hearty green vegetables are excellent foods to introduce into your beer-belly-reduction diet.Aside from providing an excellent supply of fiber and micronutrients, these super foods help to cleanse these organs that bear the brunt of the alcohol you consume.\n\n\nThe kidneys and liver work hard to process the alcohol from your system, and treating them right will help keep your metabolism up, helping you lose weight much more quickly. Eating these foods on a regular basis and cutting the alcohol from your diet will have that belly dropping inches much more quickly., Refined sugars, carbs, and fatty snacks are the enemy of your waistline. High in calories and in calories from fat, these will make it very difficult to lose that beer belly, even if you're consuming fewer calories from beer.

Your friends know you and care about you, and it\u2019s a red flag if everyone but you is skeptical of your new love.;\n, As with your friends, your family can help you discern whether your crush is a good fit for you and whether what you\u2019re experiencing is love. Love builds you up and is long-lasting. Lust or a passing crush fades, and your family can help you tell the difference.\n\n\nAsk your parents, grandparents, or aunts and uncles how they knew that they found the right person. Their unique stories might help you get a better understanding of whether your own situation is love or something else.\n When being around this person makes you want to be the best person you can be, it is a sign of love.\n\n\nFor example, if this person makes you want to better yourself by working out or taking up a mutual hobby that interests both of you, it\u2019s a sign that you love them. Wanting to improve yourself for someone often means that you love them.\nNote that this is not the same as loving someone who is trying to change you into someone you\u2019re not. It\u2019s healthy to want to better yourself to be the best possible partner for someone you love. It\u2019s a red flag if someone you love is trying to force you to change instead of loving you for you.\n When you accidentally hurt someone you love, you will apologize and mean it. If you don\u2019t really love the person, your apology might feel half-hearted. Truly wanting forgiveness and meaning it when you apologize is a sign that this person means a lot to you and you\u2019re in love., Once you\u2019re past the initial \u201ccrush\u201d phase, if you find that you can be yourself around this person, that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re in love. When you can let down your guard and that person still accepts you as you are, you can be confident that you\u2019re in love.If you feel comfortable enough to leave your makeup at home or wear pajamas for a movie night, for example, that\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re comfortable being yourself in the relationship and secure with your love.\n\n"}

You can dip your fries into the ketchup or squeeze some over a pile of fries, depending on your preference.While traditional tomato ketchup is the classic option for pairing with fries, you can also find a variety of flavored ketchups, such as chipotle or sundried tomato ketchup.\nA popular variation of ketchup that is often served with French fries is fry sauce. It is a mixture of 1 part ketchup with 1 part mayonnaise. You can also add a couple of dashes of hot sauce if you want to make it a bit spicy.\n French fries are often paired with burgers, so any condiment that you usually put on your burger can make an ideal dipping sauce for your fries. Try dipping them in mustard, mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, or steak sauce if you\u2019re tired of the usual ketchup.Ranch, blue cheese, and 1000 island dressings are other condiments that may make tasty dipping sauces for your fries.\n Because fries have a fairly neutral flavor, you can really dip them in any sauce that you like. Tartar sauce is usually reserved for seafood, but it\u2019s mayonnaise-based so it pairs well with fries. If you like spicy food, try dunking your fries in sriracha or buffalo sauce for added heat.A classic aioli, which is essentially a mayonnaise that\u2019s heavily flavored with garlic is an ideal dipping sauce for your fries if you want to give your meal an elegant twist.\n\n"}

These include the bench press, pull ups, rows, dips, etc. Compound movements target multiple muscle groups at once, rather than isolating a single muscle. They also help you become stronger, which will increase the amount of specialized arm training you can perform.A solid training program with compound exercises as its foundation will allow you to build a balanced, functional physique, rather than a merely aesthetic one.\nA simple way to organize your workouts is the traditional bodybuilding split, in which you train two or three related muscle groups during a given workout (for example, a \u201cpush\u201d split would focus on chest and triceps, while a \u201cpull\u201d split would utilize the lats, deltoids and biceps).;\n, When it comes time to emphasize the biceps, pick one or two exercises to include at the end of your workouts. Some good choices are EZ bar curls, preacher/concentration curls and cable curls. The biceps are smaller muscles and only have a secondary function in the compound lifts, meaning they\u2019ll need to be trained directly more often if you want them to grow.Wait until you\u2019ve finished your strength-focused compound movements before getting into higher volume accessory exercises.\nThe biceps are stubborn when it comes to increasing their size. They require quite a bit of isolation work with high numbers of sets and repetitions.\n Following a grueling chest workout, dedicate some time to working your triceps. Lifts like skull crushers, overhead tricep extensions and close-grip pushups are efficient at singling out the triceps muscles, which serve to extend the arms. As a bonus, tricep-specific training will add pounds to your bench press and ratchet up the number of dips you can bang out.The triceps are the single largest muscle group in the upper arm, so developing your triceps goes a long way toward building massive arms.\nContraction of the triceps is key to all major pushing movements.\n What good are sculpted biceps and triceps if your forearms remain the same size? Luckily, it\u2019s easy to benefit the lower arm muscles while doing compound exercises that challenge your grip, such as deadlifts, pull ups and farmer\u2019s walks. Thick, powerful forearms complete the impressive appearance of a svelte physique.Any exercise that requires you to hold onto heavy weight for a lengthy period of time will be effective at building your forearms.\n There\u2019s a lot of debate about whether it\u2019s better to focus on strength or volume (the total amount of work you do) in order to build muscle, but in reality you need both. Build your strength levels by performing 3-4 sets of heavy compound lifts (bench press, weighted dips/pull up and row variations will all do the job), then switch your focus in the latter part of the workout to doing multiple sets of higher reps for your accessory work.Though training methods differ slightly, there is a close relationship between strength and size. Being able to lift more weight means you can lift heavier weights more times, driving up your total volume and, in turn, your mass-gaining potential.\n One core principle for building muscle mass that has stood the test of time is that of \"progressive overload\"\u2014continuing to challenge yourself and see results by adding weight or volume (or both) over time. If you can perform an exercise for 10 reps with a given weight one week, set your sights on 12 reps the next, or stick with 10 reps while using a heavier weight. This way, you can program progress into your training by guaranteeing that you're always pushing yourself to do more.Progressive overload is most effective when you take small steps consistently: one extra rep here, a couple additional pounds there. Trying to add too much weight or volume at one time makes you more likely to fail, which can be discouraging and lead to plateaus.\nCycle between adding weight and adding volume to steadily maximize your growth potential., Sidestep the common pitfall of overtraining by dedicating only a single workout to training your arms during the week. On \u201carm day,\u201d pick 2-4 lifts each for the biceps and triceps and do each lift for 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps. Many people make the mistake of trying to do too much. This means they\u2019re just breaking down muscle without giving themselves time to rebuild it.A typical arm workout will consist mostly of bicep curl and tricep extension variations that hit the muscles at slightly different angles.\nSchedule your dedicated arm session right before a rest day to give yourself at least 24 hours to recover.\n No matter what exercise you\u2019re performing, always work through a full range of motion. Go from full extension to full contraction with each repetition, and make each part of the lift smooth and controlled. By using a greater range of motion, you put more strain on the muscle fibers. The physiological response to this stress is what causes muscles to grow.Studies have demonstrated that a full range of motion stimulates significantly more muscle growth than partial movements.Prevent injury to your joints by stopping just short of lockout (hyper-extension).\n As a general guideline, select a weight you can lift 8-15 times in a set while doing isolation exercises. With each contraction, blood will be forced into the muscle, causing it to become firm and engorged. This is commonly referred to as a \u201cpump.\u201d Not only will getting pumped make you look bigger, it also plays a role in muscle growth by transporting valuable nutrients to the muscles while moving waste products out.Squeeze the muscle tight at the end of each rep to pump as much blood into it as possible.\n Take one or two days off every week. Rest is integral to the muscle-building process because it gives your body a chance to catch up and repair itself. Get quality, restful sleep at night and do a little light cardio or stretching to help ease soreness. Once you\u2019ve had some time to rest, you\u2019ll be ready to hit it hard when you get back in the gym.In most cases, soreness is a good thing. It\u2019s a sign that muscle tissue that has been broken down is being built back up.Get to bed on time. Most of the body\u2019s growth and repair takes place while you\u2019re asleep.\n Your diet should contain an ample amount of protein from lean, natural sources. Some foods that are high in protein include lean cuts of meat, fish, eggs, nuts, legumes, tofu and dairy products like milk and yogurt. The body takes whole proteins and breaks them down into amino acids, which are then used to construct new muscle tissue.Try to get somewhere around 1 gram of protein for every 2 pounds of your body weight (if you\u2019re 160lbs, for example, that\u2019s roughly 70-80g per day).Think of protein as the payment your muscles receive in return for all the work they perform.\n In addition to the protein you get from food, consider using protein shakes, bars or other supplements to increase the total amount you receive each day. It can sometimes be difficult to hit the numbers you need to grow, especially if you\u2019re not all that hungry. A fast-absorbing whey protein shake will offer an extra 25-40 grams per serving, giving you a decisive edge when it comes to piling on size.Having a shake during or immediately after a workout provides much-needed protein to feed and replenish your muscles.Protein supplements can also work as meal replacement options when you\u2019re in a pinch. Have a protein bar before you go to bed or during times when you know you won't be able to eat for a while to keep your muscles stocked with a steady supply of amino acids.\n In order to grow, you have to eat. This means going hard at the dinner table as well as in the gym. Aim to consume a moderately sized meal or protein-rich snack 4-5 times a day. Let all the major nutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, healthy fats, fiber) be represented in your daily intake. A lot of people trying to add muscle don\u2019t get the results they're after because they simply don't eat enough.The exact number of calories you should ingest depends on many different factors, such as height, weight, body composition, metabolism, and activity level. Trust the expertise of a physician or nutritionist to recommend an optimal amount of calories to help you gain muscle.\nExercise is only half the battle. No matter how hard you\u2019re working out, if you don\u2019t get enough to eat, you won\u2019t get any bigger.\n The amount of calories you receive is important, but what form they arrive in also makes a difference. Choose lean meats, fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains over french fries and milkshakes. Not only do wholesome foods contain more vital nutrients, they\u2019re also generally lower in calories, which means you can eat as often as you need to without having to worry about going hungry.Feasting on candy, fried food and other junk can cause you to exceed your ideal calorie threshold fast. Since these foods are so dense with calories, you can easily eat way too much of them before you feel satisfied.\n\n"}

The bases themselves tend to be gymnasium mats (thereby the reason why this game is called Matball).\n Crossing that imaginary line makes the kicking player automatically safe. Most often times, this imaginary line is centered at the direct center of the area of the gymnasium floor - all so that the kicking player can have room to take action on the ball when it arrives.\n, The kicker can either kick the ball and begin running the bases, or they let it slide past and into whatever is behind them. However, the outcome of missing this ball can be deemed to be either an out or just a miss, but must be based solely on the umpire or other officials officiating the game.\n They can either run to the right (much like the current game of baseball) or towards the left and run from base to base until they reach home.\n You can have many players on one single mat.\n\n\nSometimes, game officials give the teams an ultimatum when they reach base, in hopes that they are not called \"out\" at any time (outs are discussed a little later). They can continue running in hopes not to get stopped by any one baseball fielder near the mat, or they can stop and safely rest on the mat.\nRecognize what should happen in the case the player oversteps a base (even by just one foot). Most often times the game official gives players the opportunity to lead with their one lead foot, however, they must not come off the base or they can be thrown out to be considered \"out\". Most often times, once you leave a base, you can't return again to that same base.\n Games vary from location to location and include (but are not limited to) these two universally-accepted rules.\n\n\nIf the ball is kicked behind home plate, it is considered to be a foul ball.\nIf the ball hits the ceiling of the location traveling forward, it is either a foul or out (dependent on location rules).\n An out for a player is recorded when either the player has swung their leg and missed on several attempted kicks or when they swing and kick but the fielder catches with their hands, when the running player gets tagged while running the bases or during an altercation in the game that causes the out.\n If the location's doors are open in front of home plate and the ball heads out the doors, some places consider the ball to be live at all times until the fielding team retrieves it, or it may be considered a home run. Sometimes if the game is played indoors inside a gymnasium and there are basketball hoops that have been raised and the ball travels into or through the baskets, it's an automatic home run, but that's only a general advisement and not a required idea to determine.\n\n\nRecognize that there are more scenarios than what are posed here, but vary widely upon each individual situation the location encounters.\n, Sometimes, interference can be called in the field when some members of the fielding team are playing their position in or near the basepath and/or to a certain extent so that the running player must collide with them to get to their next base. If this error is recorded, the player can safely be marked as safe on the next base, and the player who committed the error must sit out until the next inning or till the end of the game and can't be up to bat unless these players are elementary school age and are just learning the game.\n, Sometimes, as long as theirs a ball in play and their is a runner on a base (or is running the bases) these teammates can continue running the bases. However, if you want, you can tell the teams that they have to stop after (x) amount of runs.\n After several outs have been recorded by the kicking team, the side is out. If all players reach base without leaving any other players behind, you may end up waiting for someone to make a mistake and have all players leave their bases, but that won't happen very often.\n Repeat this play after the two teams switch places (the kicking teams becomes the fielding team and the fielding team becomes the kicking team).\n The team at the end of a few rounds or the one to record the most runs will win and the game will be over.\n"}

These symptoms include:\n\n\nPain: It will intensify when you put your weight on the bone or do physical activity, and will decrease when you rest. The pain is often described as sharp and pulsating.\nTenderness in the area of injury: When a stress fracture occurs, the area around it becomes inflamed. The swelling and injury will make the area around the fracture very tender.\nBruising in the area: When you blood vessels break because of a force or blow, your skin will form a bruise. Blood leaks out of the blood vessels and results in red, black or purple skin mark.\nMuscle spasms or numbness: When the muscle fibers in the injured area stretch or get torn, the muscle fibers contract at the same time and tight. This results in insufficient blood flow to the affected area. This leads to spasms and an odd feeling or numbness in the affected area.\n Some activities, conditions and lifestyle choices can put you at a higher risk of getting stress factors. If you are concerned about stress factors, or have had one in the past and would like to prevent it in the future, it is helpful to know the risks. They include:\n\n\nBeing an athlete. Sports like tennis or track that require the repetitive stress of your foot striking the ground causes trauma that can lead to stress fracture.Increased activity. An abrupt increase of activity in your life when you are moderately out of shape can lead to a stress fracture.\nHaving foot problems. People with foot problems can be more vulnerable because of an unequal distribution of force on your feet.\nOsteoporosis.

You can't build wealth if you don't save money, and you can't save money if you don't know what you have and how you spend it. You probably already know the basics of how to do a budget \u2014 and if you don't, click on the link above \u2014 so we won't bore you with the nitty gritty. The big picture to remember is that setting a reasonable budget that you can stick to and learn from is a huge (!) step towards the ultimate financial independence.;\n, How much you set aside is up to you. Some swear by 10% to 15%, others by figures a little higher.But the younger you start saving, the more time you spend saving, and the less you probably need to put away. So start saving early, even if you're only setting aside 10%.\n\n\nAnother rule of thumb that people use is the rule of 8x. This rule of thumb recommends that you save 8 times the salary you have by the time you retire. By this yardstick, you'd do well to have 1x your salary saved by age 35, 3x your salary saved by 3X by 45, and 5X by 55.\n Few things in life are free, and money is not often one of them. In fact, money is so rarely free that you really have to grab the bull by the horns when it comes along. Here's one situation in which people earn \"free\" money:\n\n\nEmployers sometimes match 401(k) plans. This means that for every dollar of your salary that you put into your 401(k) plan, your employer will put in another dollar from their pocket. Hypothetically, if you contribute $2,500 to your 401(k) and your employer matches, they'll also pay out $2,500 for a total of $5,000. That's the closest thing to \"free\" money you'll probably ever get. Take advantage of it.If you want to learn more about 401(k) plans, click here. A 401(k) plan is retirement account where the money you put into it is tax deferred, meaning it's not taxed until a later date or possibly not at all.\n Like a 401(k), a Roth IRA is a retirement account that gets invested and potentially isn't taxed. There's an individual limit to how much you can contribute to your IRA annually ($5,000), but a goal you might have \u2014 especially in your 20s and 30s \u2014 is to hit this max contribution every year.\n\n\nHere's how effectively a Roth IRA can help you build wealth. If a 20-year-old person contributes the maximum $5,000 to their IRA every year for 45 years at 8% annual growth, magic things happen. By the time they retire, they'll have a portfolio of over $1.93 million.That's $1.7 million more than if you'd just stuck that money into a regular savings account.\nHow do Roth IRAs produce such wonderful wealth? Through compound interest. This is how compound interest works. A bank or other institution gives you interest on your IRA, but instead of pocketing that interest, you put it back into your pool. Then, the next time you get interest, you're not only gaining interest, but interest from your interest as well.\nAs with all savings vehicles, the earlier you start, the better. If you make a one-time contribution of $5,000 at age 20 and then let it sit for 45 years at 8% growth, you'd have a whopping $160,000. If, on the other hand, you make a one-time contribution of $5,000 at age 39, by retirement age that $5,000 would only be about $40,000. So start early!\n\n, While credit cards can be incredibly useful in some situations, they can promote really bad financial behavior in others. That's because credit cards can encourage people to spend money they don't have, to push very real worries farther out into the future until they finally become unavoidable.\n\n\nNot only this, scientists have discovered that the human brain thinks about credit and real money very differently. One study found that credit card users outspent cash users by an average of 12% to 18%, while McDonald's found that people who pay with plastic spend an average of $2.50 more in their stores than their cash counterparts. Why is this?\nWe don't know for sure, but we think that cold, hard cash feels a lot more like \"money\" than credit cards do, perhaps because the money isn't physically present when you swipe the card. In short, credit can feel like Monopoly money \u2014 fake \u2014 in the primitive part of our brains.\n When the government issues a tax refund at the beginning of the year, many people go on a spending spree. They think, \"Hey, here's this windfall. Why don't I spend it and have some fun with it?\" While this is a perfectly acceptable thing to do on occasion (and given good circumstances), it doesn't exactly help you build wealth. Instead of spending the tax refund, try to save it, invest it, or use it to pay off significant debts that you have. It may not feel as good as spending it on a new set of deck chairs or a rebuilt kitchen, but it will help you achieve your goal of preparing for the future.\n We know saving is hard. Incredibly hard. By its very nature, saving is deferring present pleasure for future gain, and that's a courageous act. By tilting your head and looking at the process from a different angle, you can motivate yourself to be a much better saver. Here are a couple pointers:\n\n\nWhenever you make a bigger purchase, divide the cost of the item into your hourly wage.So if you're eyeing those $300 pair of shoes, but you only make $12/hour, that's 25 hours of work, or more than half a work week. Are the shoes worth that much to you? Sometimes, they will be.\nCut your savings goals into smaller chunks. Instead of setting a goal of saving $5,500 per year, think in terms of months, weeks, or even days. Think, \"Today I'm going to try to save $15 and put it away.\" If you do that for every day of the year, that will turn into $5,500.\n Have you ever heard the phrase \"It takes money to make money?\" Well, when it comes to a good financial planner, that's often the case. A financial planner will cost you money, especially if she's a good one. But the idea is that she'll ultimately make you more money than she charges. By that measure, it's a good investment. It will help you build wealth.\n\n\nA good financial planner does a whole lot more than manage your money. She teaches you about investment strategies, explains short- and long-term goals, helps you develop a healthy emotional and rational relationship with wealth, and tells you when to spend some of your hard-earned shekels.\n Investing your portfolio is crucial if you want to build, and not just maintain, your wealth. There are tons of different ways to invest, and investing in the stock market a good financial planner will be able to guide you in the right direction. Here are some ways to think about investing:\n\n\nThink about investing in an index. If you invest in the S&P 500, for example, or the Dow Jones, what you're doing is betting on the American economy to succeed. Many investors think that dumping money into an index is a relatively safe and smart bet.\nThink about investing in a mutual fund. A mutual fund is a collection stocks or bonds that are bundled together to pool risk. While they tend not to make as much money as dumping all your money into one or two stocks, it's much less risky.\n You may think that you can make a killing off the stock market by buying low and selling high each and every day, but time will eventually catch up to you and prove you wrong. Even if you marshall solid business fundamentals, industry health, or other value-investing tenets when making your picks, what you're doing is essentially speculating, or gambling, instead of investing. And when it comes to gambling, the house almost always wins.\n\n\nA mountain of academic research has found that day trading is not profitable.Not only are you incurring big transaction fees each and every day, but you're usually only seeing 25% and 50% increases \u2014 if you're lucky. It's very hard to time the stock market correctly. The people who simply choose good stocks and leave their money invested for long periods of time usually make far more money than people who flit back and forth buying and selling.\n For a long, long time, United States stocks and bonds were the most lucrative thing you could invest in. Now, emerging markets are offering more growth in certain sectors.Investing in foreign stocks or bonds will round out your portfolio and give it the risk reduction that you might not otherwise find.\n Investing in property and real estate can be a lucrative way to boost your wealth, but not necessarily. The class of people who believed that the value of real estate would only increase lay at the heart of the Great Recession of 2008. People soon found the values of their houses plummeting as credit became severely pinched. Since the market stabilized, many more are again jumping into the housing market as a means to build wealth. Here are some tips you can use if you do choose to invest in property:\n\n\nConsider buying a home you can afford and building equity in it instead of paying rent. Buying a mortgage is probably one of the single most expensive purchases you'll make in your life, but that shouldn't dissuade you from buying a home you can afford if the financials make sense. Because why pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in rent to a landlord with no property to show instead of building equity in something that you can one day fully call your own? If you're financially ready to own a home (they cost a lot of money to upkeep), this can be a sound move.\n\nFlip homes with caution. Be wary about flipping. Flipping is when you buy a house, quickly upgrade it for as little money as possible, and then put the upgraded house on the market so that you can make a profit. Houses can be flipped, and some have done so profitably, but houses can also founder on the market for a long time, become money pits, or simply cost more than someone is willing to pay for them.\n This is one of the hardest lessons people attempt to learn as they learn more about personal finance. Live within your means now in order to live above your means later. If you live beyond your means now, expect to live below it in the future. For most people, it's easier to move up the ranks comfort instead of down.\n You may want that brand new car after you see your best friend driving downtown with a slick pair of wheels, but that's your emotional half talking, not your rational half. Here's what you do if you feel the emotional impulse to buy something that your rational half knows you maybe shouldn't:\n\n\nInstitute a mandatory waiting period. Wait at least a week, possibly even to the end of the month when you have a better idea of what your finances will be. If you still want to buy the item after a week or longer, it's probably not an impulse buy anymore., Several studies have shown that people who shop while they're hungry buy more than they need as well as more caloric foods.So eat before you leave to go grocery shopping, and make a list. Then, at the grocery store, only buy the items on your list, giving yourself one or two exceptions. That way, you'll buy what you need, not what you think you may need. Remember, research suggests that approximately 12% of what you purchase at the grocery store will end up thrown out anyway, so do not add to the expense of purchasing items that you will not eat.\n Instead of buying one box of Kleenex that you know you'll run through in a month, get smart and buy a year's supply. Retailers heavily discount items bought in bulk, passing the savings onto you.And if you're really looking for the most bang for your bulk, check out prices online before you buy in person. Online prices are often much cheaper because retailers don't have to pay for as much labor or show space \u2014 only warehousing.\n If buying lunch costs $10 on average and bringing lunch only costs $5 on average, that's a savings of $1,300 over the course of a year. That's more than enough to start a small rainy day or emergency fund in case you suffer any unexpected costs or lose your job. Of course, you want to balance thriftiness with sociability, so carve out a little time and money to eat out with your co-workers every once in a while.\n Refinancing your mortgage can shave thousands of dollars off your monthly payments over the life of the loan. Especially if you started off with an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) and your interest rates have gotten more expensive to deal with, you should consider refinancing.\n If you find that your skills limit your earning potential consider going back to school. Trade school and community colleges have so much more to offer for your dollar. If your interest lies in the computer industry, for example, many community colleges offer computer certification tests.\n\n\nThe tuition and fees are usually less expensive and the training consumes less time than traditional degrees because you don't have to take basic courses like math, English and history to get a technology or skills degree! As a bonus you can take many required courses for a two year degree online.\nAlso, it's worth noting, you shouldn't underestimate the power of an associates degree. After all many employers just want to see that you can finish your program and be self-motivated to improve yourself, while others just want \"the paper.\"\n\n, Don't be afraid of office politics; \u201cscratching\u201d someone else's back an in order to have yours \u201cscratched\u201d could be a very good thing.\n Keep tabs on community endeavors such as the local chamber of commerce and the Small Business Association. Spend time volunteering there, talking with members, and giving back to your community. Just like with networking, you never know how you might impact a life, or how they might impact yours. It pays to have a lot of lines in the water when fishing.\n After learning the delicate dance of scrimping and saving, of sacrificing for your future, it's good to remind yourself that once in a while, it's good to spend. Because, after all, money isn't an end in itself. It is a means to an end, and its true value lies in what you can buy with it, not in how much you have by the time you die. So learn to treat yourself to life's simple and not-so-simple pleasures once in a while \u2014 a ticket to Verdi, a trip to China, a pair of leather shoes. That way, you can also learn to enjoy life while you're living it.\n\n"}

Tinned/canned tuna, cod, and haddock are, in contrast, not oily fish.A serving size of oily fish consists of 3.5 ounces (100 g).\n Though farmed salmon does indeed contain omega-3 fatty acids, it\u2019s overall less nutritious than wild salmon\u2014for example, it contains only an eighth as much vitamin D, and only a third as much vitamin A. It\u2019s also fattier, meaning that it collects and stores significantly more contaminants and toxins than its wild counterpart does.Many places, such as the E.U. and the U.S., require manufacturers to label farmed and wild fish, as well as to identify whether or not dye has been added. In other places though, like Canada, this explicit indication is not required by law., Mercury exposure can disrupt and destroy neurological and organ health, and it\u2019s particularly harmful to young children and fetuses. Indeed, the U.S. government estimates that as many as 75,000 newborns each year are at higher risk of developing learning disabilities later in life due to mercury exposure in the womb. You can limit your exposure to mercury by cutting out your consumption of predatory fish, such as shark, king mackerel, and tuna.Even if you\u2019re eating wild salmon, don\u2019t eat more than two portions a week, as it can still contain pollutants harmful to you and your baby, such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).\n Raw fish (such as sushi, sashimi, ceviche and carpaccio) and refrigerated smoked seafood should be avoided due to the risk of food poisoning or listeria poisoning. Make sure that all fish is refrigerated promptly after purchase and consumed within one to two days. Always cook seafood to an internal temperature of 145\u00b0F (62.8\u00b0C)."}

Before making a commitment, you want to know how much you could sell the asset for in today's less than desirable economy and compare that amount to the seller's price. If the 2 figures are somewhat close, further consideration of the acquisition may be worthwhile.;\n, Depending on the nature of the asset and how the economy is affecting the value of that asset, there is a chance that the market value will either increase or decrease over the next year or so. Look beyond this short-term shift in value, and attempt to determine what the asset will be worth several years from now, taking into consideration all known economic factors. This will give you some idea if the acquisition will ultimately generate profits or will end up posting a loss that could undermine the ability to hang on to your other assets.\n If the purchase involves buying a company, determine if some of the holdings of the business could be immediately sold after the acquisition to offset the cost of purchase without harming the core operation and its ability to generate revenue.\n Should that company currently owe debts that would be transferred to you in the event that the acquisition take place, make sure that debt would not be enough to cripple your current financial status.\n Even if the projected risk is somewhat low, you still want to acquire the asset for the best possible price. Make a counter offer that is slightly below current market value and continue to incrementally raise that amount until a price is reached that both the buyer and seller can agree upon.\n\n"}

Step forward with one foot, stepping one foot a normal walking step ahead of the other. Instead of lowering your foot all the way down to the ground, touch just your heel to the ground with your toes flexed toward the ceiling. Gently lower your toes toward the ground, but don't touch the sole of your foot to the ground. Raise your toes back up and return to your beginning stance.\n\n\nDo 10\u201315 reps on this side.

They contain hundreds of thousands of mites and eggs.Crusted scabies is rare and typically seen in patients with suppressed immune systems\nBe particularly vigilant of these symptoms if you have been in contact with anyone infected with scabies.;\n, It is important that you visit your doctor. Over-the-counter and home remedies will not treat the infestation completely.The doctor will usually only need to see the rash to diagnose the condition. He might also take a sample by scraping under the bumps and looking for the presence of mites, eggs, and feces under the microscope.\nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are pregnant or have any problems such as serious illness, or other severe skin diseases.\n If your itching is severe, you may want to treat it on your own while waiting for your doctor's appointment or prescription. Soaking in cold water or applying calamine lotion may provide relief from itching.You can also use over-the-counter oral antihistamines, such as cetirizine (Zyrtec), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl).\n Once diagnosed, your doctor will usually prescribe a mite-killing cream or lotion containing five percent Permethrin. Always follow your doctor's and pharmacist's instructions exactly when using the cream.\n\n\nPermethrin is topically applied and has a few side effects such as burning/stinging and itching.Permethrin only kills mites and not ova (eggs), so a second application is necessary for treatment. Two applications at least one week apart (this is how long it takes an egg to hatch) is the minimum treatment required to make sure it is eradicated.\nFor people with a severe infestation and weakened immune system, doctors may prescribe Ivermectin as an oral treatment. Ivermectin is an oral medication. It is generally used for crusted scabies and taken as a single one-time dose. Some doctors may prescribe a second dose after one week. Side effects of Ivermectin include fever/chills, headache, loss of appetite, joint pain and rash.Your doctor may prescribe other creams instead of the Permethrin. These include Crotamiton 10%, Lindane 1%, or sulfur 6%. These are less common, and are used if a patient has failed treatment with Permethrin or Ivermectin. Treatment failure is frequent with Crotamiton. Side effects of Crotamiton include rash and itching. Lindane is toxic if overused or misused. Side effects of Lindane include seizures, and rash., Several herbs are traditionally used for treating scabies. There is little proof that these remedies are effective \u2014 most evidence is anecdotal, or people saying they were helpful, but there is no scientifically backed evidence to support their use. Currently the only proven remedy is prescription medication. Do not rely on these treatments alone. Talk to your doctor before trying any herbal remedies, including the following:\n\n\nDevil's horsewhip or prickly chaff flower (Achyranthes aspera)Neem (Azadirachta indica)Karanja (Pongamia pinnata)Turmeric (Curcuma longa)\nBlue gum or camphor oil (Eucalyptus globulus)Fig bark powder ('Ficus carica, Ficus racemosa, Ficus benghalensis), Wait a while for your body to cool down some from the shower before applying your medication., Unless a medical professional advised you otherwise, start behind the ears and from the jawline and work your way down. Apply using cotton wool swabs, a paintbrush, a sponge, or any item supplied with the treatment for the purpose.\n\n\nContinue rubbing the cream downward, over your entire body.Avoid the eyes, nose, and mouth area, but apply everywhere else. You must cover your genitals, soles of your feet, between your toes, back, and buttocks. Get help for areas you're not able to reach yourself.\nAfter covering your body, take care of your hands. Apply between the fingers and under your nails. You will need to reapply the cream to your hands every time you wash them.\n Leave the lotion or oil on your body for the amount of time directed. This is usually between eight to 24 hours.The length of time you'll need to leave the medication on your skin will depend on the product and your doctor's instructions.\n Once the allotted time is up, wash off the medication under a warm shower.Be aware that you may remain itchy for a few weeks after the treatment.\n\n\nThis is because your allergic reaction to the mites continues while the dead mites bodies remain in the skin. If it's concerning you, speak with your doctor again.\n All household members need treatment on the same day, even if they aren't showing signs of scabies. This will prevent reinfestation.Don't forget visitors to your house. This includes family members staying for any length of time, babysitters, and other visitors.\n The cream is usually one application with a repeat application after seven days. But, this will depend on your doctor or pharmacist's instructions. Be sure to follow the prescription.\n\n\nYou'll probably have a check-up visit in a few weeks to address your progress.You're not done yet. Cleaning your house the same day you use the treatment is vital for preventing a new infestation.Keep reading for instructions.\n To prevent reinfestation after treatment, it's vital to thoroughly clean your home the same day you applied the treatment. A scabies mite can live for one to three days off the body.Cleaning will ensure that remaining mites are killed.\n\n\nDisinfect the floor and bathroom surfaces by mopping (you only need to do this after the first treatment).\n\nVacuum floors, carpets, and rugs. Dispose of the bag or contents in an outside trash can immediately and dispose of as quickly as possible.Bleach the mop after each clean.\nIf you can steam clean the carpet.\n Wash bedding daily until you\u2019ve not seen new bumps for at least a week.Wear disposable gloves when stripping beds.\n\n\nIf you have a heavy comforter, you can place it in a airtight bag for 72 hours.Dry clothing and bedding in a hot dryer or on the clothesline in hot weather under direct sunlight. Dry cleaning is also appropriate.\nPut blankets in the dryer before bed every night until you're certain the infestation has ceased.\n Store clothes that you cannot wash in the airtight bag for 72 hours to one week.The same approach will work for stuffed animals, brushes, combs, shoes, coats, gloves, hats, robes, wetsuits, etc. Vacuum bags are widely available that are airtight and take up little space.\nBag all clothing the moment you remove it.\n If you're still itching after six weeks, this can indicate that the treatment has not worked. See your doctor for more advice and new treatment options.\n\n"}

This is especially important if you're needing to have a conversation about a difficult subject.You want to choose a private moment rather than make something a public event. So if there's some sort of problem, having it out with your significant other in front of the entire family on Christmas eve isn't going to be conducive to communication.Likewise, picking a time when you're both grumpy or already upset (on a long drive, for example) is going to make the other person less likely to hear you.\n While you don't necessarily need to write down your talking points word for word, it's a good idea to know what points you want to touch on. This is especially important if you're shy or tend to have more difficulty thinking on your feet.This can also keep you on track during a conversation itself, because you'll be better able to remember the things that you need to talk about.\nAsk yourself questions, such as \u201cWhat is the solution I\u2019d like to see here?\u201d or \u201cWhat are other ways I could feel heard?\u201d\n\n, While this ties in with the picking the right time and place, it's important that you tell when someone is open to hearing you. If they aren't, it rarely matters what you say or how you say it. If someone isn't open to hearing you, they aren't going to hear you.Their body language language can communicate a lot to you. If they're turned away from you, not making eye contact, or their arms are crossed across their chest, then they're likely feeling defensive, or not wanting to listen to you.\nIf they are being aggressive, or angry, then it's going to be very difficult to get them to listen to what you're saying. In that instance, it's best to remove yourself from the situation as best as possible.\n When you're trying to get someone to hear you, you need to make sure that your body language is communicating that. Do your best to avoid shutting down conversation by paying attention to what your body language is saying.If you can sit next to the person you're trying get to hear you. Make sure that you keep enough distance between you and them so it doesn't feel like you're crowding them, but close enough that there's a connection between you two.\nKeep your tone of voice and your body language as neutral as possible. Avoid crossing your arms across your chest, or balling up your hands into fists. Keep your chest as open as possible.\nMaintain eye contact with the other person. This will help you to judge how they're feeling, and whether they're still listening to you, and it will help keep a connection between the two of you.\n You're trying to engage the other person without shutting them down. If you shut the other person down straight off the bat, you're going to find it next to impossible to get them to hear you. What you want to do is make this discussion a shared inquiry rather than an accusation.As an example you could say something like \"I have a problem, and I'm wondering if you can help me with it\" and segue into explaining that you need help taking care of the kids.\nA second example might be something like \"I'm confused, I'd really like it if you could try to help me understand\" and then go on to explain that you feel that there's a distance between the two of you and you'd really like to work on bridging that distance.\n Anger tends to be a mask for something deeper and more vulnerable, like fear or pain. When you launch directly into anger you're shutting down the avenues of conversation rather than opening them up.Vulnerability, while much harder (and scarier) to express, is more likely to be heard. This means, though, that you're going to have to share your hurt in a more thoughtful manner.\nThis is why \"I\" statements are so incredibly important. You're explaining why you're hurt or why you're upset. For example: \"I was hurt when you forgot to pick up the dry cleaning, because it felt like my important recital wasn't as important as getting home and putting your feet up\" is so much better and more open than \"You always forget to do things. I guess you just don't care about this important recital!\"\n\n, A conversation and being heard is not a one-way street. You can't count on someone being willing to listen to you, if you aren't willing to listen to them. It can be hard to hear things about yourself or about the relationship that clash with what you've been thinking, but if you want them to hear you, you have to hear them.\n\n\nHear what the other person has to say. If you're not willing to listen when your significant other explains their side \u2014 \"I forgot to pick up the dry-cleaning, because I've been so stressed about our child's failing grades in school\" \u2014 then you're not going to get anywhere.When the other person is talking, cultivate active listening. If you space out or get absorbed in your own thoughts, ask them to repeat what they just said. Look them in the eye when they talk and pay attention to what they're saying, rather than focusing on what you're going to say next.\n Important conversations, getting people to listen to you, opening up when you're hurt or upset. All these things can be incredibly difficult and emotionally draining. If you can approach them with humor, you're more likely to get further.After all, people tend to be more open to listening to you when you\u2019re humorous about the situation than when you\u2019re emotionally charged.\n You can't always be heard. You just can't. It doesn't matter if you do everything \"right.\" You set the stage, you pick the right time, you stay neutral instead of getting angry. Sometimes people aren't ready for what you have to say, and sometimes they'll never be.\n\n\nIf someone cannot or will not hear what you have to say on an ongoing basis, you may need to reconsider whether it's worth having a relationship with them.\n\n"}

This is a very serious mental disorder that can be life-threatening if left untreated.Think of someone who you trust and confide in this person about how you have been feeling. Talking to someone allows you to share the burden of depression. Admitting that you need help is also a very important step towards getting better.\n\n\nYou might approach your best friend, a teacher or coach at school, or a parent and explain what\u2019s going on with you. \u201cHey, lately I\u2019ve been feeling really, really low and having a lot of negative thoughts. I can\u2019t eat, sleep, or concentrate. I think I may need to see a doctor.\u201d Just be straightforward but clear that you think your condition is serious and requires expert attention.;\n, Once you have identified a need to see an expert, you can either go directly to a mental health professional or request a referral from your primary care physician. Getting treatment for depression requires confirming the diagnosis first. Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms, your medical/psychiatric history, and your family history to better understand your situation., After your doctor has confirmed that you have depression, you can sit down and discuss your options for treatment. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to treating depression\u2014you may try several approaches before you find the treatment that suits you best. In general, people find success when combining the following treatments:\n\n\nMedications-- Antidepressants may be prescribed by your doctor to help improve your depressive symptoms.Medications proven to be effective at treating teen depression include serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These medications help increase a brain chemical called serotonin to improve the symptoms of depression. However, keep in mind that SSRIs have a black box warning (the most serious kind) because they can increase suicidal tendencies for teenagers.Psychotherapy or counseling-- There are many forms of therapy used to treat depression. However, research shows that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is extremely effective at challenging negative thought patterns and encouraging positive thinking.You may have to attend several weeks or months of therapy to thoroughly address teen depression.\n Various studies show that when people get together to discuss their symptoms and share tips for overcoming depression, they all benefit.If you are a teen with depression, it may be helpful to join a local or online support group where you can share your experiences with others who are also fighting this condition.\n\n\nAsk your doctor or therapist about local support groups or search for one in your area or online by visiting the Anxiety and Depression Association of America., When do you feel really happy? Listening to music? Writing? Reading? Watching television? Start creating a depression-fighting toolbox by thinking of activities that make you feel better. Engage in these activities regularly to cheer yourself up and fend off negative thought patterns.\n\n\nBe sure that you fill your toolbox with healthy activities. Teens may have a tendency to use junk foods, alcohol, or drugs to offer a mood boost while feeling depressed. However, self-medicating in this way will only worsen your depressive symptoms in the long run.It's normal with depression to no longer have an interest in doing things you once enjoyed. However, the only way you can get back to feeling better is to move around and spend time doing things that lift your mood. Challenge yourself to participate in one or two activities that you used to like and then write down how you felt doing them.\nTry doing creative or artistic activities, such as painting, writing poetry, playing music, or knitting to help you express yourself and feel happier.\n You can further maximize on the benefits of doing what you enjoy by asking a friend to come along. When you are depressed, you might be tempted to withdraw. However, participating in social activities can actually improve your mood. So, invite a friend to participate in a fun activity with you to double the positive advantages.\n Go for a hike in nature. Sit on a bench and just get a bit of sunlight. Take your dog for a walk around your community. Research has shown that people who spent 90 minutes in a natural setting as opposed to an urban, city-like setting experienced a decrease in depressive symptoms., Depressed people often feel hopeless that their lives will get better. However, when you have a clear list of what you want out of life, you may be more enthusiastic about waking up and reaching your goals.\n\n\nMake a list of major and minor things that you would like to accomplish in your life. Write down whatever comes to mind\u2014you can always edit your list as your circumstances change. Then, set some concrete goals to realize those bucket list items.For example, you may write down \"travel to Africa\" on your bucket list. If so, come up with some things you can do starting today to help you reach that goal. Perhaps, you can start a savings account or apply for a study abroad experience.\n Know your thoughts. Learn to distinguish between good and bad thoughts, positive and negative thoughts, and even whether the things you think about are truth or lies. When you become more aware of what you are thinking, you can take action to shift your thought patterns into a more positive direction.\n\n\nOnce you have started to monitor your thoughts and identify which ones make you feel bad, attempt to challenge negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones.\nFor example, you might say to yourself \u201cI\u2019m a total failure.\u201d Try to cross-examine this statement with questions like:\u201dWhat evidence do I have that this is true? Not true?\u201d\n\u201dHow might I view this situation differently if I weren\u2019t depressed?\u201d\n\u201dWhat would I say to a friend who said something like this?\u201d\n\n\n\n, Try to get a better understanding of your thoughts and feelings by journaling. Write about any painful emotions that you experience. Instead of holding upsetting thoughts or feelings in, unload them onto paper. Journaling is actually a positive activity that can lead to better mental health.Take your journaling one step further and come up with strategies to problem-solve the negative thoughts and feelings you are having. How can you improve your situation? If you notice patterns in what you are complaining about on a daily or weekly basis, brainstorm ways you can take action to minimize these issues.\nYou can also test negative thinking by looking for evidence to counter your negative thoughts. For example, if you find yourself thinking, \u201cI will always fail. I will never succeed at anything,\u201d then try to think of evidence that counters that thought. This could be past successes you have had, no matter if they are small or large. You might think back to a time when you got a good grade on a test, or when you had a really fun night with your friends. You can even think back to something from a really long time ago to counter your thought, such as learning how to walk.\n Find practical ways to decrease stress and take it easy on yourself as you are fighting depression.\n\n\nMany teens have tons of responsibilities such as completing school assignments, doing chores, participating in extracurriculars, and even managing part-time jobs. If your current obligations are becoming too much to handle, try to say \u201cno\u201d more often when someone asks you to do something extra and cut back on your responsibilities if possible. For example, maybe you can cut back on your hours at your part-time job, or just be part of one after school club instead of three.\nTry to find some time to relax every day as well, such as by meditating, doing yoga, or doing deep breathing exercises.\nOther ways to reduce stress include managing your time to do homework and chores effectively, breaking big projects or tasks down into smaller, more manageable parts, and being aware of when you are taking on too much. Seek support when you become overwhelmed rather than withdrawing from loved ones.\n As a teen, it's natural to want to stay up later talking on the phone or browsing the web. Surprisingly enough, however, teens usually need more sleep than adults to support developing minds and bodies. Sleep deprivation can contribute to and worsen the symptoms of depression.\n\n\nTry to get at least 8 hours or more sleep each night. Also, maintain a consistent sleep schedule, going to bed and rising at the same times each day. In addition, be sure to cut off technology a couple hours before bed to improve your chances of getting good quality sleep., Enjoy nutritious, well-balanced meals rather than consuming convenience foods that drain you of energy and worsen your mood. Consume a diet that consists of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. If you fuel your body with the proper nutrients, you can support your mind and body as it heals from depression., The last thing you may want to do when you feel depressed is exercise. However, physical activity can be a powerful antidote for depression. When you engage in exercise, your body produces mood-boosting chemicals called endorphins. Exercise also improves self-esteem and relieves stress.Perform at least 30 minutes of physical activity daily. This can be running, dancing, swimming, hiking, or weight training. Find an activity you like and commit to it.\n You may be surrounded by people who are bossy, who are mean, or who use drugs and alcohol. Find ways to reduce your exposure to people who make you feel bad or who pressure you to make negative choices. Instead, spend time with positive people who are upbeat and supportive.Connect with people who don't judge you. Actively seek out friends and family members who don't place conditions on loving you and who accept the person you are now and the person you are becoming.\n Research shows that teens who are bullied have a greater likelihood of developing depression and substance abuse problems.That's why it's important for teens to know how to respond to bullying behavior and put it to a stop before it takes a toll on emotional and mental health. Follow these tips for handling bullies at school:Assert yourself to let the bully know you will not accept being mistreated. Say something like \"Give it a rest\" or \"Knock it off!\"\nIgnore the bully by not showing any sort of reaction and walking away.\nStay in groups between classes, at recess, and after school to deter bullying behavior.\nReport the behavior to an adult you can trust, such as a teacher, coach, school counselor, or parent.\n Peer pressure happens when classmates or friends influence your behavior or decisions.When peers try to convince you to behave negatively, you may try to refuse which can result in teasing, spreading rumors or social isolation. These consequences are carried out to try to force you to give in to the demands of peer pressure. You can learn to resist peer pressure and the negative consequences associated with it by:\n\n\nPaying attention to how you feel about what's right and wrong\nHaving the confidence to not follow the crowd\nSaying \"no\" when you are asked to do something that you believe is not right\nConfiding in someone you trust like a parent or older sibling\nStaying away from friends who pressure you\n\n, Teenagers have a host of responsibilities with school generally ranking at the top of the list. Plus, the older you get, you are faced with more challenges, such as complex curriculum, juggling school and jobs, and making decisions about college and the future. If you feel like you are reaching a point of burnout or overwhelm, you need to know that it's OK to ask for help.\n\n\nThere are many ways you can cope with feeling overwhelmed by your schoolwork. For example, if you are having trouble focusing in class because you are up late working a part-time job, you may want to reduce your work hours or only work on weekends. If a difficult subject is making all of your grades drop, ask for help from the teacher or a tutor.\nTeen stress is very real, but you can ask for help. Confide in your parents, teachers, or school counselor if you are suffering from feeling overwhelmed. These people can help you learn how to better manage your responsibilities., If you are a loved one who is concerned that a teen in your life may be suffering from depression, it's important to be able to spot the warning signs. If you notice any of these symptoms in a teen, urge him or her to get help. If the person is in denial about depression, alert a parent or other adult who can ensure that your loved one gets professional attention. Common symptoms of teen depression may include:Having low self-esteem\nBeing irritable\nHaving difficulty concentrating\nExperiencing changes in sleep habits or appetite\nFeeling hopeless\nHaving little interest in previously pleasurable activities\nWithdrawing from friends and family\nLosing or gaining weight\nHaving thoughts of suicide\n\n, You can help a friend, sibling, or child who has depression feel better by being supportive and showing compassion. Think about how he or she might be feeling and try to empathize. Say something to encourage your friend like \"I know going to school might be hard, but it might make you feel better. Getting out of your room and socializing might help you feel like yourself again.\" Letting your teen know that you can see what he or she is going through and showing support can make the person feel less alone while fighting depression.\n\n\nYou can also help by joining your teen at doctor's appointments, offering to attend family therapy, or participating in support groups. Learning as much as you can about teen depression can help you gain better insight on how to be supportive and compassionate., All teenagers will encounter difficult personal situations when things aren't going so well at home. Parents separating or divorcing, financial difficulties, death in the family, and an older sibling going away to college can all be upsetting ordeals for teens. What's more, teens also cope with difficulties in friendships and romantic relationships. By building a toolbox of stress relievers, you can help your teen prevent personal issues from turning into depression. You may recommend that he or she:Identify people in your life who you trust and feel comfortable talking to. Surround yourself with positive, uplifting friends and family who value you and what you bring to the table. These people can be a part of your support toolbox. Talk to someone who is usually supportive and caring when you are feeling down. Don't hold things inside.\nDevelop healthy habits to have a wellness component to your toolbox. Be sure to exercise, eat well, and get enough sleep. Taking care of your body and mind is key to getting through tough personal circumstances.\nParticipate in activities you enjoy often, such as reading, listening to music, or playing sports. These can be go-to activities in your toolbox that you do when you are feeling down.\n\n"}

Make sure not to strain your voice (look up tips for saving your voice), but most importantly keep your commands and instructions short and to the point. The video provides more information on voice techniques.\n\n\nIn this example, which would be more effective? A. \"Okay class, I want everyone to pay attention and listen closely to my directions.\" B. \"Oy!\" The answer is \"example B.\" \"Oy\" means \"attention\" and is precisely 13 less words than \"example A.\";\n, An example structure could be moving in closer to the student that is not paying attention, putting a hand on their shoulder, and giving them a \"look\" of disapproval.\n If you're teaching freestyle side breathing, for example, avoid saying: \"Okay, I want you to start turning your head as your pulling hand passes under your body. Then take your breath and start returning your face back into the water as your dominant hand recovers and you begin recovering your other arm.\" Instead, say, \"Breathe, stroke one, stroke two.\" Wasn't that easy, precise, and to the point? And in just 5 words you communicate your message to the entire group.\n Give each student a number or a color. For example, go to each child and say, \"red group,\" next child \"blue group,\" next child, \"red,\" next child, \"blue, etc.\" Since every other child is in an opposite group, you have maximized your space. In large groups, you may even want to go with three groups. In order to maximize practice time, have one group go, and then when that group is 1/2 to 2/3 of the way to the rope or wall, have the other group go. This way you are maximizing practice time and eliminating as much down time as possible.\n Nothing is more important than safety and practice time. By using a flotation device (preferably a progressive one), you can increase practice time and keep your beginners safer.\n Most swim instructors make the mistake of doing all the talking which is a huge mistake when teaching group lessons from both a learning and behavior standpoint. Instead, give yourself and your students an \"edge\" be engaging them in the process. For example, let's say that you want to teach your students the cues/buzzwords for the back kick. Simply state, \"say what I say\" or \"repeat after me:\" \"Ears in the water,\" they repeat, \"Tummies up,\" they repeat, \"Small, fast kicks,\" they repeat. Not only are they learning but by involving them in your presentation, you eliminate many behavior issues.\n\n"}

This will show your employers that you care about the overall well being of the company.\n\n\n\nParticipate in educational and skill-building programs that pertain to your job. Focus on programs that offer education on technological advances, as many of your younger colleagues will have degrees focusing on this. This will help you prevent stagnation in your job position and allow you to remain competitive with newer, younger employees.\n\n\n\nShow your employers that you're indispensable as a senior employee by displaying extra effort at your job. Turn projects in early if possible, stay late or come in early if extra help is needed, and accept requests to work overtime or take on an extra project or task to help out. These are all opportunities to show employers that you have the experience to get the job done.\n\n\n\nFind areas in the workplace where your experience as a senior employee is valuable and capitalize on them. Create a new database for organizing projects that resolves deadline issues, develop new ideas for customer care or implement a new organizational system for employee requests or input. Making efforts like this will improve productivity in the workplace and show employers you're willing to put in the extra effort to do so.\n\n\n\nOne advantage of being a senior employee is having an established network of contacts and colleagues. Keep these business relationships up to date and don't be afraid to use them to give yourself an edge over younger, less connected employees.\n\n"}

Instead, opt for an enameled cast iron or stainless steel option.\n Add 1 pound (454 g) of lean ground beef, 1 cup (150 g) of diced yellow onion, and 2 teaspoons (6 g) of minced garlic to the pot. Saut\u00e9 the mixture until the ground beef is browned and no longer pink, which should take approximately 6 to 8 minutes.Use a wooden spoon to break up the beef and stir the mixture as it saut\u00e9s to ensure that it cooks evenly.\nWhen the mixture is finished cooking, drain any excess grease from the pot if necessary.\n Add 6 ounces (170 g) of tomato paste to the pot.

Read the content you're rephrasing over and over again until you feel you completely understand it.Take notes while reading the content. This way, you'll already be rephrasing it slightly.\nAfter reading each paragraph, pause and restate what was said. Imagine you're explaining the content to someone else.;\n, Unless you're quoting directly, make sure most of the the original diction is cut from your writing. Some words may be unavoidable. For example, if you're talking about a particular science term, you'll have to use that word. For the most part, however, avoid the original words as much as you can.For example, if you're writing about sex determination in chromosomes, you will have to use the term \"chromosome.\"\nSome people think they can save time by simply replacing original words with synonyms. Not only is this likely to sound clunky, it can still be read as plagiarism if you don't change basic sentence structure.\n Imagine you were describing the information to someone unfamiliar with the topic. Describe the content to this imaginary person using your own original words.For example, the original text says, \"Out of the 46 chromosomes found in human DNA, sex is determined by the 'X' and 'Y' chromosome.\" How can you put this in your words? Try something like, \"In humans, DNA is made up of 46 unique chromosomes. The determination of biological sex relies on the 'X' and 'Y' chromosomes.\"\n\n, Even if you've put the content into your own words, you need to source it. Follow the guidelines of the writing style you use (i.e., AP citation, MLA citation, etc.) and cite the source according to that style. Sources are sometimes cited in parentheses within the text or in footnotes/endnotes., After paraphrasing a sentence or paragraph, read the original text. Try to restate the main point in one or two sentences. Then, reread your paraphrased words to make sure the original point is reflected there.For example, suppose the original sentence reads, \"In East of Eden, Steinbeck's characters are caught in a morally ambiguous divide between good and evil.\" The main point here is that characters in East of Eden live in a gray area.\n\nReread your sentence. Suppose it says, \"Steinbeck tries to illustrate how characters choose between good and evil.\" This sentence misses the point, as it glosses over the gray area.\nTweak your sentence to reflect the main point. For example, \"Steinbeck tries to illustrate how his characters exist between good and evil.\"\n\n\n\n, Often, in an effort to paraphrase without plagiarizing, sentences often become poorly constructed and confusing. Read through your paraphrased words and watch out for sentences that are difficult to understand.For example, say you wrote, \"Characters in Mrs. Dalloway all suffer trauma due to World War I, which is illustrated through Clarissa being frightened by a car malfunctioning and more dramatically through the shellshocked Septimus Smith.\"\n\nThis sentence is too long. It should be broken into smaller sentences. For example, \"Characters in Mrs. Dalloway all suffer from trauma due to World War I. This is illustrated when Clarissa is frightened by a car malfunctioning. It is later shown more dramatically through the shellshocked Septimus Smith.\"\n\n\n\n, When striving to rewrite content, it can be easy to inadvertently leave out necessary details. Good paraphrasing should never be vague. Reread your words to make sure you conveyed all the necessary information.For example, say a sentence says, \"The murders occurred in 1991, in a small suburb just outside of Chicago at roughly nine o'clock in the morning.\" You wrote, \"The family was killed near Chicago.\"\nRewrite the above sentence to add the missing details. For example, \"The family was killed in a suburb outside Chicago in 1991. The murders were estimated to have taken place around nine o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n, When you're rephrasing content in your own terms, sentence structure often changes naturally. However, if you find any of your sentences or paragraphs too closely mirror the original work, tweak the structure to avoid plagiarism.Changing structure is a matter of starting with a different idea, fact, sentence, or passage.\nFor example, say a paragraph of literary analysis began by overviewing character relationships before stating a theory on the work's theme. When paragraphing, state the theme first and then talk about character relationships.\n Think about your natural writing voice, tone, and style. Try to write content using your unique voice. This will help you naturally stray from the original content while providing a more engaging piece.For example, take a paragraph that says, \"Even after 40 years, the elephant remembered its training from when it was used in war.\"\n\nBe a little creative when paraphrasing. For example, \"Proving the old adage about elephants never forgetting, the war elephant recalled its training from 40 years prior.\"\n\n\n\n, Sometimes, it's okay to use the original source if your own words aren't enough to convey necessary information. If you decide to quote directly, use block quotes and quotation marks. Then, cite the source according to the guidelines you're using for your paper.Make sure you don't quote too much, however. When writing, it's important to put some content in your own words rather than merely restating the work of other writers.\n There are many online tools that help you check for plagiarism. Just to be sure, copy and paste your words into an online tool like DupliChecker or Copyleaks. These tools will screen your words to make sure they do not too closely mimic existing content."}

It is perfectly normal to be sad and upset about the situation, and not know what to do, but it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t drift away from your friend. Even if you don\u2019t know what to say or how to react, make an effort to reach out and show your friend that you are there.\n\n\nJust sending a short note or email at first saying you have heard the news and are thinking of them can help your friend feel a bit less alone.You could say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry this has happened. I\u2019m thinking of you.\u201dIf you don\u2019t know what to say, it\u2019s okay to admit this. Say \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to say, but I want you to know that I care and I\u2019m here for you.\u201d;\n, Everybody is different, but someone who has just been diagnosed with cancer will probably be feeling very lonely. It\u2019s very important that you clearly show that you are there to support and help in any way you can. You can express your support by saying \u201cPlease let me know how I can help.\u201d\n\n\nJust being a good listener can make a difference to somebody. Say something like, \u201cIf you want to talk, I\u2019m there for you.\u201dWhile you should offer to listen, you shouldn\u2019t press her to talk or pass on more information to you about the diagnosis.\n In your letter will you want to show that you are there to help in any way you can. This support can be practical as well as emotional. In some cases practical help can be a big help to a friend suffering from cancer. Offering to do everyday tasks such as helping to look after children and pets, or washing and cooking, can really help somebody who is tired or feeling weak.\n\n\nKeep in mind that your friend may not want to feel that she is putting you out by asking for something.\nTry to help in a way that looks casual, even if it isn\u2019t.\nFor example, if you are offering to pick the kids up from school, you could say \u201cI\u2019m always in the area when they finish school, and could pick them up on the way home.\u201d\nDon\u2019t just say, \u201cwould you like me to pick up your kids from school?\u201d, It\u2019s important to express encouragement and not be pessimistic or too downbeat. It can be difficult to find the right balance, as it\u2019s equally important not to display false optimism or downplay the seriousness of the situation. Acknowledge the situation, but always express your support and encouragement.\n\n\nYou could say, \u201cI know this is an incredibly difficult journey you are on, but I am here to support you and help you in any way I can to help you get through it.\u201d, Depending on your friend and your relationship, humour might be a good way to show encouragement and support while also helping your friend smile. This can be difficult to achieve in a letter when you are not able to judge the reaction and body language of the other person.\n\n\nFor example, joking about something like hair loss can be a good way to relieve stress.Use your judgement, and if in doubt avoid making any jokes in the letter.\n You might know someone who has been through cancer, but you shouldn\u2019t try to relate that experience to your friend\u2019s diagnosis. Try to avoid sharing stories about people you know who have suffered from cancer, and remember that each case is different.\n\n\nInstead you can let your friend know that you are familiar with cancer up to a point, and let your friend decide whether or not to ask you to elaborate.Saying something like, \u201cmy neighbour had cancer and he came through just fine\u201d is not that likely to reassure your friend.\nYou may give the impression that you are detracting attention from her, when you are trying to show support and solidarity., You might think you are expressing support and solidarity, but unless you yourself have been through cancer, you do not know how your friend will be feeling, so don\u2019t say you do.If you say something like \u201cI know just what you\u2019re going through,\u201d or \u201cI really know how you feel\u201d it might seem like you are not taking it seriously enough.If you try to equate your friends diagnosis to a difficult period is yours or somebody else\u2019s life, it can come across badly and be insensitive.\nIf you know somebody who has been through cancer, you can mention this and offer to introduce them, but don\u2019t push it.\nYou can just say, \u201cI have friend who went through cancer a few years ago, if you like, I can put you in touch.\u201d, You might think it is helpful to offer advice on how to deal with cancer, or how somebody you know was helped by some alternative treatment. Your friend, however, will not want to read a long story about something that doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with her. Offering advice about something you have no clear experience of us, no matter how well meaning, can appear insensitive. Leave the advice to the doctors.This is also not the time to ask questions about your friend\u2019s lifestyle or habits.\nMaybe your friend is a long-time smoker, who you spoke to about lung cancer countless times. That doesn\u2019t matter now. Just focus on supporting her and being sensitive., While it is important to be positive, you shouldn\u2019t say something like \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll get through it no problem.\u201d You may just be trying to show support, but what you say might be interpreted as belittling the seriousness of situation. You may not know all the facts about the diagnosis and the prognosis.Don\u2019t push your friend to reveal more about the prognosis than she has already.\nRather take the time to educate yourself as much as possible independently.\nYou can talk to friends or family to find out more information, but respect your friend\u2019s privacy at all times."}

However, any attempts at contacting your ex will only dredge up painful feelings for one or both of you, and it will only prolong the inevitable. Remember that you broke up for a reason: one or both of you were fundamentally unhappy, and that won't change.If your ex's phone number was saved on your cellphone, delete his/her contact information and delete any previous text message conversations or phone call records on your phone.\nErase, blot out, or discard any physical copies you've written down of your ex's phone number (like from an address book, for example).\nConsider blocking your ex from contacting you on your cellphone. Generally this is done by going into settings, clicking on privacy, and blocking the number of your ex, though the exact method will vary depending on the type of phone you have.\nTurn off your phone any time you plan on drinking alcohol (if you meet legal drinking age) so that you do not text or call your ex in a moment of weakness.;\n, Some people are able to remain friends with an ex. However, if you don't think you can be friends without having romantic feelings for him/her, it may be best to cut off all ties with that individual. Even if you've deleted your ex's phone number, you may still be able to send your ex private messages or comment on photos and status updates.Unfriending/unfollowing your ex on social media will help remove temptation to contact that individual. It can also provide you with space and privacy while you heal from the breakup.\nRemember that if you remain friends on social media, you'll have to see whom that individual is in a relationship with in the future. You'll also be generally reminded of your time together, which may create feelings of longing.\nRemember that you can always send your ex a friend request or follow him/her in the future, once you've gotten over the breakup. If you're feeling vulnerable and may try to contact your ex, though, it's best to cut that individual out altogether for the time being.\n You may not need to do this, but some people may find it helpful to create some distance between mutual friends while the breakup is still fresh. If you think you might be tempted to ask a mutual friend to \"report\" on your ex, or if you cannot separate the emotional associations of your ex with your mutual friends, it may be best to create a little space until you've healed and moved on.Let your friends know what you're doing and why. If you don't communicate with them, they may worry that you've decided not to be friends with them as individuals.\nIf your mutual friends bring up your ex around you, ask them to stop doing so, at least until you've healed from the breakup.\nAvoid any situations or social events where your ex may be present. For example, if your mutual friends host a party or invite you to an event, ask them in advance whether your ex will be there.\n The best way to heal yourself emotionally after a breakup is by accepting that the relationship is over. This may be difficult, especially if you were the rejected partner, but recognizing that it could never work out is important.Until you have found some sense of closure, you may continue to feel temptations to call or text your ex, and doing so will only prolong the suffering and emotional vulnerability you're feeling.\n\n\nIt's okay to feel pain and sadness - these feelings are normal. But dwelling on those feelings or convincing yourself that you've lost your \"one true love\" will only delay your healing.\nRecognize that it's okay to be alone for a while. You can find other exciting ways to fill your time, and once you've taken time for yourself you'll be ready to begin an even better relationship with someone new.If you're still thinking fondly about your ex or hoping for some type of reconnection, you haven't found closure yet. It's vital that you avoid contacting, seeing, or even accidentally running into your ex during this time in order to heal and move on.\n If you're coming out of a long-term relationship, especially with someone you shared a house or apartment with, being alone may feel scary or intimidating. The best way to get over your ex (and distract yourself from any temptation to call him/her) is to be around other people as often as you can.Reach out to friends and family members, even if you haven't seen them or heard from them in a while. It's okay if you have to initiate the planning; the important thing is not to be alone.\nTry taking up a new hobby or enrolling in a class, and ask a friend to try it out with you. This can be a great distraction from your feelings and a good bonding experience between you and your friend.\n After a long relationship, you probably have a lot of physical objects that remind you of your ex. These may be little gifts and shared objects, and seeing them everyday can be a constant reminder of your past relationship. Getting rid of (or at least hiding) these objects that remind you of your ex can help you feel less compelled to contact your ex in the wake of a breakup. Box up anything that reminds you of the other person. Whether it's photographs, gifts, or belongings that he/she left behind, it's best to keep them out of sight.\nIf you can't keep these sentimental reminders in your home without dwelling on your ex or feeling tempted to contact him/her, throw them in the trash. Just be sure to arrange for a mutual friend to return any belongings that your ex may want back before you throw anything out.\n Sometimes moving on from a breakup can be difficult. Even after removing the sentimental reminders of your ex, you may find yourself thinking about him or her on a regular basis, and that may give you the urge to contact your ex. If you're having a hard time moving past the breakup, making some changes in your routine or your life in general may help.If you shared a house or apartment, move out and find a new place in a different neighborhood.\nIf you work together or used to work together, consider looking for a new job.\nIf you don't want to leave your job but you still work together and share space, ask your boss if you can change desks to be farther away from one another.\nFind other ways to change up your routine and your physical surroundings. Do whatever you can to make subtle changes in your life and erase all reminders of your ex.\n Whether you were the person who initiated the breakup or your actions/behavior led to your ex breaking up with you, you may be carrying around some guilt. It's important to accept the past and move on in order to heal. Remember that no matter how guilty you may feel, your ex certainly played a role in things falling apart - and that's okay. Moving on means learning how to love yourself and forgive yourself for your mistakes. Eventually, once you've forgiven yourself, you may be able to forgive your ex as well., Every relationship has its ups and downs. Couples often fight, and sometimes things are said that shouldn't have been. However, if your partner has abused you (emotionally or physically), cheated on you, or otherwise neglected your feelings throughout the course of your relationship, there's a good chance that that individual would not make a good friend.Toxic people who have hurt you and may continue to do so in the future should be cut out of your life.This is best for your getting over that ex as well as for your general mental health and wellbeing.\n Some people never stop feeling some type of attraction towards another person. That attraction may be physical or emotional, but it can make friendship very difficult. If you don't think you can talk to your ex or be in the same room with him or her without wanting to reconnect on some level, you'll need to accept the fact that you just can't maintain a friendship with that individual.If you're having trouble moving on, make sure you cut off all ties completely and at once.\nAny time you catch yourself thinking about your ex, make a point of doing something fun and distracting. Go out with friends, watch TV, or find other ways to snap out of that mindset.\n Being friends after a breakup almost always requires time and distance apart. You cannot transition from a relationship to a friendship without time to process and heal (if you're able to at all).If you think you can get over the breakup and ultimately become friends with your ex, you'll need to evaluate your feelings towards that person and consider how much time has passed since the breakup.Most people feel sad, lonely, or hurt/betrayed in the wake of a breakup. This is normal, and these feelings will pass with time.\nThere is no universal waiting period for getting over a relationship. For some people it can happen in a week or two, while for others it may take months to get over an ex.\nIf you still feel any kind of longing or resentment towards your ex, not enough time has passed.\nOnce you can think about your ex and not miss him/her or get angry about the breakup, you may be ready to consider transitioning to a friendship. If this doesn't happen, though, you may need to cut your losses and move on without your ex in your life.\n\n"}

Usually, emotional hunger comes on suddenly and feels urgent. You may be able to only think about eating and satisfying your craving right away. This is different than physical hunger, which usually comes on gradually, unless you haven\u2019t eaten in a long time.When you are emotionally hungry, you may also crave specific comfort foods, such as fatty foods, foods high in carbs, or foods high in sugar. You may also find yourself eating without thinking, where you eat a whole bag of chips or several pieces of cake without paying attention to what you are doing.\nAfter an episode of emotional eating, you may not feel satisfied or even full. You may try to eat more and more until you are uncomfortably full. You may also feel a sense of regret, guilt, or shame after you have eaten. This may be because you realize you are eating for emotional reasons, rather than nutritional reasons.;\n, Though emotions come into play with binge eating, binge eating usually involves eating unusually large amounts of food within a specific amount of time. Individuals with a binge eating disorder often feel they cannot control their behavior and eat even when they are full or not hungry. They may also eat rapidly during binge episodes and eat alone or in secret. They may have feelings of shame or guilt while they are eating or after they have eaten.Many people with a binge eating disorder are overweight or obese, through you can also be at a normal weight and have this disorder. Individuals who binge eat may try dieting and weight loss programs frequently but have a hard time maintaining a healthy weight due to their disorder.\nUnlike bulimia, individuals who binge eat do not vomit up their food, use laxatives, or exercise excessively to get rid of the food they just consumed. Often, binge eating occurs due to certain triggers and a binge eating episode can last several hours, depending on the severity of the episode.\n To stop your emotional eating, you first need to determine the root causes or triggers of your eating. Identifying possible causes will then help you to better manage them and prevent you from eating emotionally in the future. Common causes of emotional eating include:Stress: Stress can be a big trigger for emotional eating, as high levels of stress leads to a spike in your hormones and your cortisol levels. Chronic stress can make you crave salty, sweet, and high-fat foods to give you a burst of energy and relief.\nIntense feelings and thoughts: Feelings like anger, fear, sadness, anxiety, loneliness, resentment and shame can all lead to emotional eating. You may use eating as a way to numb yourself from these emotions or to avoid processing these emotions.\nBoredom: Being bored and unoccupied can lead to emotional eating, especially if you also feel unfulfilled and empty. You may try to fill this void with eating.\nChildhood eating habits: You may have memories of food from when you were a child that are attached to negative feelings or from being taught to view food as a reward. Maybe your parents always gave you ice cream or sweets when you behaved properly or took you out for pizza when you did well academically or needed a pick me up.\nSocial pressures: If you tend to use food as a way to connect with others socially, you may have an emotional relationship with food. Though getting together with friends for a meal is a good stress reliever and often a good way to enjoy food, it can also lead to overeating. You may overeat in social situations due to nervousness or as an attempt to blend in with everyone else who is eating. Your family and friends may also pressure you into overeating or indulging in unhealthy foods during your meals together.\n To get a better understanding of your emotional eating triggers, you may want to keep a food diary. Write down your meals for the day as well as how much you eat, when you eat, how you feel when you eat, and how hungry you felt. Be specific and consistent about keeping the diary as this may allow you to recognize patterns in your eating. These patterns can help you better understand how your mood affects how much you eat and what you eat.For example, you may notice that every time you come home from work after a long day, you eat a whole bag of chips or a pint of ice cream. This could point to a pattern of emotional eating that is triggered by the stress in your workplace.\n Sometimes it can help to talk to those close to you about your eating habits as a way to understand your habits better. It can be hard to recognize your own emotional habits, especially around food. Do not be afraid to talk to your close friends and family about your struggles with eating. Ask them if they think you may eat based on emotion and if they notice any triggers or patterns in your behavior.You should also see your family and friends as support systems for you to lean on as you work to stop your emotional eating. Rather than feel ashamed or embarrassed by your eating, you should try to be honest about your struggles and talk openly about them to those you trust around you. This will help you feel less guilty about your eating and help you feel supported.\nIt may also help to eat in front of your friends and family, especially if they have healthy eating habits. Choose healthy options when you eat with family and friends and try to model your behavior after their healthy eating habits.\n Though you may be able to recognize your triggers on your own through self analysis and through talking to those close to you, you may also want to reach out for a professional opinion on your eating. You can talk to your family doctor about your emotional eating and get a referral for a therapist. You can also talk to a counselor at school or in the workplace.You may need to be assessed by a mental health professional before you can enter therapy or counseling. The therapist may also give you diet suggestions to help you stay healthy as you work through your food triggers and the causes of your emotional eating.\n To get a better handle on your diet, you should sit down and write out a grocery list before you head to the grocery store. Consider choosing four to five healthy meals for the week and writing down the ingredients for these meals so you know exactly what you are getting and do not impulse buy when you are at the store. Think about the nutritional value of the items on your list. Go for more fruits, vegetables, healthy sources of protein, and healthy sources of dairy.\n\n\nBring the list with you when you go shopping and stick to the getting only the items on your list. Stay in the outer areas of the grocery store, such as the produce and fresh food sections. Try not to spend time in the center or middle aisles, as they are often stocked with processed and prepackaged foods. You should also avoid picking up any of the unhealthy snacks at the check-out counter.\n Make a meal plan where you account for the majority of your meals for the week. Include any snacks you will eat throughout the day and try to limit yourself to only the foods noted in your meal plan.Keep in mind it is important that your meal plan is reasonable and healthy. Rather than deprive yourself of all your favorite foods, see if you can integrate it into your meal plan in healthier ways. For example, if you love fried chicken, maybe you can include chicken in your meal plan and prepare it in healthier ways, such as baking or broiling it. This way, you can still enjoy this food without overindulging.\nAvoid skipping meals, as this can lead to more intense hunger and overeating when you do sit down to eat. Keep your meal plan consistent and have at least three meals a day at the same times every day.You should also let yourself enjoy a treat once and awhile, as cutting yourself off entirely can lead to even more feelings of guilt, shame, and anxiety. You may have on small treat once a week as a way to keep your diet healthy but also enjoyable and reasonable.\n Another way to determine if you are eating based on emotion is to do the broccoli test, where you ask yourself when you are feeling hungry, \u201cAm I so hungry I would eat broccoli right now?\u201d If the answer is yes, you are likely physically hungry. If you answer no to this question, you are likely eating emotionally.This test is one way of taking a moment to consider your craving before you act on it. You can also take a few deep breaths and acknowledge your food craving, rather than act on it right away. Try to take five minutes to consider why you are craving a certain food and whether or not you are acting on emotion instead of actual hunger.\n Make your meals an occasion and savor every bite. Start with a small portion of food on a plate of nine inches or less. Pause for one to two minutes before you begin eating to contemplate your food and show appreciation for it. Then, take small bites and chew slowly. Try to taste the food completely before you swallow it.Eating mindfully will help you avoid emotional eating because you end up focusing on the experience of the food and the act of eating it. Bringing all your senses to the table when you eat will also allow you to appreciate the flavors, textures, smells, and appearance of the food.\n Rather than cut out snacking completely, you should replace unhealthy foods in your pantry with healthy alternatives. Go for unseasoned nuts and unsalted popcorn instead of potato chips. Cut up fruits and vegetables and place them on a platter with healthy, fat-free dip. This way, when you feel a food craving coming on, you can reach for healthy snacks.You should also remove any tempting foods from your home, such as bags of chips, cookies, candy, or any processed or prepackaged foods. Taking these foods out of your space means that when you do feel a craving coming on, it is that much harder to satisfy the craving with unhealthy snacks.\n Stress reducing foods like herbals teas or fresh fruits can be a good alternative to unhealthy snacks. If you notice your emotional eating is triggered by stress, go for foods that will help you feel calm and relaxed.If you tend to get late night food cravings due to stress, you should try snacking on dark cherries. They can increase the levels of melatonin in your body, allowing you to relax and get a better sleep.\nYou can also add fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, to your diet to help you combat feelings of depression and anxiety.\n Doing physical activities like walking or running can help you to release any stress or anxiety you may be feeling. This can then help you to avoid emotional eating, as your energy will be focused on burning calories and increasing your endorphin levels. Try to do cardio activity at least once a day for 30 minutes to 1 hour, as this will help you stay healthy mentally and physically.Doing physical activity where you work up a sweat has also been shown to help with depression and insomnia, which can be triggers for emotional eating.\n Stress can be a big trigger for emotional eating. Rather than let stress overtake you and cause you to overeat, you may want to try a relaxing activity like yoga or Tai Chi. Sign up for a weekly yoga class with a friend, where you can breathe and stretch out any tension or stress you may be feeling. Doing this can help you to maintain a balanced mood and feel less of a need to reach for food as a way to stress release., Another way you can relax is to do self caring actions at home. You can also focus on self care when you feel a food craving come on, such as taking a bath, reading a book, going for a walk, or meditating. Channeling your energy into a healthy, caring act for yourself, rather than emotional eating, will likely make you feel better in the long run., If you decide to talk to a therapist or a counselor about your emotional eating, you should schedule weekly sessions where you reflect on your eating habits for the week and any coping mechanisms shown to you by the therapist. Maintaining constant communication with your therapist as you work through your food issues will allow you to feel supported and safe."}

Invest in a fan or just open a window if your room is stuffy, as sleeping in a hot room is not conducive to good sleep.\nTry to eliminate all sources of light - the window, electric lights and any blinking or LED lights on alarm clocks, televisions, or other electrical devices. If you don't want to turn them off, just cover them with a thick cloth.\nReduce noise levels as much as possible.Close your bedroom door and ask anyone still awake to keep the television/music turned down. If you find it difficult to drown out noise from the street, consider buying a white noise machine or just play some ambient music.\n Although a cup of coffee here and there can certainly help you to fight fatigue throughout the day, drinking too much or drinking it too close to bedtime can negatively impact your sleep.\n\n\nSome people don't realize the effects that caffeine has on their sleep quality and generally energy levels. To figure it out, try slowly cutting coffee and other caffeinated drinks (black tea, cola and energy drinks) from your diet over a three week period to see if you notice any increase in your energy levels.\nEven if you seem to have a high tolerance for caffeine and are not keen on the idea of giving up your morning coffee, it's a good idea to stop drinking any caffeinated drinks at least 5 hours before bedtime. Switch to decaffeinated versions instead., Although it seems like a nice idea to watch television, play a computer game or surf the net on your laptop or iPad to unwind before bed, these activities can actually do more harm than good.\n\n\nThe bright lights produced by these devices actually trick the brain into believing it's daytime, which prevents your body from producing the hormones (notably melatonin) responsible for inducing sleep.\nIn addition, watching action, thriller or horror movies/TV shows right before bed gets your heart racing, stimulating the body and brain and making sleep impossible.\nTherefore, you should make an effort to switch off all technological devices at least an hour before bed and partake in a more relaxing activity instead. Try reading a book (although not from a backlit e-reader), meditating or listening to music.\n Taking a warm bath before bed is believed to be very effective at inducing sleep, for two main reasons:\n\n\nFirstly, a hot bath helps you to relax and forget about the stresses and worries of the day - worries which are often responsible for keeping you awake at night. Secondly, the rise in body temperature (when you're in the bath) followed by the rapid drop (when you get out) mimics the body-cooling hormones your brain releases when you fall asleep.\nTake a bath for at least 20 to 30 minutes before bed, and try to ensure that the water temperature is at least 100 degree F, or as hot as you can handle without scalding yourself! Keep in mind that a hot bath is not recommended for people with diabetes, gynecologic problems, low blood pressure, heart failure, varicose veins as well as during pregnancy.\nAdd some aromatic essential oils, such as lavender or chamomile to the water, light some candles and play some soothing music for extra relaxation value!\n\n, If you're really feeling exhausted throughout the day, consider taking a short nap, as it can really work wonders for your energy levels. Keep it short and sweet through - 10 minutes to 30 minutes, max.\n\n\nIf you nap for too long, you may wake up feeling groggy and have difficulty sleeping that night. A short power nap, however, can boost energy levels and leave you feeling more awake and productive.\nAlso try following up your nap with a small cup of coffee and a quick snack for an added energy boost.\n\n"}

Getting angry, upset, or frustrated may only ruin your day and have no real effect on how that person is behaving. Rather than let your emotions get the best of you, try to take deep breaths and remain calm.You may try doing deep breathing exercises, where you close your eyes and inhale deeply in your nose from your diaphragm, followed by a deep exhale out your nose. You may do deep breathing a few times to calm down and block out the annoying person.;\n, Though you may be tempted to yell or curse at the person who is annoying you, reacting to them will only upset you and give the person the attention they may be seeking. Instead you should focus on tuning out what they are saying and try not to react to them. Coping through non-reaction can be a good way to get used to the annoying person and not them get to you.You may try repeating a word in your mind to help you not react to the person. This word may be \u201ccompassion\u201d or \u201cacceptance\u201d. Try saying the word in your mind over and over until it becomes a mantra for you to lean on.\n To help maintain your composure, it may help to try to view a situation or issue from the person\u2019s point of view. Put yourself in their shoes for a second and consider why or how they may have become so annoying. Be empathetic toward the person and show them some compassion. Doing this may help you remain calm and composed around them.For example, perhaps the person who is always pointing out the negatives of every situation did not have a very happy childhood and tends to see only the worst possible outcomes. Or maybe the family member who is often too happy and excited about everything is in fact lonely and isolated in their social life, leading them to try to always project a sense of happiness.\n When you encounter this person, you may be so frustrated that you end up saying something that hurts his or her feelings. To prevent this from happening, try to develop a few stock lines that you can use to either engage with the person or end the conversation.\n\n\n\u201dHmm, I\u2019m glad you mentioned that because\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting. I don\u2019t know the first thing about that!\u201d\n\u201cIt was nice to see you, but I have to run!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t have time to talk right now. Maybe some other time.\u201d, If you are hungry, tired, or stressed, then you might find it harder to maintain your composure around someone who annoys you. Make sure that you are practicing good self-care to increase your chances of being able to maintain your composure. Some things you can do to ensure good self-care include:\n\n\n\nGetting enough sleep.\n\nEating healthy foods.\n\nExercising regularly.\nMaking time to relax.\n If you find it difficult to be around the annoying person often, you may need to set boundaries so you do not end up getting too emotionally involved. Setting boundaries for yourself is an important coping mechanism and will ensure you are not put in situations where you might come into conflict with the person.You may try to limit the amount of time you spend with the person, such as only chatting to them briefly in the morning at work and leaving the office for lunch. Or you may only answer their calls or texts when you have free time rather than answering them right away.\nYou may also try to remain calm and detached when they speak to in meetings or social situations where you cannot excuse yourself. Doing this can set up personal boundaries for you to help you cope with the person\u2019s irritating nature.\nFor example, if the annoying person starts talking too loudly at a family dinner, you may try to stay detached and focus on something else in your mind. This will allow you to block out the person and stay calm.\n You should also focus on the positive when you are around the person and try not to let their mood dampen yours. Being positive and proactive, rather than angry and reactive may discourage the person from trying to annoy you or bother you.One way you can appear positive is by maintaining open body language. This means maintaining eye contact with the person and nodding to show them you are not fazed by them. You should also keep your arms relaxed and by your sides.\nAvoid responding to the person with a passive aggressive comment or a snide remark. Instead, say something simple and polite like, \u201cThank you for sharing that with me\u201d or \u201cSounds great.\u201d\n\n, If you are unable to handle being around the annoying person, despite trying to remain positive, you may want to avoid being around the person. Keep your distance and look for ways to avoid spending time with the person. Sometimes the best way to cope is to separate yourself from the person and take some time away from them.You may try to keep your distance for a set period of time so that you have some space away from the person. Maybe you skip a family get together to take a small break from hanging out with the person. Or maybe you try to choose assignments at work that do not involve the person so you can have some space away from them.\n You may end up having to confront the annoying person and try to work together on ways to address any issues you are having with them. Before you confront the person, you should sit down and try to identify what annoys you so much about the person. You may ask yourself, \u201cWhat does the person do that annoys me so much?\u201d or \u201cWhat is it about this person that I find irritating?\u201d You may then able to address the issue once you are aware of what it is.For example, you may be annoyed by the fact that your co-worker always comes into meetings late and appears disorganized in front of clients. You may then realize that you are annoyed by her behavior overall and how unprofessional she is acting.\nAnother example might be that you are annoyed with how your family member always talks about themselves and ignores the problems of others. You may realize that you are annoyed by him because he is not considerate of others.\n If you would like to confront the person, you should do so one on one in a private, quiet area. You may ask the person if you can speak to them privately after work or call them and ask to talk to them in private. Try to speak to them in person, if possible.\n\n\nAlways use \u201cI\u201d statements and avoid placing blame or accusing the person. For example, \"I feel\" or \"I think.\" You may start the discussion by saying, \u201cListen, I need to let you know that I am feeling annoyed at your behavior.\u201d\nYou may then expand your thoughts and be honest about why you are annoyed by the person. You may say, \u201cI feel as though your tardiness to meetings and your disorganization is reflecting badly on our team and the company as a whole. I am concerned that you are coming across as unprofessional to clients.\u201d\nOr, you may say to your family member, \"I feel as though you are not being considerate of others and are only focusing on your needs. I am concerned that you are not being as aware of others and their issues as you could be.\"\n\n, You should try to work with the person to come up with possible solutions or adjustments they can make to their behavior. It may be difficult for the person to hear your feedback but they may end feeling bad about their behavior and be willing to try to adjust or change.You should ask them directly, \u201cWhat can I do to support you better?\u201d or \u201cHow can I help you improve?\u201d Show them you want to collaborate and work together to address the issue.\n It may be hard for the person to hear your feedback and they may end up getting upset or angry at you when you confront them. You should be prepared for the conversation to get a little heated. You may want to reach out to a superior at work, such as a Human Resources representative, a close friend or another family member, and ask them to support you if the conversation gets too intense.You should try to enlist support leading up to the conversation with the person who annoys you as well, as your co-workers or friends may be able to give you suggestions on how to address the issue.\nMake sure you do not gossip or trash talk to person with people in their workspace, their friend group or in your family, as this could just make the problem worse. Instead, try to talk about them respectfully with others and solicit advice on how to best handle the situation.\n\n"}

Raise any concerns you have with their medical professional. If your parent minimizes their alcoholism or tries to talk around it, speak up and make sure your parent has adequate information about how alcohol may affect their health.Ask the medical doctor, \u201cAre there any guidelines you would suggest for alcohol consumption? How might these medications interact with alcohol?\u201d\n\n, Quitting alcohol cold turkey can cause severe or even deadly withdrawal symptoms.Talk to your parent\u2019s doctor or other medical professionals about creating a healthy and effective way to reduce or eliminate your parent\u2019s alcohol consumption.\n\nYour parent\u2019s doctor may prescribe a medication to help your parent reduce their alcohol consumption, or they may refer your parent to an addiction specialist or mental health specialist.\nA psychologist or other mental health specialist may be able to help address any underlying psychological issues that might be contributing to your parent\u2019s drinking.\n If your parent is in assisted living or you are planning to look into assisted living, check their alcohol policies.

Carefully consider the options before making a choice.If you\u2019re about to admit a parent to assisted living, let staff and physicians know ahead of time of your parent\u2019s alcoholism.\n While you may think you are helping your parent, it\u2019s likely they will go buy more. This can lead to anger, resentment, bitterness, fights, or large disagreements, especially if your parent is under the influence when you do it.

Offer a ride, find a taxi, or plan to meet at their place. If you know your parent is resistant to get help, keep them safe in the meantime. If you know your parent is likely to drink, make arrangements ahead of time.If hosting a family get-together, host it at your house and do not serve alcohol.\n Offer to help your parent get the support and assistance they need to stop drinking. If they keep refusing to get help, arrange for an intervention.Consult an addiction specialist before arranging the intervention.

The Motorcycle Safety Foundation has a checklist for this purpose called T-CLOCS. T-CLOCS stands for: T - Tires, wheels. C - Controls (levers and pedal, cables, hoses, throttle). L - Lights (battery, headlamp, brake lamp, turn signals, mirrors, etc.). O - Oil (fluid levels and leaks). C - Chassis (frame, suspension, chain or belt, fasteners). S - Stands (center stand and side stand)Download a pdf copy of the checklist here.\n;\n, Familiarize yourself with your motorcycle\u2019s components and how it will perform on streets and highways. Typical motorcycle components and controls include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight side handlebar accelerator control\nRight side handlebar brake control\nLeft side handlebar clutch\nFoot-pedal gear shifter\nSpeed and fuel gauges\n\n, For United States residents, this can be obtained at your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office or through its official website. Familiarize yourself with all the laws, requirements, and motorcycle rider\u2019s rights specific to the state or jurisdiction you reside. This may include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial insurance conditions for motorcyclists.\nRules pertaining to passengers.\nSpeed limits and restrictions.\nWhether or not your state allows motorcycles to use express lanes.\nRestrictions for noise, including requirements for certain mufflers and baffles.\n Most countries and jurisdictions require that you obtain a motorcycle permit. Once you have done all the required reading you should be ready to attempt the written test. If successful, you will receive a temporary motorcycle license or learner's permit. You are now ready to learn how to ride. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Before you get too excited and turn your bike on, make sure that you have someone knowledgeable present. Hiring a professional or attending training class can be helpful at this point.\n The first time throwing a leg over your bike may feel awkward. Try following these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance yourself by leaning carefully against the tank and placing both hands on the hand grips.\nIf starting from the left side, place all of your weight onto your left leg. Never mount from the opposite side of the kickstand. If your bike has a center stand, mount from whichever side is most comfortable.\nLift your right leg high up and over the bike. Lifting your leg high will ensure your leg does not get caught before reaching the other side of the bike. Never mount from behind. , Now that you have mounted your bike, take the time to familiarize yourself with the weight and feel of it. Make any needed mirror adjustments and get acquainted with your individual bike\u2019s foot pegs, turn signals, horn, and lights.\n Whether you decide on a professional or an experienced friend, they should be able to walk you through these basic skills: how to start, accelerate, decelerate, shift, brake, stop, park, and start again. Successfully learning these skills requires that you know how the controls of your bike function.\n Your right foot controls the rear brake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwisting the right hand grip towards your body will apply throttle (gas/acceleration). Be gentle with the throttle. An excessive rev can be dangerous and lead to an unintentional wheelie.\nPulling the right hand lever will apply the front brakes. Like the throttle, gentleness is key. The two-fingered technique will work for most bikes while some will require the use of your entire hand.\nThe rear brake is mostly useful for situations with reduced traction or when operating at a low speed. Bikes that carry more weight over the rear wheel, such as cruisers, may find breaking with the rear more effective. , Like the right hand lever, the two-fingered technique will work for some bikes while others will need the entire hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clutch controls the connection between the engine and transmission. Squeezing the clutch lever disengages the clutch and disconnects the engine from the transmission. Releasing will engage the clutch and connect them. When disengaging the clutch you effectively place the bike in neutral regardless of whether it is in gear or not. Engaging the clutch will place the bike into whichever gear is currently selected.\nJust as you would with the brake and throttle the clutch lever should be squeezed and released as smoothly as possible.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost motorcycles will follow the \u201c1 down, 5 up\u201d shift pattern: 6th gear (if applicable), 5th gear, 4th gear, 3rd gear, 2nd gear, NEUTRAL, 1st gear.\nIt will take time to get used to so practice finding neutral with your left foot. Look for the green \"N\" to show on the gauges as you move the Lever up or down.\nYou must shift gears in this order: Disengage clutch (using left hand). Shift gears (using left foot). Engage clutch.\nGradually applying the throttle while engaging the clutch will make shifting gears smoother., Follow these steps to turn your motorcycle on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, flip the kill switch to the \"on\" position (your kill switch will likely be a red rocker switch near the right hand grip).\nNext, turn your key to the \"ignition\" position. At this point most bikes will perform a self-check.\nMake sure that the bike is in neutral. The green \"N\" should be lit on your gauges.\nDisengage the clutch. Some bikes will require this to start the engine.\nPush the start button (this will likely be marked with a logo of a circular arrow surrounding a lightning bolt and be located to the bottom of the kill switch). If everything is in working order, your engine should begin to run. Some bikes may need a gentle application of throttle to get the engine going.\nBe patient as the engine warms up. Once the engine turns over, it may take 45 seconds to several minutes until your bike is ready to go. Unlike a car, ensuring the engine of your bike is properly warmed up is a crucial step for safe riding. , Forgetting to do so can be dangerous. Centerstands require a forward rocking motion to retract. Once your kickstand or centerstand is up you\u2019ll find yourself on your toes and ready to ride.\n Just as before, make sure to have an experienced rider nearby to supervise you.\n Remember, to do this you must:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSqueeze the clutch lever to disengage the clutch.\nMove the shifter down to first gear using your foot.\nRelease the clutch slowly.\nTwist the throttle to keep the engine from stalling.\nYou will feel your bike begin to move forward. Put both feet up onto the foot pegs once you have gained momentum. Congratulations! You are now riding a motorcycle! Before you ride off into the sunset you may want to test the brakes first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile moving at a speed roughly above 10\u00a0mph (16\u00a0km/h), push the hand grip on the side you wish to turn towards. If you wish to turn right, lean slightly to the right while pushing the right handgrip away from your body.\n Once you have built confidence at lower speeds, you may wish to practice shifting into the higher gears. As with everything else, the idea is to be as smooth as possible, whether it is your clutch, throttle or brake. Achieving this fluidity will take practice and muscle memory.\n Recall all of the laws and proper practices for safe riding you learned in order to receive your permit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

When there is less moisture the chicken will bake better. If there is too much moisture on the chicken, it may steam rather than bake., You could also put in a lemon wedge, an apple, or herbs.

It becomes even more important after middle age as your body starts to slow down a bit. Aim to get in about 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.Find an exercise you love. If running isn't your thing, try yoga or swimming. Don't be afraid to branch out, especially as your body may rule out certain exercises over time.\nAdd more activity to your everyday life. You don't need to set aside a special time to go to the gym. Rather, you can just add more activity throughout your day. Take a walk at lunch. Swing around the office a few times when you go the bathroom. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park farther out at the store.\nAll these bits of activity add up. In fact, you can break up your 30 minutes of activity as you see fit. You can have three sets of 10 minutes or even six sets of 5 minutes.\n As you age, your metabolism starts slowing down and you're at a higher risk of heart disease. Sticking to a healthy diet can help with both of these things, as it can keep your heart healthier and lower your caloric intake for your slower metabolism.Make your proteins lean, such as chicken, fish, beans, and lentils.\nEat whole grains instead of refined grains. Eat oatmeal, whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, quinoa, barley, and other whole grains as your carbohydrates.\nEat your fruits and vegetables. Make sure you are \"eating the rainbow\" as often as possible, meaning you incorporate a variety of fruits and vegetables.\nSkip foods that are high in saturated fat and sodium.\n Getting enough sleep is just as important after middle age as it was when you were younger. While not everyone needs the same amount of sleep, you should aim for about 7 to 8 hours every night. Getting enough sleep keeps you healthier overall, but it also helps you feel better rested and happier.Try setting up a sleeping routine, going to bed and getting up at the same time every day. Start going to bed an hour before you need to go to sleep. It's important to turn off electronic devices at this time, as those can affect your sleep. If you have trouble remembering when to go to bed, set an alarm to remind you to start getting ready for sleep.\nBlock out as much light as possible. If you get light from outside when you're sleeping, try block out curtains to make your room dark. You sleep better when you block out the light.\nUse white noise or ear plugs to block out any noise.\nTalk to your doctor if you're having trouble sleeping. You may need to get a sleep study done to find out if have a sleeping disorder.\n If you want to stay healthy as you get older, you should skip smoking. Smoking can lead to a variety of health problems, from lung cancer to heart disease, just to name a few. Plus, it increases your blood pressure. If you're looking for a reason to quit, make maintaining your health one of those reasons.To help yourself quit, list all the reasons for quitting, such as your health, staying alive for your family, and your finances.Ask for support from your friends and family. They can offer support as you try to quit.\nYou can also try assistance such as a patch or gum. They can help wean you off of nicotine.\n As you get older, your muscles and bones start to wear down a bit. One thing you can do to help is to take supplements of both vitamin D and calcium, which can help with bone health. You should be getting 1,000-1,200 milligrams of calcium each day, either from food or a supplement, and 600-800 international units of vitamin D each day, depending on your age. Talk to your doctor about whether a supplement is a good idea for you.It can also help to make sure you don't drink too much. Generally, keep it to one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men.\n Your brain can start to decline after middle age as well, if you don't do things to keep it sharp. One step you can do is to work mental puzzles, such as crosswords or sudoku puzzles. You can also do things like change up your driving routine. Learning a new skill, such as how to throw a clay pot or how to play the violin, can also help, as learning new things keeps your brain sharp., Another way to keep up your health is to make sure you schedule regular checkups. Your doctor can keep an eye on things like your blood work, as well as things like your eyes and ears and overall health. A doctor can catch things that maybe you've missed, particularly if it's something that shows up in your blood work.If you're having trouble sleeping, you could say, \"I get 8 hours of sleep of night, but I still wake up feeling exhausted. Do you think you could help me figure out what's wrong?\"\nYou could also say, \"As I'm getting a bit older, is there anything I can do to keep my energy and health?\"\n\n"}

A neutral place is best. Don\u2019t have one friend come to the other friend\u2019s house. Look for a quiet spot outside or a have your friends meet you at a caf\u00e9.\n\n\nMake sure that your intentions for having them meet you are clear. Try saying something like, \u201cI have heard both sides of the story. I think that if the two of you sat down and shared your feelings, then you could put this fight behind you. I will go along and mediate if you need me to.\u201d\n\n, If your friends are still emotionally charged from the argument, then it might not be possible to resolve the conflict. Encourage both of your friends to arrive in a good state of mind.For example, you could encourage your friends to listen to their favorite \u201chappy song\u201d before arriving at the meeting, or ask each of them to take five minutes to breathe deeply and collect their thoughts.\n Using \u201cI\u201d statements can help when two people are fighting because it reduces the chances that your friends will become defensive. \u201cYou\u201d statements make people feel defensive.For example, if one friend says \u201cYou make me feel bad about myself!\u201d then the other friend might feel the need to defend herself from this statement. This can start a cycle of blaming and defending that will go nowhere.\nInstead, your friend could say something like, \u201cI feel bad when you criticize what I am wearing.\u201d This statement places the emphasis on how the speaker feels while still pointing out the other person\u2019s behavior.\nTalk to your friends about why it is important to use \u201cI\u201d statements during their discussion and encourage them to do so. If you notice one of your friend using \u201cYou\u201d statements, then gently correct him or her. Say something like, \u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d\n\n, If your friends start fighting right in front of you, it is important to defuse the situation. Do not allow it to continue. For example, if your friends start raising their voices at each other, then call a time out or suggest that you take a 15 minute break to cool off.If your friends cannot sit down and discuss the problem without arguing, then you may need to ask an adult to help mediate the conflict. Try asking a teacher or parent if he or she would be willing to mediate.\n Encourage your friends to ask each other questions during this conversation as well. It might be possible that the fight was caused by misinformation or a misunderstanding, so asking questions can be helpful.\n\n\nFor example, if one friend thinks the other friend intentionally left her out of something, but the other friend thought she already had plans, then that information is crucial.\nIf you are aware of any misunderstandings, then you could gently encourage one friend to ask the other friend about it. Try saying something like, \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to ask Susie why she did not invite you to the movies last weekend?\u201d\n\n, After both friends have talked for a while and shared their feelings and perspectives, they may be willing to apologize and forgive each other. However, don\u2019t try to force this. If your friends feel ready to forgive, then they will probably do so.\n\n\nTry saying something like, \u201cDo you both feel better now that you have talked?\u201d\nIf your friends are still upset with each other and are not ready to forgive and move on, then let them go their separate ways. Depending on what has happened between them, they might just need some time apart.\n To help your friends get along better in the future, it might also be helpful to look for a solution that might prevent a similar problem and discuss ways that your friends can put it into practice.This can come in the form of a new rule in the friendship or a pledge to do or not do something.\n\n\nFor example, if one friend was upset because the other friend did not invite him to go to the movies over the weekend, then the other friend might agree to send him a text even if she thinks he is busy.\n\n"}

These photos are wonderful images for the family albums, but in order to sell photos online or in other venues, the photos must be excellent quality and saleable to the publishers, designers and editors who buy photos.\n\n\nResearch the types of photos that are currently selling online. With the results of this research in mind, review existing photos and plan trips to capture images that are currently in demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, A photographer who is computer savvy will find programs or instructions to create a website that will display the available photos and the tools to collect fees from the buyers. Photographers who are not confident enough to create their own presence on the web can hire experts to create a website.\n Follow the procedures for submitting photos to these agencies and present your photos to the selection boards. Established agencies are recognized by the individuals currently buying photographs so your photos will find an excellent showcase if accepted by a stock agency. The stock agency acts as an intermediary for photographers. The personnel at the agency work with the customers so the photographers concentrate on the business of acquiring new photos.\n\n\nTake new photos to meet the standards of the stock photo agencies if your first submissions are rejected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRely on the stock agency to negotiate the rights that each photographer sells to customers. The expertise of staff at the stock agencies will facilitate the appropriate placement of photos with the buyers. Photographers do not want to relinquish rights to their photos without obtaining proper compensation for the right to use or publish their photos.\n These agencies accept photographs from an amateur photographer and provide a great entryway to a more sophisticated career. Although some microstock agencies charge a regular fee to participate, there are excellent microstock agencies that provide their services for free.\n\n\nStart with a microstock agency to gain experience and expertise. Look for an agency that provides excellent guidance for photographers with limited skills.\n Practice and experience will pay off in better photographs. Develop both the art and craft of your photographic expertise.\n\n"}

There are also a variety of different formats you can use from individualized designs to photo cards.\n\n\nYou can get a sense of the different card formats from online services by looking at different websites such as Shutterfly, PSPrint., Once you\u2019ve had a chance to see the different options of card formats and services available online, decide which one best suits your wishes and needs.\n\n\nMost online services, including Shutterfly and PSPrint, will allow you to customize your messages and designs from a simple template as you like.\nMake sure to check the prices for the cards. The more elaborate your card, the more expensive it\u2019s going to be. Generally, the more cards you buy, the cheaper your order will be.\n After looking at the different motif options for the front of your card, choose one and enter it into the online interface.\n\n\nWrite a message on the card if there isn\u2019t one. You may also have the option to include an additional message to anything that may already appear as a part of your design.\nIf you are making a photo card on a service like Shutterfly, you\u2019ll likely only have one side to your card. If this is the case, add your message to the front. Remember not to put too much on a one-sided card, though., You might want to include additional decorative motifs or a personalized message inside of each card.\n\n\nIf there is a pre-formulated message inside the card, you may have the option to rewrite it as you like.\n Before you place your order, check each aspect of the card to make sure there aren\u2019t any mistakes. If there are, fix them and then check until the card is exactly how you like it.\n\n\nAlso check to make sure your designs and messages match one another. You wouldn\u2019t want a blue and silver traditional front design with a green and red modern inside motif.\n Once you\u2019ve designed and personalized your Christmas card, place your order with the online service.\n\n\nPrint out the confirmation in case there is a problem with your shipment or with the design.\nWhen the cards arrive, also check them for any mistakes from your original order.\n\n"}

Write a list of the goal or goals you want to win at. Make them as detailed as possible. Break large, vague goals down into achievable parts. For example, if your goal is to \"win at life,\" break that down into smaller goals, such as \"get a job I love\" \"finish my education\" \"build meaningful relationships\" \"feel good about myself.\";\n, First, break each goal into smaller ones. Breaking your goals down allows you to track your progress. For instance, the goal \"feel good about myself\" could be broken down into sub-goals such as \"build a positive self-image\" \"exercise\" \"be well rested\" and \"work through negative feelings.\"Break those goals down again into actionable steps. For instance, \"be well rested\" can be broken down into \"1. Start winding down at 8:30.\" \"2. Be ready for bed by 10 every night.\" \"3. Wake up at 7:30am and get immediately out of bed.\"\nIdentify the steps that are most difficult. For instance, it may be easy for you to wind down and get into bed at the same time every night, but difficult to pop right out of bed in the morning.Identifying the challenging steps allows you to practice and revise. If getting out of bed immediately is difficult, add helpful steps, such as setting your clothes out beside your bed the night before.\n Get organized and create an achievement schedule for yourself. Have daily goals, weekly goals, monthly goals, and yearly goals. Check in regularly to make sure you are achieving them all. If you don't achieve all your goals one week, try again the next.\n Make sure your goals are actually achievable. You can't win at an impossible game. If a goal can be broken down into actionable steps, it is probably realistic. Make sure your time frame is also realistic. Can everything you want to achieve be achieved in the time you envision? Check your progress as you go, and revise your schedule until the pace of improvement is reasonable.\n\n\nTry introducing one or two changes to your schedule at a time. If you try to change everything in your life at once, you may overwhelm yourself and end up reverting to old habits.\nTalk to people you trust about your goals, especially if you're worried they may not be reasonable., Take a few minutes to imagine yourself winning at your goal. Imagine every detail of perfect success: how it feels, what it looks like, how everyone will react. Then turn it around entirely. Imagine each and ever possible roadblock you might come up against.Take several minutes to think of anything that might get in your way. Don't solve the problem, just imagine any scenario that might lead to disaster.\nMental contrasting has been shown to be more helpful than pure positivity. Thinking too positively can lead you to relax too soon, and thinking only of the possible downfalls can lead you to sabotage your own project."}

You should also describe why it was important to make this change (if it's a bug fix, it should be self-explanatory, but if you're refactoring something, you should state why)\n\n\nGood example: Created a new VideoProcessor class to handle processing for uploaded videos and separate the background processes from the user interface component (formerly Video class, now EmbeddedVideo).\nBad example: Made some new classes and renamed the video class\n\n, Testing your code thoroughly is important before deploying it.

If there are limitations of the feature or fix, though, state them.

Things like this are really minor and shouldn't affect functionality at all.

Try them out the month before you go to make sure you are comfortable with the process.Conserving space is especially important if you tend to bleed heavily. In addition to painkillers, pads, tampons, or menstrual cups, you might want to see if you can squeeze in a heating pad, vitamin B6, calcium, and magnesium, and iron supplements if you are anemic."}

{"title": "How to Help a Friend Who Has Been Raped3", "summary": "let them be in control.\nfocus on it as much as they want to.\ntake care of yourself.\nbe patient.", "article": " Experiencing a sexual assault or rape is a huge loss of control, and your friend needs to be able to feel in control while they are healing.Try not to make decisions for them or take charge, but rather allow them to do it for themselves.Encourage them and then support them with whatever they decide.\n\n\nIf the rape did not occur recently, there may still be some situations or things that your friend feels very particular about. It will help their anxiety and sense of self for you to let them control certain aspects of their environment to make sure they are comfortable.\nLet them control who knows. Your friend confided in you because they trust you, respect that trust and allow them to control who they tell.\nLet them control what you guys do when you are hanging out together, especially where you go. It is the one way to ensure they are going to be comfortable.\nLet them decide when they are ready to participate in activities, everything from social activities to support groups or counseling.\n It is a horrible thing to happen to someone, and they are going to need you for support. One way you can help support them is to make sure they are taking a mental break from it every once and awhile, if they can. Remind them that you are there to listen, but mention that maybe you can help distract them for a little bit. Afterwards, remind them that you are still available to talk if they want to. Talk to them about it as often as you can and as often as they need.\n\n\nFor a short distraction, maybe offer to play a card game, watch a movie, or go get coffee or ice cream, if they are comfortable with it.\n In all of the worrying and helping your friend, don't forget about your own health. Hearing about a rape can be very upsetting. Being around someone who is going through a healing process from a traumatic event, can have a profound affect on you as well. Know that you need to take care of yourself so that you are able to help your friend. Try the following:\n\n\nMake sure you are eating and sleeping well. You will need to recharge your batteries in order to keep up with your life and with helping your friend.\nMake sure you are taking breaks for yourself. Hopefully your friend has others supporting them, so that you all can share in the tasks and take breaks when you need to.\nIf you are feeling emotional, start to notice you are having nightmares, or seem to be having similar symptoms to your friend, seek help from a counselor. You may be experiencing vicarious trauma.\n Recovery from any traumatic experience takes time and can take many years.In this instance your friend went through something very violating. It may take time for them to trust, to be okay with going out, or to \u201creturn to normal\u201d again. Give them the space and time they need to rebuild their sense of safety, control and self-worth.If the rape occurred long ago, understand that there are aspects that your friend may still be dealing with. Either way, they will be so grateful to have a friend like you supporting them.\n\n"}
{"title": "How to Make Hair Extensions2", "summary": "get the right materials.\nmeasure and cut the hair.\nlayer two or three wefts on top of each other.\nsew the extension clips to the hair.\napply the hair extensions correctly.", "article": " To make these clip-in extensions, you will need one full pack of hair wefts (human or synthetic), a pair of scissors, a needle and thread (in a color that resembles the color of the hair), a pack of extension clips (available in most beauty supply stores) and a tube of bonding glue.\n Take the hair weft and measure it against your head. You want it to stretch from just behind one ear to just behind the other, in a U-shaped pattern. Use your scissors to cut the hair weft to the correct width.\n Usually, a single layer of hair weft is not enough for people with normal to thick hair.\n\n\nIf you are using the extensions to make your hair look longer two layers will probably be enough, but if you want to make your hair look thicker you will need three layers.\nAs a result your will need to measure and cut one or two more hair wefts, identical to the first one. There will be enough hair in a single pack of hair wefts to do this.\nYou can either sew the layers together along the weft lines (by hand or using a sewing machine) or you can stick them together using bonding glue.\nIf you decide to use bonding glue (which is probably the easier option of you're not an experienced sewer), run a thick line of bonding glue just beneath the weft line on the first piece of hair, then stick the second piece on top, ridge side up.\nDo the same with the third layer of hair (if using), then wait for the bonding glue to dry completely.\n Next, take your needle and thread and sew the extension clips to the weft line.\n\n\nIn terms of placement, you'll need to put one clip on either side of the extensions, right at the edge, and one in the middle to prevent the extensions from sagging.\nMake sure to sew the clips to the side of the extensions with the rubber ridges and make sure to sew the extension clips with the comb side up -- otherwise you won't be able to put them in your hair!You don't need to use any fancy sewing techniques; just thread your needle (tying a knot at the end) and pass it through the first small hole on the extension clip and through the ridge of the hair weft.\nBring the needle and thread up over the top of the extensions and pass it through the second small hole. Continue in this manner until you reach the last hole on the clip. Pass the needle and thread through, then tie several small knots in the thread to secure before cutting off the rest.\n Now that you have your very own hair extensions, it's important to know how to apply them correctly.\n\n\nPin up all of the hair above your ears. Take a comb and tease (or backcomb) the hair at the roots, then spritz it with hairspray. This will give the extension clips something to hold onto.\nOpen the clips on your hair extensions and fasten them onto the exposed roots -- one behind each ear and one in the middle.If you decided to make a second set of extensions for added thickness, let down an extra inch of hair and repeat the process of teasing and hair spraying before applying the second set.\nLet down the the top section of hair and brush or comb to combine your natural hair with the extensions. If your extensions are made from human hair, you can now style your hair as normal using a flat iron or curling tongs.\n\n"}

{"title": "How to Stop Squinting2", "summary": "adjust the light of the room.\nwear sunglasses.\nwear a hat or visor.\nuse eye black.", "article": " A lot of the time squinting is caused by the amount of light we are taking in. If you are able, adjust the brightness settings of available light sources. For example, change the type of bulb in your office or home to a lower wattage.\n\n\nIt may be difficult to change the lighting in your office so it is best to consult your immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department before attempting to make any changes yourself.\nIf you are squinting when reading an electronic device, check the settings if it is possible to adjust the brightness settings. For example, televisions and mobile phones can easily be adjusted within the settings menu.\n The most common reason for squinting is due to the brightness of the sunshine. If you are squinting outside on a bright sunny day, a pair of quality sunglasses may solve or reduce the problem. Research what brands offer as some brands focus on fashion while others on function.\n\n\nMake sure the glasses block at least 99% of ultraviolet (UV) rays.\nBudget how much you are willing to spend on sunglasses as some can reach upwards of $500. If you are liable to lose them, think about choosing a pair of sunglasses that fit within your means.\nIf you are more active, choose a pair of sunglasses that won\u2019t fly off your face easily. You can also purchase accessories to keep them in place or to turn your everyday glasses into sunglasses by simply clipping onto the frame.\n The brim of a hat or visor provides temporary shade by cutting the amount of light entering into your eyes. Choose a hat or visor that\u2019s comfortable and suits your style. A baggy hat may fly off when windy; in contrast, a hat that is too small may cut off circulation and cause you discomfort.\n\n\nMany hats can be adjusted or come in different sizes. Make sure you choose one right for your head shape.\nSome athletic hats are made of breathable material that wicks sweat away from the body, which may be a wise choice for humid climates or if you are prone to sweating a lot.\n Many individuals who play sports outdoors or under bright stadium lights use eye black to reduce glare. Apply black strips or black grease underneath each eye to help reduce squinting. Be careful when using grease and make sure not to let it stain clothes or furniture as it may be hard to clean.Football players and baseball players famously apply this under their eyes so watch a game or research pictures for the correct way to apply eye black.\n\n"}

Most professional football players have been playing the game since at least high school.If you're not in high school anymore, but you still want to play football, join a local league, or find camps. Do anything to boost your skills and knowledge of the game.;\n, In high school, you should expect to invest about 10-15 hours a week practicing. In college, that time increases to about 25-30 hours a week.To go pro you have to play football as much as possible. In the off-season, don't stop training.Expect to make some sacrifices to get in all the training you need. Becoming a professional athlete requires a huge time commitment., If you want to get into the pros, your best bet is to get into a good college. Pay attention to your GPA and take classes that will boost your chances of getting into a good school.Take classes in biology and the health sciences. The more you know about the human body and what is required for peak performance, the better.Keep in mind playing college football is not a guarantee that you will play professionally. Only 1.7% of college players will play professional football., If a scout visits your school, be on your best behavior. Don't show-off, and don't disrespect your teammates. Scouts are looking to see how well you play the game, but also how well you play with others.Maintain a good relationship with your coach. Your coach might know the scouts and be able to give you a reference. Getting a recommendation from a coach could be the defining factor in whether you get picked up or not.No matter what, keep a good attitude. Show energy in warm-up and stay positive on the sidelines. If you get negative feedback from a scout, learn from it. Improve yourself daily., Include your basic information, the position you play, and any accomplishments as a player. As with any resume, list anything relevant to your goals.If you worked at a football camp, or helped coach a little league team, include it in your resume. Include anything that might set you apart from the competition. Your goal is to make professional football your job, so build a resume to reflect that., Find any articles that mention you or your team, even if it's the local paper from your high school days. Find video footage of your team playing and look for plays where you excel.Have a friend or family member record you during your games to help you build a highlight reel. , Send your press kit to teams you want to play for. Don't forget to follow up with the places you submit. Call or send an e-mail to let them know you're eager to play for them.Be sure to thank any of the teams that pass you up. Let them know you appreciate their time and consideration.\nIf you don't get picked up by any teams, don't give up. Find other leagues to join so you can keep gaining experience. Keep your resume and press kit updated and don't stop submitting., An agent can act as a link between you and the teams you may want to play for. Finding an agent to represent you could be the ticket to getting signed by the NFL.There are certain rules and regulations that agents must follow in regards to representing college players. Agents typically have to wait until the end of a player's college career before actively recruiting them., Knowing how to play football is only part of the process. Professional athletes are in top physical condition. Expect to make working out a priority.\n\n\nFind the physical statistics of a few professional athletes and work hard to match them. Look into the workouts they do and make those exercises part of your routine., Perform exercises such as the bench press and the deadlift. Workout with the heaviest amount of weight you can lift correctly for 5 repetitions.Work the large muscle groups such as the chest, back, quadriceps, and hamstrings., Practice sprinting at increasing intervals. Start with trying to complete two 150-meter sprints in under 20 seconds. Rest for 30 seconds between each sprint.As you build up endurance, increase the length and intensity of the sprints. Try doing three 200-meter sprints in under 30 seconds. Rest for 30 seconds between each run.Make sure you give your body time to recover after each sprint. Rest for 3-5 minutes between each series of sprints.Work on boosting your heart rate and keeping it high for a short amount of time. Playing football requires explosive energy in short busts. Find workouts that mimic that intensity., Training like a professional athlete means eating like one. Since you'll be doing a lot of heavy lifting, make sure you get enough protein. A good guideline is to make protein account for about 1/3 of your plate at each meal.Eat lean proteins such as chicken, fish, and beans. Try to mix in a vegetarian meal once or twice a week. Soy is one of the healthier options for a vegetarian lean protein.Your position will depend on the amount of calories you need to eat. If you need to be light on your feet, aim for 3,000-5,000 calories during training. If you're a lineman, you may end up needing 8,000 calories."}

How invasive is it?\nWhat's the typical recovery time?\nIs it common for patients to be in pain after the surgery? If so, what is the best treatment option for the pain?\nWill your child need to be temporarily admitted to the hospital?\nWhat are the procedures for you and your child before, during, and after the surgery?\nWhat are some things that you'll need to bring with you to the hospital (insurance information, emergency contact numbers, etc.)?;\n, No two children are alike, regardless of whether or not they're autistic, and you'll need to make sure that the doctor is aware of any potential medical afflictions that could cause complications with your child's surgery. Even if your child has no other health issues except for the one resulting in the surgery, you may need to tell the doctor about things like your child's contact lenses or any past surgeries or medical treatments. Oftentimes, you'll fill out a form detailing your child's medical history, but ask the doctor if there's anything else they need to know.\n\n\nMention any health issues or requirements to their doctor. For example, if your child is prone to seizures, has any allergies, or has a medical condition such as diabetes, the doctor will need to know.\nBring up pre- and post-surgery needs, too - for example, medications your child may need to take in the morning, or if their diet should change after the surgery.\nIf your child is on any existing medications and will need to go on a new one after the surgery, work with the doctor to find a medication that won't potentially conflict with your child's existing medications.\n Autistic people may struggle with the change in environment or certain factors of the environment in the hospital, and the doctors and nurses want to help accommodate them and make them more comfortable. Ask about accommodations that your child could be given before and after their surgery, and during a hospital stay. A few examples of these accommodations are:Can your child be sedated before administering an IV?\nIs it possible to remove unnecessary equipment from the pre-operative room to prevent high anxiety?\nCould the doctors and nurses remove laboratory coats before entering the child's room?\nWould it be possible for very few people to come in at a time, to avoid scaring your child with the amount of doctors or nurses?\nIf your child can reliably communicate, can your child speak or use AAC instead of you communicating for them? If they use AAC, what kind of AAC can they use?\nCould your child be in a post-operative room that does not have harsh, flickering, or buzzing lights? Can the lights in the room be dimmed, as an alternative?\nCan the nurses make sure you're in the room when your child wakes up?\nCould you and your child tour the hospital so that your child can be more familiar with the setting?Discuss comfort objects with the doctor as well. For example, you could say something like, \"My child is autistic and needs to carry a stuffed fox to keep calm. Can we make sure that she has her fox when she falls asleep and when she wakes up?\"\n\n, Autistic people can have an unusual recovery time compared to neurotypical people,and even if your child recovers at the typical pace, they'll still need time to rest and recover. Do everything possible to avoid scheduling the surgery on a week that's busy for either you or your child, whether it's because of their school, your work, their therapy, or any outside activities that may potentially conflict with the surgery or the recovery period.\n\n\nThere are four types of surgery - major surgery (such as to correct issues caused by birth defects), minor surgery (such as correcting a bone fracture), elective surgery (when you schedule the surgery beforehand), and emergency surgery (such as for a potentially fatal heart defect).Depending on the type of surgery, your scheduling options may be limited, or you may not be able to schedule it yourself.\nIf the child's surgery can't wait until there's a break from school, then you will need to discuss your child's surgery with their teacher and school attendance.\nIf you absolutely can't avoid scheduling their surgery when everyone is busy, then cancel any non-important events that you can, move your child's therapy appointments, arrange to pick up their schoolwork, and make sure that there's always an adult able to care for your child. Your child's recovery is more important than their speech therapy.\n Even if your child is nonverbal and never appears to be paying attention to you, they can still listen and understand what you're saying, and it's important that they know what's going on. While it's recommended to talk to toddlers and preschoolers early due to their limited concept of time, and to older children as soon as possible so that they have advance warning, consider your child's memory and skills at changing their routine when it comes to talking to them about the surgery.\n\n\nTry using social stories, a picture schedule of what will happen at the hospital, or reading age-appropriate books with your child about surgery, and exposing your child to the sort of equipment they may see while at the hospital with toy medical kits.The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has a slideshow for autistic children that explains what happens at the hospital, which can be accessed here.\n\n\nBe careful about the language you use. Don't say things like, \"The doctor will cut you open\", \"You'll be put to sleep\", or other language that may be associated with a scary or sad event. Instead, say things like, \"The doctor is going to fix your stomach so that it won't hurt any more\", or \"They'll help you sleep for a few hours. When you wake up, I'll be there with you\".Portray the hospital workers as kind and helpful people, not as people who will punish your child for misbehaving.If your child is a literal thinker, try to avoid using figurative language at all, to lessen the risk of confusion.\n Your child may be very frightened of the upcoming surgery and regress to younger behaviors or start using harmful stims. Be patient and be there for them. Remember that it's normal for any child to regress to younger behavior when under stress, and that they need your support and care right now.\n\n\nIf your child is verbal or has access to complex AAC, encourage them to share their concerns with you. This can help you comfort your child about the things they feel worried about.\n\nValidate their feelings and make sure they understand that they aren't getting surgery as a punishment.Tell them that it's okay for them to cry and be scared.Try encouraging them to engage in therapeutic play, such as \"playing hospital\", before the surgery, to make the process more known and less scary. It will also help your child learn the routine of a hospital setting.\nDon't lie to your child to relieve their fear - they'll figure out that you were lying. If they ask if something is going to hurt, say something such as, \"Yes, it will hurt, but it will be over quickly\"., It's often recommended to feed your child soft \"safe foods\" after surgery, even if the surgery wasn't oral or gastrointestinal, and they're going to need some help managing their pain. Before your child's surgery, make sure that you purchase foods and pain relief medications, pick up any prescriptions, and any medical supplies that they may need (such as ice packs or bandages). Check with your child's doctor to see if there are any necessities.\n\n\nYour doctor may recommend getting over-the-counter drugs for your child's pain, such as Tylenol, or give you a prescription. Avoid aspirin-based OTC medications, and check with the doctor about whether ibuprofen is safe to use.\nGo shopping with your child, if they can handle it, to help them pick out foods and drinks that they'd like.\nPick out clear liquids and smooth, bland foods for your child. Examples include non-textured ice cream, pudding, apple or white grape juice, soft noodles, soup broths, and applesauce.\nYour child may be disappointed that they can't eat foods that they normally would eat, or that they have to eat only bland or smooth foods. Empathize with them and remind them that once they feel better, they'll be able to return to their typical diet.\n Your child will most likely need rest afterwards, so find things they can do. A child who is hyposensitive to pain will need activities to help them stay resting, while a hypersensitive child may be in a lot of pain and will benefit from distraction.\n\n\nStop by your local library for books and movies.\nVideo games may or may not be appropriate, especially if you have a big-screen TV where your child can lie down while playing games.\nConsider buying your child a gift they can enjoy while relaxing, such as a new book about their special interest, or a relaxing video game. This will cheer them up.\n Hospital passports are a strategy used to help accommodate autistic children in the stress of a hospital environment. Write down your child's likes, dislikes, sensory sensitivities and cravings, communication methods and strategies, ways to help them adjust, and things that your child is interested in.This can help the doctors and nurses work with your child, and gives information to anybody who gets involved in the situation a bit later than anticipated.\n\n\nTry making a few copies of the hospital passport, so that you can give them to nurses. You can also put one in your child's suitcase if they need to be admitted.\nYou may want to put other information, such as your child's medical history or emergency contact numbers, on the hospital passport.\n In the cases of some surgeries, your child may need to be admitted to the hospital while they recover to ensure that there are no complications. If your child will need to be admitted to the hospital, pack the bag with them, and tell them what you're packing. Pack them a bag that contains things such as:Clothes and/or pajamas\nShoes or slippers\nSmall travel-sized toiletries, such as shampoo\nToothbrush and toothpaste\nStim toys, preferably low-energy ones\nObjects or activities that the child enjoys, such as books, stuffed animals, or movies\nPreexisting medications - sometimes. Check with the hospital on whether to bring them.\nBe careful with bringing electronic devices. Some hospitals don't allow things like cell phones and tablets, and they're easy to lose or break. However, if your child needs an electronic device to communicate, talk with the hospital staff to see if they'll make an exception.\nDon't pack anything that you or your child would not want to get lost or broken, as things can get lost, damaged, or accidentally thrown away in the hospital.\n If your child has siblings, they'll need to be informed of the upcoming surgery and that your child will need to rest and recover. When discussing the surgery with the child's siblings, explain to them as much as they can understand, and encourage them to ask questions and express their emotions.Don't leave them in the dark about it, or they may become confused, scared, or betrayed - be upfront and honest.\n\n\nSiblings in particular may be feeling a range of emotions about your child's surgery, and may express them in ways such as acting out, trying to get attention (whether by constantly pestering you or pretending that they're sick), not eating or sleeping as much, withdrawing from friends or family, or requiring more attention than they used to.These are signs that they are under stress, and should be addressed.\nYour child's siblings may be worried about home life changing and them not being cared for as much. To combat these fears, set aside blocks of time for you to spend with your child's siblings, and keep the care routines as normal as possible. Offer extra encouragement and praise for them when they do good things., Your child's surgery will undoubtedly be stressful for you, too, and it's important to get support from others. Seek out help from friends, your parents or siblings (if possible), and/or your partner. If necessary, talk to a mental health professional about your fears. Don't let your fear and stress eat away at you.\n\n\nRemember, it's completely normal to be worried about your child during this time. You aren't being silly or having unjust fears.\nIf you have friends or family members who have also had a child who has undergone surgery, ask if they can give you some advice. While techniques for neurotypical children may not work for autistic children, there's some advice that is universal, such as the type of comfort objects your child should have, or how to ease your worries during the surgery.\n In many cases, your child will not be able to eat or drink anything starting from midnight of the night of the surgery, so it's best to make them a meal that they'll eat a lot of. Make sure they drink enough, too. Encourage your child to eat as much as they'd like, and maybe give them a treat for dessert afterwards.\n\n\nSome surgeries require that your child is on a specialized diet before the surgery.If this is the case, then you're unfortunately not going to be able to follow this step, unless there's something in the restricted diet that your child especially enjoys.\nIf your child has poor impulse control, hide the food away and stay with them to make sure they don't try and sneak food. If your child eats or drinks before the surgery, the surgery will have to be postponed or rescheduled.If your child needs to take medication in the mornings, discuss with the doctor whether or not they can take their medication on the morning of the surgery.\n This doesn't mean to put their clothes on for them if they don't need that kind of help, but to help them pick out clothing that is comfortable and won't get in the way. Choose clothing that is light, comfortable and can be easily slipped off, as they may have to change into a hospital gown.\n\n\nIf your child wears contacts, encourage them to wear their glasses instead.\nBring a jacket or sweater for your child. Hospitals are often cold. However, be careful with a sweater if you think your child will resist changing from their clothes to a hospital gown - it can be difficult to get them to take them off.\nIf your child has long hair, encourage them to leave it down. Buns and high ponytails can interfere with the ability to rest their head comfortably on the pillow. However, low-hanging hairstyles (such as side ponytails or braids) can help keep your child's hair out of their face and look great as well.\n Autistic children often stim to express emotions or keep calm in stressful environments, and it's not considered unusual for children to carry around a comfort blanket, toy, or object. Allow your child to pick out something that they can carry with them for comfort, and request that the doctors and nurses don't suddenly take it from your child.\n\n\nIt's best to take something big, rather than a small fidget toy, as these are less likely to be lost.\nFocus more on your child's comfort than whether the toy looks age-appropriate. It's okay for anyone of any age to be carrying around a big stim toy or stuffed animal if it helps them keep calm.\n You will probably not be able to leave the hospital while your child is undergoing the surgery, so bring things that can keep you occupied during the waiting period. Hospitals sometimes have reading material in waiting rooms, but consider bringing things like:\n\n\nWritten games (crossword puzzles, Sudoku, etc.)\nElectronic devices, if they're permitted, and any chargers for these devices\nWork projects\nBooks or magazines\n\n, When your child is being checked into the hospital for their surgery, make sure to mention any health problems that your child may have, and bring up their needed accommodations to the nurses working with them. It can be helpful to the nurses to remind them of your child's needs, which, in turn, helps your child.\n\n\nDon't be afraid to bring up your child's autism. If your child will need extra support because of their autism, it's actually best to bring it up so that the nurses are aware and can give your child some extra support and accommodations.\nIf you're bringing up your child's autism, say \"autistic\" or \"autism\" rather than \"Asperger's\" or \"PDD-NOS\". It's entirely possible the nurses aren't familiar with diagnoses of anything other than autism.\nAsk the nurses to avoid restraining your child under any circumstances to avoid panicking them.\n Since your child is under stress, it's quite possible that they may lose some of their abilities. Be extra patient with your child, and keep an eye out for things they might be struggling with.\n\n\nIf you suspect your child may lose their verbal ability, bring a form of AAC that they can use.\nThe stress may be especially overwhelming to your child if they get aggravated by sensory input, broken routines, or even just having not eaten for several hours.\nDo everything possible to help your child avoid a meltdown or shutdown.\n During the pre-surgery preparations, you and your child may need to wait, which can result in your child becoming anxious. Stay with your child and keep them company, and do whatever they find calming, whether that means that you don't say anything as they play with a stim toy or that you talk with them until the doctor arrives.\n\n\nRemind them that they will be okay, and that you'll be there when they wake up.\nIf your child is in pain, do what you can to distract them from the pain. That can be anything from distracting them with a TV show on the hospital TV, to offering deep pressure through a hug or rubbing their back or hand.\nHelp them redirect their stims if they begin using agitated and harmful stims.\n Many children are scared of needles and IVs, and it can be tough to get any child to cooperate with you when needles get involved. Distract them from the process by offering a stuffed animal, a stim toy or encouraging them to infodump while the IV is inserted. If your child is nonverbal, talk to them about a happy event or something that you know they really enjoy.\n\n\nIf your child is receiving anesthesia or sedatives through a mask, they may try to pull the mask off their face. Talk to them throughout the process and try to hold their hands (but don't restrain your child).\n\nNever pin your child down - restraining your child will result in them becoming fearful or panicked and fighting you, and these practices have been proven to not be beneficial.All autistic children are different. A hyposensitive child may not even feel the IV going in, while a hypersensitive child may attempt to jerk away from the IV in fear.\n Many autistic children find comfort in having a familiar person nearby, and parents are often encouraged to stay with their children before the surgery process anyway. You don't need to talk to your child (though it's recommended, to calm them); just being in the room with them can be a big help.\n\n\nYou will not be allowed in the operating room, which may frighten your child if they're still awake. Tell them that you'll be there when they wake up.\n When your child wakes up after their surgery, they'll likely be confused and disoriented. Talk softly to them and make sure they know you're there. It can take some time for your child to wake up fully, so be patient with how long it may take.\n\n\nDon't wake your child before they're ready, despite how much you might want to. They need rest, not only to heal faster, but to also allow administered pain medications to kick in.Some parents report their autistic child trying to pull the IV out of their arm.While the nurses are trained to deal with children doing this sort of thing, you may want to stay near your child during the wake-up process.\n When your child comes home, they're going to need different care than is normal for them, and you aren't going to be able to remember it all off the top of your head. You may either get this information during or after your child's surgery, but be sure that you receive post-operative care information in a written form so that you aren't left scratching your head in confusion when your child needs later treatment.\n\n\nPrint-outs from the doctor detailing post-surgery care can be useful, if they're available.\nTake notes on how to treat your child's wound, what activity they can and can't engage in, what they should and shouldn't eat, who to call if there's an issue, who the follow-up appointment will be with, and what symptoms are and aren't normal.\nWrite down the doctor's phone number in case you need to call them about your child's treatment.\n Many surgeries no longer require your child to stay for an extended period of time at the hospital to recover; however, some do, or there may be potential complications or health problems that result in the need for a longer stay. It's quite possible this will distress you and your child, especially if an unexpected event has resulted in the need for admittance, but keep it in perspective and explain it to your child. Remember, the hospital workers are trying to help your child get better, not take them away from you.\n\n\nMany hospitals will allow you to stay overnight with your child during their hospital stay. However, if that isn't the case, make sure they have comfort objects, enjoyable activities, and things that remind of them of home.\nIf you need to leave the hospital while your child is there, tell them where you are going, why, and when you should be back.If you need to be gone for long periods of time, have another family member (such as your partner) stay with them.\nConsider creating a schedule for your child if they need to be in the inpatient ward for more than a day, so that they have a routine., Your child may still be very tired from the anesthesia, but even if they aren't, it's important to make sure they rest to help the healing process. For the first few days, encourage them to rest as much as possible and to only get up to use the bathroom, and to let you know when they need something that requires getting up.\n\n\nWhen your child wants to sleep, roll them onto their side. It's not uncommon for children to vomit after having been under anesthesia,and if they're on their side, they're much less likely to choke if they vomit in their sleep.\nMake sure your child is resting, even if they feel capable of performing normally. A hyposensitive child may try to go about their life as normal, which can potentially injure them or slow their healing.\nIt's common for children to sleep more than usual for a few days after surgery, or to be wobbly and unsteady at first. Constipation, gas, urinary retention, nausea, sore throats or jaws, and dizziness are also common. These symptoms should wear off within a few days., If your child is still stressed out and is unable to communicate reliably, or if their surgery affected their mouth or throat, they may not be able to speak. Autistic children who can normally use one form of AAC may also need to temporarily regress to a simpler form of AAC while they recover. Pick out a form of AAC that would work best for your child, since they'll need to be able to communicate with you during recovery.\n\n\nA child of any age can try ringing a bell or pressing a button to call for you.\n\nThe Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), or cards with request words (e.g. \"drink\", \"toilet\", \"lonely\", \"hurt\") written on them, can be useful for requests or even expressing basic emotions, but can't be used for conversation.\nCommunication boards can be used to express emotions and requests, but they can't be used for conversation. It can also be hard for a child to use them if the surgery or effects of anesthesia have affected their motor skills.\nComplex AAC apps, writing, and typing can work for school-age children who have developed enough fine motor skills to use them.\n Early on in the recovery process, it's discouraged to give your child solid foods, but it's still important to keep your child hydrated. Make sure they have clear liquids easily accessible to them - such as water, apple juice, ginger ale, or Popsicles- so that they stay hydrated. It may be a good idea to keep a sealed cup with a straw by your child's bed, so that there's less of a risk of your child accidentally knocking it over.\n\n\nIf your child isn't vomiting, then you can try giving them a light meal, such as soup or crackers.Make sure that your child can tolerate the food's texture or flavor.\n Your child will probably not be able to do most things on their own, even if they're normally fairly independent. They may need round-the-clock care, or need to be checked on periodically. Make sure that your child is being cared for and checked on often enough, and that you're nearby so that they can call for you or otherwise get your attention.\n\n\nIf you need to leave the room for a short amount of time, get another person to watch over the child, or give them an object such as a bell to ring if they need you. Older children who have cell phones can be advised to text you.\nRotate caregivers. Maybe your spouse could watch over your child while you run out to the store or pharmacy, and your child's siblings could spend time playing board games with your child while you're making dinner.\nBring your child their box of stim toys if they feel the urge to stim.\n Your child may need to take medications, use ointments, have a hot or cold compress applied to the surgical site, have bandages changed, or otherwise need special care. Be sure to follow these instructions to help your child heal and prevent infection or illness.\n\n\nTalk with the child while helping them with these procedures, so that they aren't caught by surprise and they understand what's going on. For example: \"I'm going to put an ice pack on your neck now. It's going to be cold, but it will help your throat feel better and help you heal faster.\"\nDon't restrain your child during these processes, even if they struggle. It will just result in your child becoming fearful of these times. Work with them to find a way to make it manageable for them. If your child really will not cooperate no matter what you try, however, contact their doctor and ask if there's an alternative way of treating your child.\n Figure out who is in charge of the child's medicine, and make sure that everything is administered as instructed and according to schedule. Even if your child is older and more responsible, someone should be with them when they are taking their medicine, to make sure they are doing it correctly.\n\n\nDo not expect the child to keep track of their own medicine, even if they're normally able to. The exhaustion of surgery may make an otherwise-responsible child unable to reliably take medicine according to the doctor's orders.\nTry keeping a checklist to track what has been taken already.\n If your child is curious about things, they may want to explore the surgery site and its stitches. While you shouldn't discourage your child's curiosity, make sure they understand that they shouldn't touch the stitches or prod at the area around it. Tell them that if it itches, they need to not scratch, as it can break the stitches. Encourage them to learn about surgery by showing them age-appropriate books or websites about surgery and stitches.\n\n\nIf you suspect that your child will pick at or excessively touch their stitches, put soft pads or gauze over the stitches to prevent them from pulling the stitches out.\nBe especially cautious if the surgery was in an area that might be frequently touched on a regular basis (e.g. their hand or mouth). Help your child with tasks that involve this area so that they don't accidentally injure themselves or reopen the wound.\nPick pajamas and clothes for your child that are less likely to potentially rub against the surgery area and cause discomfort, or snag on stitches.\n Especially if your child's surgery requires an extended period of resting, it may be easy for them to get bored or restless, or they may want a distraction from the pain. Offer them activities that require minimal energy, such as:\n\n\nWatching TV or a movie\nReading books\nUsing a computer or tablet for games\nColoring in a coloring book, or drawing\nStimming with low-energy stim toys\nEngaging in their special interest, such as researching or using low-energy toys\nIf your child is further along in the recovery process, it may be okay to give them some higher-energy activities or stim toys. However, don't allow them to engage in intensive activities, sports, roughhousing, or any other activity that may potentially injure your child., Surgery can be very painful and stressful for an autistic child, so spend time with them and calm them down. If your child is struggling emotionally, it can help to have a loved one nearby.\n\n\nRead to them.\nHave conversations, if they are up for it.\nSit next to them while you do everyday things, like reading or fiddling with your phone.\nOffer cuddles if your child likes them.\n Hypersensitive children in particular may be extremely sensitive to pain and struggle with pain management after surgery. If distraction isn't enough, then you may need to administer pain medication, whether it's over-the-counter or prescription medication. Pain medications often exist in both liquid and pill form;choose what your child is capable of taking and tolerating, and follow the instructions on the prescription or on the post-surgery care instructions. Contact your child's doctor if your child is still in pain when the medication has kicked in.\n\n\nRecognizing pain in autistic children can be difficult, especially if they're hyposensitive or nonverbal. However, if your child seems extremely subdued or shows less interest in their activities than normal, is crying, is \"protecting\" the pained area, is expressing pain or making noises that suggest pain, is grinding their teeth, or is unable to use a part of their body (e.g. unable to stand after their leg was operated on), they may be in pain and need medication.Avoid giving your child ibuprofen or other NSAIDs unless their doctor says it's okay; these medications can cause stomachaches or diarrhea, and can cause potential health complications if your child has kidney issues, blood clotting or heart problems, or asthma.Check on your child's pain periodically. While some autistic children may have trouble using a plain 1-10 scale that's often used to describe pain, it may work to write down what the numbers would entail (for example, writing under 10, \"I hurt so much that I can't focus on anything else\"). It's best to give your child pain medication when the pain isn't extremely intense, since it can take longer for the medicine to take effect when the pain is extreme., If your child's school isn't on break, they'll most likely need to get the classwork and homework assignments that are being assigned. You or another caretaker of the child can pick up their homework and bring it home, or a friend or sibling who attends the same school can talk to your child's teacher and drop off the homework. It's best to not let it pile up until your child returns to school, since it can be immensely stressful to your child to receive a large stack of papers on a single day.\n\n\nEncourage your child to rest rather than do homework in the early days. Your child may be worrying about missing a lot of schoolwork, but after surgery, recovery is more important than schoolwork. It's often encouraged to prevent your child from doing heavy lifting (such as lifting backpacks or textbooks) after surgery, anyway.\nUse the internet to your advantage. Some teachers will offer homework assignments, lessons, or the daily schedule online, especially in the later grades. Others may be willing to send photocopies of the assignments over email.\nDepending on how long they are out of school, ask if they can record the day's lesson to review and catch up later.\n If your child has siblings, those siblings may get bored or frustrated more easily when your child is recovering from surgery, especially since your time has to be unequally divided between your children. To avoid your other children getting agitated or being unkind to your recovering child, involve them and have them help out and spend time with your child. Help them understand how your child is feeling and encourage them to play with and talk with your child to help them feel less lonely.\n\n\nOlder siblings may be able to help out with some mild care tasks, while younger siblings can help by playing games with your autistic child. Both age ranges can come and get you if your child needs something.\nDon't overwhelm them with sibling time - just set up a block of time for your child's siblings to spend with them (e.g. half an hour every few hours) so that your autistic child doesn't feel lonely and that their siblings are more involved. Be prepared to cut the time short, too.\nYounger siblings may pester your autistic child about the surgery and why they can't do what they can normally do, which can be a source of frustration for your autistic child. Make sure your younger children understand that they should talk to you about the more technical aspects of the surgery and recovery, and leave the personal questions (e.g. \"What was the hospital like?\") to your child.\n Your child may take some time before they feel they're ready for more than just liquids, and that's okay. However, when they're ready, try serving the soft foods you bought to your child to adjust them to eating more solid foods. Don't force your child to eat if they don't feel ready, though - just make sure they get enough fluid intake.Stay away from giving them food that has to be heavily chewed, food that's very spicy, or something that could otherwise interact with the surgical area and dislodge a blood clot.\nYour child may reject foods that don't align with their sensory preferences, or refuse to eat things that they may eat when not under stress. Don't take it as a cause for alarm - it's normal for autistic children to refuse certain foods under stress, and eating enough is more important than eating well.\n It's normal for your child to be disoriented or slightly groggy after the surgery. Hypersensitive children may also report frequent and intense pain. However, most of these symptoms should wear off a from few days to a week after surgery; if your child is not showing any signs of improvement, speak with the doctor as soon as possible, as illness after surgery may indicate a serious problem. Contact the doctor immediately if you notice that your child has any of the following symptoms:Fever or chills\nExcessive bleeding (however, oozing blood on bandages is often normal)\nPersistent vomiting, lasting for several days\nExcessive swelling around the surgical site\nSigns of infection - extreme pain to the touch (more than what's typical for your child), leaking pus or drainage, redness, hot to the touch, or a bad smell\nSigns of a poor or allergic reaction to a medication\nDifficulty breathing\nIrregular heartbeat\nSigns of shock - dizziness, confusion, loss of consciousness, clammy skin, severe sweating, low to no urine output, chest pain, anxiety or agitation, blueish lips or nails, and a rapid yet weak pulse, As your child recovers from surgery, they'll begin to feel more capable of taking on certain tasks, like working on their schoolwork or getting back into sports or clubs. However, they'll still need to rest, since their body isn't finished healing yet. Make sure that your child doesn't overwhelm themselves with work, and encourage them to do their activities slowly and cautiously, even if they feel like they don't need to go slowly.\n\n\nSet up allotted time for your child to work on a given activity, such as working on their homework. When the time is up, encourage them to rest, or give them a low-energy activity to do, like watching their favorite movie.\nMake sure they take breaks from daily activities, even if they feel like they don't need them. Returning to normal activities before the healing process has completed can be detrimental to your child's health.\n The recovery process can be frustrating, upsetting, or painful for any child, and your child may be moody, distraught, or irritable while they're recovering. You may be frustrated, too, whether because your child is irritable or because the recovery process is stressful. Remember, though, that your child can't magically make themselves get better and that taking out your frustration on them will upset them and make them feel guilty or like they're burdening you. Do your best to be patient with your child during the recovery process, without snapping at them or doing actions that would otherwise upset them.\n\n\nContinue getting support from family and friends. You're allowed to be frustrated or upset, and you don't need to feel guilty about it; it just isn't the best idea to express that in front of your child. Talking to others gives you an outlet without potentially upsetting your child.\nRemind your child when they're frustrated that they will get better, and that it's okay for them to be upset or annoyed at the recovery process. If they're verbal and lash out at you, don't take it personally - many people say things they don't mean when they're aggravated or upset.\nIt will be okay - your child will recover, even if it's not on the schedule that most people would expect, and they won't be in pain forever. Don't stress!\n\n"}

Hunting deer without a permit and the proper equipment, or hunting deer out of season is always illegal. Generally, a seasonal permit for deer costs between $40-$100.\n\n\nFor safety purposes, it's important to wear blaze orange to help distinguish yourself from the foliage, for other hunters who might be in the area. Contrary to popular belief, deer can't see well enough to make camouflage particularly effective, though it is helpful in making your movements less visible, which are what alerts deer to your presence.\nMany different rifles are used for hunting deer, a .243 up to a 30-.06 or 30-30 caliber will do perfectly well for any deer you're likely to encounter. Hunting with shotguns is somewhat less common, though deer slugs are available for hunting deer.\n\nBow hunting is also extremely common for hunting deer. In most areas, 45 pounds draw weight is the legal limit, which means you'll have a typical target distance from 20-60 yards.;\n, Talk to local hunters and visit the website of the local Department of Wildlife or Department of Natural Resources to learn about public areas permissible for hunting. State and National park lands are sometimes made available at particular times for hunting deer.\n\n\nIt's also common to hunt on private property with the permission of the local landowners. If you know someone with good rural deer-hunting property, get in touch and ask if you can come out next season.\nNever assume an area is safe for hunting if you're not sure. Never trespass on private land without the permission of the landowners.\n While your smell may seem insignificant in the woods, scent control is a big concern when you're hunting deer. Ideally, you want to avoid using scented soaps, deodorant, and being around any strong perfume-like smells for 24-48 hours prior to a hunt. It's common to avoid showering for a day or two before going hunting.\n\n\nKeep jackets and clothing in Rubbermaid containers with spruce bows to make you smell like the woods.\nNo drinking alcohol or eating fatty foods the night before hunting, so you're not exuding strong smells that will alert deer to your presence.\nSome hunters will layer baking soda in between layers of hunting clothing to try to mask their scent further.\n When you head out hunting, it's usually common to wander for a while and look for an ideal deer spot and set up camp to wait. You want to find evidence of a heavily travelled trail, preferably one that leads to an open area or meadow, depending on the weapons lethal distance.\n\n\nKeep an eye out for deer-friendly food sources, like apples or corn, as well as available water sources where deer are likely to congregate.\nIdeally, a field about 60 yds in diameter would be perfect for hunting deer. If you have a longer range rifle with an accurate, sighted-in scope, a larger meadow (300 yds long or so) would be desirable.\nOne of the most obvious signs of the presence of deer is antler rub on trees, which is done by bucks to mark territory and share scent., When you've found an ideal spot for hunting, set up camp and get to work making the deer come to you. There are lots of different ideas about how to camouflage yourself. Tree stands and blinds can be used in areas where game is likely to pass, but the thrill of tracking and sneaking up on a deer effectively is prized among certain hunters, who prefer to find cover in the wild. The choice is up to you.\n\n\n\nMake the deer come to you. Deer calls, estrus spray, urine, and rattling antlers are all common ways of attracting deer to your position, especially early in the season.\n Solo hunting can be dangerous and difficult, and it's always recommended that you go hunting with at least one other person. Packing out a whole deer by yourself is a challenge for even the strongest hunters, and the whole job is made easier and more fun with other experienced hunters to help the process along.\n\n\nAlways let someone else know where you're going hunting, and when you're likely to return for safety purposes, especially if you'll be out of cellphone range.\nDon't bring dogs when hunting deer. Although they're good to have around when hunting fowl and other birds, dogs are too loud and will only serve to scare off deer.\n There are a variety of positions from which it is possible to make an accurate shot, and a good hunter needs to be comfortable in all of them. Practice getting into position in a safe place with an unloaded gun, well before you go out hunting.\n\n\nProne position is the most stable, but it is the most difficult and impractical position to get into in the field, while standing is the simplest, fastest, and unfortunately most unstable. Crouching or sitting positions are the most comfortable and stable positions for shooting deer accurately, if done properly.\nYou can crouch quickly, supporting your elbow with your knee or thigh, making your aim more true and stable. In the sitting position, you'll sit cross-legged, perpendicular to your target, with the knee of your non-shooting hand pointing toward the target.\n Hunting deer is usually an all-day activity, not something to do when you're rushed or impatient. Find a good spot to sit in wait when you go out hunting, and give it some time. Deer are more likely to come around an area that's been silent and still for quite a while, so be extremely quiet as you do so.\n\n\nSome hunters like to give a spot a couple hours then move around some, while others like to roam more or less constantly. It's your choice how you want to hunt, but most successful hunters do some combination of setting up to wait and trying out different areas.\nThe waiting is part of the thrill and the drama of the hunt. If it wasn't challenging, nobody would bother.\n If you've spotted a deer, don't start pulling the trigger just yet. Use binoculars to look for signs of deer coming into the area and wait until one orients itself to your position in a way that offers you a clean shot. This is the most critical moment of the hunt, and the last thing you want to rush.\n\n\nDepending on the laws in your area and the type of permit you've acquired, take a minute to verify that the deer you're seeing is legal. Often, only bucks displaying a certain amount of antler growth (usually six points) are legal to harvest, though this varies from region to region.\nIf the first deer you see isn't legal, don't shoo it off. Wait. Deer often travel in pairs or herds and there are likely to be more deer coming soon.\n As you wait for the deer to orient itself to you, pull your rifle into position and obtain a good sight picture, aligning your eye with the sight of the rifle.While it's most common to aim just behind the shoulder of the deer, there are a variety of philosophies regarding where, specifically, you should aim on a deer, so the pros and cons of each spot follow:\n\n\n\nBehind the front leg, 5-7 in. up from the chest is probably the most popular spot to aim. This shot will penetrate the heart and lungs, though deer don't always go down immediately with this shot, and will sometimes recover, meaning that you often have to do some tracking.\n\nThe head, through the brain, offers an instant kill, and there is very little meat lost to a head shot. Typically, you'll aim just behind the eye to make this shot, a fairly advanced and difficult shot to make, with the potential for missing completely. It also renders the deer impossible to taxidermy for a trophy, if you're interested in saving the antlers or the whole head.\n\nThe neck, through the spine, is another popular and lethal spot, hit by aiming just behind the jawline of a deer showing you its broadside. This shot will often paralyze a deer, requiring a second shot or throat slit to finish the job, making it slightly less desirable.\n Once you've taken aim, you need to breathe, relax, and ensure that you make the most accurate shot possible. Switch the safety off your rifle and get ready to shoot. The most accurate and controlled moment to squeeze the trigger is the moment immediately following an exhale, so don't hold the rifle in place for too long, or you'll start to sway. Do it swiftly, carefully, and efficiently. BRASS is an acronym that will help you remember the procedure:\n\n\n\nBreathe\n\nRelax\n\nAim\n\nStop breathing\n\nSqueeze the trigger\n\n, Make sure you are 100% certain that what you're shooting at is a deer. Many hunting accidents happen because people don't get a clear picture of whatever it is they're going to shoot at. It's too late by the time you pull the trigger.\n\n\nIt's also important to be aware of your surroundings, so you know what's behind the deer as well. You don't want to be shooting towards another person, a private residence, a public road, or other places you wouldn't shoot.\n Wherever you've shot the deer, it will often take off, bounding away. It's important to wait a few minutes and not immediately charge after the deer, which can give the deer and adrenaline jolt, making the tracking job much more difficult. If you made a good shot, it won't get far and will lay down to die quickly, so waiting a few minutes won't make a bit of difference.\n\n\nTake care to remember the general spot you made the hit and the general direction that the deer took off. Mark the spot on your GPS if necessary.\n Head to the spot the deer stood when you shot it and examine the ground for signs of blood, then pick up the trail. You can also check out the quality of the blood for signs of how accurate your shot was.\n\n\nIf you see thin blood, or bile on the ground, you missed your shot and you'll likely have to track the deer quickly to make a more humane kill. A gut-shot deer will take a long time to die, so you've got a responsibility to find it and speed up the process.\n Deer move quickly, even when wounded, and it's possible for them to cover quite a bit of ground after being shot mortally. You may have to off-road it a bit, but if you've made an accurate shot, you shouldn't have to follow for more than a few hundred yards at most. It's important to examine the ground and foliage up off the ground for blood and follow the deer's trail.\n\n\nSome hunters like to use a bit of hydrogen peroxide to spray around foliage if the blood proves difficult to spot at any point. It should foam up and make the blood much more visible.\n When you come up on the deer you've tracked, examine it closely from afar before you approach. Watch to see whether or not it is breathing, or moving. If you hit the deer in the chest, foamy blood is a good sign. That means you've probably penetrated the lungs, and the deer should die very quickly, if it's not dead already.\n\n\nIf the deer is still alive and doesn't seem close to death, approach it carefully, maintaining a safe distance, before taking a more accurate shot through the brain or chest and putting it down.\nBe extremely careful when approaching a wounded deer. Some hunters like to use a knife to slit the deer's throat and let it bleed out, though an angry, wounded deer with a big rack of antlers can be extremely dangerous.\n As soon as the deer is dead, you should get to work field-dressing the carcass for safe consumption and breaking it down to a manageable size for packing out, or heading back to camp. Depending on where you are and how far out you are from where you're going, there are a variety of ways to approach the task.\n\n\nA good-quality and well-sharpened hunting knife is an invaluable tool when you're out hunting. You don't want to have just made a kill and find out you're without tools.\nIf you're close to home or camp, or have access to an ATV or other vehicle, you might bring the whole deer back and hoist it before skinning and gutting the deer.\nIf you've got a long hike on foot, remove the entrails and pull the major organs from the rib cage, being careful not to puncture the stomach or intestines. There will be several membranes attaching the organs to the spine, which you'll also need to cut. Generally, most hunters will then \"break\" the hind quarters and the fore, to make the carcass more easy for packing out, then butcher it later.\n\n"}

The only way to make a child crack a smile is to do something funny! Use that crazy voice or make that hilarious Grinch expression everyone loves to leave your young compatriot in stitches.;\n, Simply engaging in conversation with a young child can reveal multitudes about his or her personality. You can discover whether she likes to play soccer, read, play with Barbie dolls, or jump rope by just asking her what her hobbies are.\n Begin doing something you suspect may be interesting to a child (like Play-doh). Most children are very curious and will eventually gravitate toward you if they see you doing something interesting. If the child is under age of four, most activities will appear fun as long as you are smiling!\n\n, The great outdoors is a fabulous place for children to play. Suggest a day at the park or community swimming pool. It is safe to say that the majority of children are thrilled to go swimming. Just be sure to provide the proper supervision levels, depending on the child's age (a two-year-old requires constant supervision, while a 12-year-old can fend for himself with intermediate supervision).\n Children seem to find nothing more amusing than adults clambering over themselves or running into sliding glass doors. My younger sister gets a kick out of fall-down videos, and many children agree!\n\n, Disney movies never fail, and it is a sure thing that a child will have a favorite picked out.\n Most of us love the experience of going to the movie theater, enjoying popcorn and candy, and watching a movie. Children are no exception.

He will open up to you, but you might have to wait a little bit.\n Coloring books are fun for kids and adults alike. Teach your young friend how to color inside the lines, and she will teach you the importance of staying outside the lines!\n\n, Children love animals. If your dog is child-friendly, it is certain that your young companion will love him. Just make sure to clear it with the parents before you bring your dog over for a visit.\n Nothing evokes more awe and excitement in a child than being surrounded by an underwater environment. She will frolic among the fish for hours while you breathlessly try to keep up with her.\n Young children are just as fragile, if not more so, than adults when it comes to emotions. Maintain an honest relationship with a child, even when they upset you, but keep in mind that a child's mind is tender as well as malleable. Refrain from cussing or engaging in behavior you wouldn't want the child to emulate.\n Children don't do well with rigid structure. Learn to go with the flow, and you will have fulfilling and exciting interactions with young children!\n\n"}

Salmon is rich in Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. It also provides calcium to strengthen your bones, and minerals such as iron and potassium.Farmed salmon is plentiful, and available in any grocery store. There is some controversy about wild vs. farmed salmon \u2014 in the past, farm-raised salmon was considered to be inferior to wild, but it is becoming more accepted as a safe alternative to wild salmon. To find quality farmed fish, check with The Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), which creates sustainability standards for shellfish and fin fish aquaculture worldwide and is responsible for improving the quality expected of farmers.Salmon also is a good source of lean protein. The minerals and nutrients in salmon are essential for strong bones and muscles.\nA risk/benefit analysis by the Connecticut Department of Public Healthdemonstrated that eating salmon significantly lowers your risk of cardiovascular disease without any significant risk due to contaminants.;\n, Omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients that strengthen your heart and improve your brain functioning, including decreasing the risk of depression, ADHD, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Since your body doesn't produce omega-3 fatty acids, you must get them through food.\n\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids also especially important for infants, young children, and women who are pregnant or nursing. These nutrients aid in brain and nerve development.\nWhile you can take omega-3 fatty acids in supplement form, your body absorbs them better if you get them through eating fish.\nSalmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, as are other fatty fish such as herring, mackerel, oysters, sardines, tuna, and trout.\n Many fish carry mercury, which presents a significant health risk. The point system, based on data regarding the mercury content of fish compiled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can help you plan your fish meals over the course of a month.The risks from mercury in fish and shellfish depend on the amount of fish and shellfish eaten and the levels of mercury in the fish and shellfish. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are advising women who may become pregnant, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children to avoid some types of fish and eat fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury.\nGenerally, adults should eat fish meals containing no more than eight points in any given month.\nFish such as catfish, salmon, crab, scallops, pollock, tilapia, and trout are common fish that are only worth one point. They are very low in mercury.\nOn the other end of the scale, grouper, orange roughy, and marlin are worth eight points. If you eat these fish, you should only eat one fish meal that month to avoid consuming too much mercury.\nOther common fish that are relatively low in mercury include cod, snapper, and tuna, which are worth two points. If you buy tuna, buy canned light rather than canned white or Albacore tuna, which have three times more mercury.\nPregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children should not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury.\n Especially if you plan on eating fish more than once a week, variety ensures you won't get tired of eating the same thing all the time. This also helps you maximize the health benefits of your fish, since different species have different nutrients.Some fish, including shellfish, you shouldn't consume as often because of mercury and other contaminants. To keep your exposure under control, you have to plan your fish consumption.\nSalmon generally is safe to eat two or three times a week, as is canned light tuna.\nOther safe fish include anchovies and sardines, which you can easily add to a salad or other food such as pizza.\nKeep in mind that if you eat the maximum safe amount of a certain type of fish in a week, this does not mean you can supplement with other types of fish. For example, you shouldn't eat three servings of salmon and a serving of lobster in one week.\n If you go fishing, or buy fish that aren't already skinned, make sure you skin them and cut away the fat. This lowers the fat content, which will make the fish healthier for you to eat. It also reduces the amount of potential contaminants in your meal.After you've removed all the skin, cut away all fat along the fish's back and belly.\nMake a V-shaped wedge along the side of the fish to remove the dark fatty tissue and expose the healthy fillet.\nKeep in mind that skinning and trimming the fish won't do anything to reduce mercury content; however, it will protect you from other contaminants that may exist in the waterway where the fish was found.\n Baking or grilling your fish generally is the most healthy way to cook it, although fish is often fried. Whichever way you choose, put your fish on a rack that allows the fat to drip off and away from the fish as it cooks.Allowing the fat to drip away will make your fish a leaner meal. It also protects you from soil and water contaminants that may have been in the waterway where the fish was found.\nDispose of the drippings promptly. Don't use them in sauces or gravies. Apart from being full of fat that will decrease the health benefits of your fish, they also may contain harmful contaminants.\n Whatever method you use to cook your fish, it should reach an internal temperature of at least 145\u00b0F (62.8\u00b0C) before you eat it. You can buy a food thermometer at any discount or home goods store to measure the temperature of your fish.If you don't have a food thermometer, check your fish carefully to make sure it's completely cooked before you eat it.\nRegardless of the temperature, your fish should be opaque and easy to separate with a fork. If it still looks clear or shiny, you need to cook it longer.\n If you buy frozen fish, you'll find cooking instructions on the box. Make sure you don't deviate from these instructions, or you could expose yourself to unwanted contaminants and other health dangers.If you're baking, poaching, broiling, or grilling your fish, cook it at least 10 minutes for each inch of thickness. For example, if you're baking a half-inch thick salmon filet, you would cook it for at least five minutes.\nIf your fish is frozen, you generally should double that time, unless the instructions on the box tell you differently.\nEven if you microwave your fish, it's still important to check it and make sure it's cooked thoroughly and to the appropriate temperature.\n Generally, one serving of fish is about the size and thickness of your hand. You also can measure the appropriate serving size by apportioning one ounce of fish for every 20 pounds of body weight.\n\n\nFor example, for a 160-pound adult, the appropriate serving would be 8 ounces of fish.\nTypically a 6- to 8-ounce serving will be fine for adults, regardless of their body size. A serving half that size would be appropriate for children.\n If you plan to go fishing and eat the fish you catch, review advisories that apply to the locations where you're going. In the U.S., you typically can find a list of these advisories at the website of your state's fishing and wildlife department.Many lakes, rivers, and streams are contaminated with pollutants that, if ingested, can actually increase your risk of contracting certain diseases.\nThis contamination can negate any of the health benefits you'd enjoy from eating fish generally.\nTake particular caution if you are fishing in a lake or stream located near an active or formerly active factory or industrial site. These contaminants remain in sediment for years and can affect the quality of the water as well as the fish that live there.\nCatch and eat smaller, younger fish. They have experienced less contamination by their environment than larger, older fish.\n If you're pregnant or nursing, it isn't necessary to completely eliminate your consumption of fish. In fact, you need nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids that are found in fish.However, you should be more careful about the types of fish you eat and how often you eat fish if you are pregnant or nursing.\nEating fish with high levels of mercury can cause significant developmental problems for your child.\nFish that are safe for expecting or nursing mothers and small children include salmon, pollock, and shrimp. Most ocean fish don't have high levels of mercury and are safe to consume.\nTry to eat fish only once or twice a week, and buy your fish commercially rather than catching it yourself from local lakes, streams, or rivers.\n Both fish oil and Vitamin D, which you would get from eating fish, are available in supplements. If you don't like the taste of fish, or are concerned about contaminants in fish, you might want to take these supplements.Fish oil supplements, such as cod liver oil, may contain even more Vitamin D than a fish meal. If you want to maximize your health benefits, you may consider taking supplements even if you consume fish on a regular basis.\nKeep in mind that fish oil supplements contain no mercury, so they are safe for pregnant or nursing mothers, children, and others who are concerned about mercury levels.\n\n"}

Has something changed recently, such as you've only lately come to realize this about yourself, or been able to accept it?\nWhat does being bisexual mean to you? How has it played out in your life, and how do you see it informing your future?\nWriting out your feelings and ideas may help to compose them.;\n, Chances are, in the course of coming to terms with your sexuality, you'll have done a fair amount of research online. Still, it can be a good idea to round out your knowledge of bisexuality and relevant issues so that you will hopefully have some of the answers to the questions your spouse may have.\n\n\nAlso make\u00a0note of helpful websites that may be able to serve as resources for your spouse. Everyone processes differently, and it may be easier for your spouse to read information on a website later, at their own pace.\nResearch whether\u00a0there are any local bi organizations or community meet-ups you might be able to join. Bringing your partner with you into the bi community, and allowing them to meet other bi people, may help them accept bisexuality and understand how it fits into your life better.\n If your partner is the first person you are coming out to, it may be a lot for your spouse to both work through your revelation themselves and also be your sole confidant in your identity journey. Think about who else, after your spouse, you may want to come out to and have as a supportive resource.\n\n\nAlthough you may want to seek support from others before coming out to your spouse, be careful who and how many people you tell. Word can spread very quickly, and you want to be able to come out to your spouse on your own terms. You can always join an anonymous online forum to get some\u00a0motivation or a sympathetic ear from people whom you know can't out you.\n As with any coming out, timing is very important. Choose a time to tell your partner when you will both have ample time to talk and take things in, when you both won't be too stressed or busy.\n\n\nIt's a good idea to set aside a specific time in which to have the talk--maybe within the context of a special dinner date at home.\nIt's best to choose a place where you have privacy and you both feel comfortable.\nNever come out to your spouse during a fight. No matter how heated things may be in the moment, you will regret your slip of the tongue later. Receiving big news in a tense context will make it harder for your spouse to process it positively.\nWhile some find it easier to come out in writing rather than face-to-face, coming out in person can have its advantages, as you and your spouse can have a natural, in-the-moment dialogue.\n\n\n\nTell your spouse what being bisexual means to you and why you are coming out to them now.\nBe clear about what this means for your relationship. Has anything changed? Do you anticipate making changes in your life, now that you have come to accept this? Are you seeking to open the relationship? Make your perspective understood.\nTry not to be apologetic. You are being honest about who you are, and have nothing to apologize for.\n It is really nearly impossible to predict how someone will react to a coming out. Consider how you will take care of yourself and see to your own emotional needs if your spouse is initially upset.\n\n\nIt is also nearly impossible to predict how different someone's initial reaction might be from where they may arrive at on the issue later on.\u00a0Don't be discouraged if their initial reaction is less than enthusiastic. Many people can be initially shocked or overwhelmed, but with time can become the strongest of allies.\nIt bears repeating: always remember that people really do come around.\nYou may be prepared for disbelief, but it's always possible that you may wind up the surprised one--perhaps they will tell you they suspected it all along!\n\n, Although this is a time when you are explaining yourself, this is also a time when you need to be giving your partner space and time to process. You are seeking their support, but it's important to also be supportive and understanding of their position.\n\n\nListen carefully to what they have to say and try not to be defensive. Your partner may be very surprised and may not be considering their words carefully.\nAnswer any questions they may have. Try to be non-judgmental about what they may ask. Remember, although you've probably had quite some time to educate yourself about bisexuality and think things through, they are probably only considering this for the first time.\nAt a certain point, dependent on your spouse's personality, it may be best to leave them alone--give them space to process on their own for awhile.\n\u00a0Sometimes people slip into a state of denial and prefer not to talk about your coming out or your sexuality. Sometimes people need space in which to process. And sometimes it can be difficult to tell which of these is at play.\n\n\nIf your spouse doesn't want to talk about it again for a little while, be considerate of that, but don't let them completely drop the subject, either.\nFind ways to slip in little reminders of the conversation now and then, and practice trying to be open about your sexuality. You need to be sensitive to your spouse's feelings, but also respect your own need to be true to yourself.\n Some spouses will be immediately accepting, but others will need time to adjust their way of thinking and their perspective of you.\n\n\nEither way, fusing your newfound bisexual identity into your preexisting relationship is going to take time. Be patient, and enjoy the journey. It is always worth it: you are being true to you and allowing your partner to know you on a more honest level. That is the recipe for a much stronger, deeper relationship.\n\n"}

Whole, unprocessed foods will make you feel better by providing your body adequate nutrition and a steady supply of energy. Processed and high-sugar foods, on the other hand, can make your blood sugar crash, tanking your mood along with your energy levels.Focus on getting enough omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in your diet. These nutrients may be able to ease the symptoms of depression. Vegetable oils are a good source of omega-6 fatty acids, while fish oil and flaxseed oil are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.\nAvoid caffeine and alcohol, which can cause mood swings.\n Physical activity is well known for its ability to make you feel better mentally. When you get your body moving, it releases feel-good chemicals known as endorphins. Plus, you don\u2019t have to spend hours at the gym to feel the results.\n\n\nA quick walk around the block or a few minutes playing with your dog can be enough to lift your mood. You can even try several small sessions of exercise such as a morning walk and a brief evening yoga session to relax each night before bed., Stop expecting perfection from yourself. For that matter, don\u2019t expect yourself to be able to do what you could if you were well. Demanding too much of yourself will lead to unnecessary guilt, which might make your depression worse.Set small, appropriate goals and do as much as you are able to. Avoid beating yourself up if you make a mistake or don\u2019t finish everything you wanted to.\nIn fact, it can help to applaud yourself for even the smallest successes. You might say, Way to go, Becca! You got out of bed before noon today!\" Every little victory counts.\n Sunshine boosts your serotonin and vitamin D levels, both of which can make you feel better. Go outside for at least 15 minutes every day and soak up the natural light.If it\u2019s warm enough, wear a T-shirt and shorts so more of your skin is exposed to the sunlight. But, remember to use sunscreen if you\u2019re prone to sunburns.\nOpen your blinds to get more natural light indoors.\n Forcing yourself to think about something other than your depression can make you feel better. If it\u2019s hard for you to work up the initiative to stay busy, commit yourself to an activity ahead of time so you\u2019ll be more likely to follow through.Consider volunteering, spending time with friends, or picking up a part-time job.\nAvoid committing to demanding or high-pressure activities. For instance, you might not want to try going back to school when you\u2019re dealing with depression.\n Depression gives you a gloomy outlook on life, but you can change your mindset by challenging your negative thoughts. When you catch yourself mentally criticizing yourself, ask, \u201cIs that really true?\u201d Look for counterexamples. Make a point of reminding yourself of your positive attributes, even if it feels unnatural to do so.For instance, if you notice yourself thinking \u201cI might as well not exist,\u201d challenge yourself by thinking, \u201cMy pets need me, and my volunteer work helps other people.\u201d\n\n"}

Learn how to understand your partner, how to interpret what she says and pick out her emotional states. You should be able to tell when something's bothering her, and know what makes her feel better.\n\nAsk each other questions. Ask about what your partner likes and dislikes, what she wants to do in the next year or five years, where she's been, who her friends are -- anything can spark a story and get a great conversation going. Turn this into a game by keeping track of how many questions you ask, and try to reach 1000 first.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay games to get to know each other. To play Two Truths and a Lie, tell your partner two true things and one false thing about yourself, and have her guess which is the lie. Or make a quiz about yourself and send it to her. Have her do the same, and compete to get the most answers right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse multiple methods of communication. Talking on the phone is great for certain kinds of conversations. Email encourages more thoughtful discussions of weightier topics, while texting is great for a quick, light-hearted chat. Use more than one method of communication to get to know all sides of your partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, Discuss topics like what you want to get out of the relationship and where you see it going. Commit to the trust and communication that sustain a long-distance relationship. Understand the difficulties you will face and talk about them with your partner, but at the end of the day, if the relationship is going to work, you both need to fully dedicate yourselves to it, without hesitation.\n Encourage your partner to trust you by always proving yourself worthy of her trust. Follow through on your promises, even the small ones like calling her at a specific time or responding to a message. If you ever find that you can't follow through on a promise, have a very good reason why, explain this to her, and ask for -- don't demand -- her forgiveness.\n It's hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and it's hard to build a relationship when you don't know what's going on in your partner's life. Make sure you talk often so that you can participate in her life, and you can feel her presence in yours. Regular communication is the key to sustaining any relationship, but this is especially true for long-distance ones.\n Honest and open communication is just as important as talking often. If something is worrying you, your partner should be the first to know. If she's feeling upset or frustrated, she should be comfortable opening up to you. If you are consistently open with your partner, she will learn to trust what you say and will feel more comfortable in the relationship. Be completely honest with your partner and trust that she will with you.\n This will allow you to better understand your partner's daily life, and being friendly with the people in her life can help both of you feel more involved with each other. Her friends will also appreciate the chance to get to know the person taking up so much of her time and energy. This increased involvement with your partner will help you build trust in your relationship.\n Although you may want to spend every moment of every day talking with her, recognize that she needs time and space to live her own life. Don't pressure her to give you more of her time and energy than she's comfortable with. Trust that she will come to you when she needs to, and allow her the space to be her own person within your relationship.\n\n\nFinding the right balance between personal space and regular communication is perhaps the hardest part of a long-term relationship -- and the balance is different for every couple. Experiment and check in with each other regularly to see what works and what doesn't. Work together to find a balance that lets you both be as happy and as healthy as possible.\n Discuss how you both feel about how your relationship is going. Talk about whether you feel happy, comfortable, and confident in the relationship, and what each of you could do to make it even better. If one of you feels dissatisfied for any reason, discuss the problem and work together to figure out a solution that you're both comfortable with. Recommit to your partner and the relationship, taking into account whatever changes, if any, you've discussed.\n\n\nRegular check-ins give you a way to make changes to the relationship or even end with mutual understanding and without unnecessary pain, it if and when that becomes necessary. Though it may seem tedious, pessimistic, or even silly, long-distance relationships are a lot of work and this is a good way to make sure it's still working for both of you.\n Your partner will likely do or say something that might confuse or alarm you. She might not return a call, or she might make a snide or offensive comment when talking to you. Don't jump to conclusions about her intentions when this happens -- assuming that she's hiding something or deliberately antagonizing you is a great way to insult her and damage your relationship. Instead, assume that there's a perfectly valid, reasonable explanation for whatever she did, and ask to her about it the next time you talk. Always assuming good intentions will foster trust and good feeling, and is crucial in sustaining a long-distance relationship.\n This cannot be stressed enough. A long-distance relationship, even more so than any other relationship, is predicated on mutual trust, and accusing your partner of cheating, or even of wanting to cheat, destroys that trust on both sides of the relationship. Never assume that your partner has been unfaithful, and never confront him or her about it. If you are open with each other and committed to your relationship, she will confess any infidelity to you, and then you can deal with it in a healthy and positive way. If you accuse him or her, you introduce suspicion into both sides of the relationship, ultimately and irreparably damaging it.\n As with any relationship, it's inevitable that you will at some point get annoyed or angry at each other. When this happens, address the conflict calmly. Discuss your disagreement. Make an effort to understand her side, and explain to him or her how you feel. Work together to come up with a solution, and make sure you're both happy with the resolution. Regard disagreements as an opportunity to build up your relationship, rather than something that could tear it apart.\n Understand that a long-distance relationship is difficult for both of you and requires a lot of work and effort, when there are many other things you could be doing with that time and energy. If your partner is worth the sacrifice, you should be happy to make it. But don't let the relationship consume your life. You need time to devote to work, school, family, and your social life apart from your relationship. If it feels like you aren't able to give enough time to your other friends and activities, it may be time to work with your partner to reevaluate your relationship.\n If the only thing you talk about is what you did that day, you're bound to get bored pretty fast, and this can quickly take the heat out of your relationship. Expand your conversations by asking questions, teaching your partner about something new you're learning, discussing books and movies you've enjoyed, or playing a game together.\n\nGo on virtual dates. Watch a movie together online, play a MMORPG or other online game together, or eat the same meal while on the phone together. This can simulate the shared experience that you get from dating in-person, and this will help you build your conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake an online class together. This will stimulate conversation and challenge yourselves intellectually, which can add new energy to the relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back to the beginning of your relationship, where you were just getting to know each other. Ask the same kinds of questions, and focus on learning new things about your partner. There will always be things about her that you don't know, and this can be a great way to renew your interest in the relationship.\n Even if you can't see each other often, always have a place and date set for the next visit. This will give you both something to look forward to. It can guide your relationship and help you move forward together without necessarily entailing definite long-term plans. Make the most out of your visits, even if they are rare, and always be thinking about the next one.\n\n"}

Is it their size? Did the animal do something bad to you in the past? Discovering this piece of information brings you one step closer to getting over you're fear of horses.;\n, Accept and think about the reasons on why you are afraid of horses. This will help you understand your fear and possibly conquer it.\n\n\nFocus on the positive instead of negative. Instead of thinking of all the things that can go wrong when being near horses, think about all the good things.\n The book content will teach you to be cautious, but will also explain clearly how to have a good time with horses. You will learn how great horses are through learning about their habits, their physiology, their needs and their behavior. Understanding horses better is an important way to conquering the fear.\n This is a big step so do not rush it; only attempt this if you feel comfortable with it and know you can do it.\n Go to shows, or just hang out or volunteer at your local barn. Being around horses will help you to see that they are not so bad. When a human is training a horse not to spook, the constant exposure is what eventually makes the horse realize that there's nothing to fear. You will find the same thing can calm your fear too.\n\n\nIf you are afraid of a specific horse, ask the instructor if you can lead the horse, help others tack him up, or give him a bath. Doing things other than riding the horse but still involving interaction will help you to gain confidence in you ability to handle the horse.\n Explain that you are trying to get used to horses, and they will pair you with a gentle, reliable horse or a pony. If you are not ready to ride, don't let anyone force you. Just pat the pony and realize that he will not hurt you.\n\n\nBring a close friend or family member along. They will most likely encourage you and take your mind off your fear. If you have a friend or family member who has experience with horses (or has rode a horse before) then take them along too! At least then you will have someone who knows what its like to ride a horse.\nObserve the horses. It is perfectly fine to keep your distance and to be scared of certain movements, but understand that most horses that people own are very friendly and not dangerous at all.\nAsk questions about the horse. Don't hold back as understanding a horse is very important and the owner of the horses will most likely be very happy to answer them.\n You can groom the horse, feed it and more importantly, bond with the horse. Do not let any movement discourage you, this is perfectly normal as some horses are sensitive to brushes.\n\n\nFeed the horse a treat (with permission of course). Lay your palm flat with the treat in your hand, even try to pet or stroke the horse.\nPet and offer the horse treats. This will boost your confidence and make you bond with the horse, you might even get attached.\nLead the horse with the rein. Remember to stay on the left side of the horse and to hold the reins securely and tight in your hands.\n Have someone supervise you, in case you lose your nerve. Ask for a quiet horse that is known to take care of beginner riders; most stables will have at least one such caring horse.\n\n\nOnly do this if you know you have the confidence to do this. Be sure that the owner is assisting you whilst riding. He should be leading the horse rather than you riding on your own for the first time.\n\n"}

This means the judge can decide whether to award alimony or not, depending on a variety of circumstances. In about half of the states, the judge will consider \u201cmarital fault,\u201d including adultery.You need to find out if your state considers adultery. You should research your state law. Search online for \u201cyour state,\u201d \u201calimony,\u201d and \u201cadultery.\u201d;\n, If you can\u2019t find out whether your state considers adultery when deciding alimony, you should consult with an attorney. Only a qualified attorney can give you accurate legal advice about your state law.\n\n\nYou can get a referral to a divorce attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Call up the attorney and schedule a consultation. Ask how much they charge for a half-hour meeting.\nYou should also consider hiring the lawyer to represent you. Although you can meet for just a half-hour meeting, you might be better off hiring him or her to handle the divorce for you. Ask how much it would cost.\n Although some states consider adultery when determining alimony, it depends on the circumstances. You should discuss your situation with your lawyer.\n\n\nFor example, in Georgia, the adultery must have been the cause of the divorce. It isn\u2019t enough that your spouse cheated five years ago but you reconciled. Instead, the infidelity must have ended the marriage., Your state might not allow a judge to consider adultery. However, you can still try to deny your cheating spouse alimony. Generally, judges consider the following financial factors:Income disparity. If your income is much higher than your spouse\u2019s, then a judge is more likely to award alimony. However, if your incomes are similar, you have a strong argument against alimony.\nEach spouse\u2019s future earning potential. Your spouse may not be working now. However, he or she could have a college degree and higher earning power if they got a job. A judge will consider how much your ex \u201ccould\u201d make, not how much they do make.\nYour standard of living during the marriage. If your spouse became accustomed to a high standard of living, then the judge might award alimony. However, if you had a normal middle-class life, then you could argue that alimony isn\u2019t appropriate, especially when your spouse can maintain that lifestyle on their own.\nWhether your spouse stayed home to raise the children. If your spouse didn\u2019t forfeit their career for your family, then you can argue alimony isn\u2019t necessary.\nThe contribution your spouse made to your career. A spouse who works to put another through school or helps start a business has a stronger claim to alimony. You should point out if your spouse didn\u2019t make any kind of contribution to your career.\n In addition to finances, a judge will consider other factors when deciding whether to award alimony. You should try to cite as many as possible to argue against your spouse getting alimony:The length of the marriage. If your marriage was short, then you can argue that alimony isn\u2019t appropriate.\nYour spouse\u2019s age. Your spouse is more likely to get alimony the older they are. If your spouse is relatively young, you can argue alimony isn\u2019t necessary.\nYour spouse\u2019s emotional or physical condition. If your spouse is disabled, then he or she will have a strong argument for alimony. However, if your spouse is healthy, then you can argue alimony isn\u2019t necessary.\nDomestic violence. In California, for example, the judge can lower or eliminate alimony if one spouse has been convicted of domestic violence., You might not be able to prevent alimony, even if your spouse cheated. Nevertheless, you should discuss other potential strategies with your attorney for making sure your spouse gets as few assets as possible.\n\n\nFor example, your spouse might have used marital property to support a lover. In this situation, the judge can deduct the money spent on the lover from the amount of marital property your spouse will get in the divorce., If your spouse pick up an STD during an affair, then you might be able to sue him or her for personal injury if the STD was transmitted to you.You should talk about this option with your lawyer.\n You need proof that your spouse has been unfaithful.Although you can tell the judge your suspicions, nothing is more powerful than evidence. In particular, you should try to get your spouse to admit to being unfaithful.\n\n\nIf your spouse admits to cheating, you should write down the day and time of the admission. Because your spouse might try to walk back the admission, you should look for other evidence.\nKeep communications. Your ex might slip up and admit to adultery in an email or letter. You should hold onto these communications. You can introduce them into court as evidence.\n You can also get evidence of adultery by talking to the person your spouse slept with. He or she might confirm that they slept with your spouse during your marriage. A partner is probably more likely to admit this if their relationship with your spouse has ended.\n You don\u2019t have to videotape your spouse \u201cin the act\u201d with someone else. However, you need to prove that he or she had the motive and the opportunity to cheat on you. You can prove motive and opportunity by gathering the following:Photos of your spouse and their lover together. It would be ideal if they were acting in an intimate manner in the photographs.\nPhone records that show constant communication between them. Look for late-night calls or calls on the weekend.\nWitnesses who saw your spouse and their lover together.\nCredit card or bank records that show large purchases, hotel visits, etc.\n If your spouse has moved in with his or her lover, then you might be able to eliminate alimony altogether.Some states will prevent a person from getting alimony when they move in with a romantic partner.\n\n\nYou can ask family or friends where your spouse is staying. You may need these people to testify on your behalf.\n You might need to hire someone to spy on your spouse. You should think about hiring a private investigator.This person can follow your spouse around and find out who they are spending their time with.\n\n\nPrivate detectives generally charge $40-100 per hour. They also charge for additional costs, such as mileage.You can find detectives in the phone book. Call one up and discuss the reasons for hiring them. Discuss the scope of the investigation and what kinds of evidence you want them to gather.\n You should probably be the person to file for divorce. You should pick up the forms required to file for divorce from the court clerk at the family law court in the county where you live. Often, these forms are posted online.\n\n\nDivorce can be \u201cfault\u201d or \u201cno fault.\u201d Almost all states have \u201cno fault\u201d divorce, which means neither party is to blame. However, about two-thirds still allow you to allege \u201cfault,\u201d such as adultery.If you have the option of alleging fault when you file for divorce, then make sure to select adultery.\nSome \u201cno fault\u201d states, such as Florida, still consider adultery when determining alimony.For this reason, even in a \u201cno fault\u201d state you should try to mention adultery in the divorce petition.\nYour spouse might have beat you to the courthouse and have filed for divorce first. He or she should ask for alimony in the petition. In this situation, you will be able to \u201canswer\u201d the divorce petition and explain why your spouse isn\u2019t entitled to alimony.Mention the infidelity and all other reasons.\n You have to file your papers with the court clerk. Make several copies. You also have to give your spouse a copy of everything you file in your case.This is called \u201cmaking service.\u201d\n\n\nYou can generally make service of divorce papers by paying the sheriff or constable to serve them. You cannot serve them yourself.Depending on your court, you can also hire a private process server, which you can find in the phone book. They make service for a small fee.\nYou might also ask someone 18 or older who isn\u2019t a party to the case to serve the papers for you.\n In a contested divorce, you will need to have a trial or hearing. You will probably have many preliminary \u201cstatus hearings\u201d and conferences as you prepare for your hearing/trial. At these, you will appear before the judge and hammer out issues that will allow you to prepare for trial.\n\n\nYou may also have a chance for \u201cdiscovery.\u201d Discovery is the fact-finding portion of a divorce.In discovery, you can send subpoenas to people requesting documents, such as financial records. You can also have your spouse answer questions under oath. If you weren\u2019t able to get solid proof of adultery before filing for divorce, then you can use discovery to gather additional, helpful information.\n You should identify your witnesses and ask them to attend the hearing. Tell them the date, time, and location. You may also send them a subpoena, which is a legal request to show up.\n\n\nYou can generally get a blank subpoena form from the court clerk., You can have witnesses testify and introduce documents to convince the judge that your spouse committed adultery. In many states, you don\u2019t actually have to prove that adultery happened. Instead, you need to prove that your spouse had the \u201cdisposition\u201d and \u201copportunity\u201d to cheat.To prove disposition, you can introduce evidence that your spouse showed affection publicly with their alleged lover. You can introduce photographs of them kissing, hugging, holding hands, etc. Or you can have witnesses testify that they observed this conduct.\nTo prove \u201copportunity,\u201d you should introduce evidence that your spouse was seen entering their lover\u2019s apartment late at night and not leaving until the morning. Alternately, you could show that they went away together and stayed in the same hotel.\n Your spouse gets to try to prove that any conduct was innocent and not actually adultery. Depending on your state, your spouse may also argue that they are entitled to alimony even if adultery occurred.\n\n\nYou should be able to cross-examine any witnesses your spouse has testify. See Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for more information.\n Currently, only two states allow jury trials in divorce proceedings, so your case will likely be decided by a judge.The judge should make a decision after hearing all of the evidence. If your case is complicated, then the judge may take the case under advisement and issue a ruling at a later time.\n\n"}

Disinfect the area before proceeding with grooming., Look for any fecal matter that might have gotten matted in with your cat's hair. This is often a problem in older cats and cats with long hair.

Stir occasionally.\n Remove the stems and cut the mushrooms to your desired thickness, usually around 1/2 a centimeter each. You want roughly 1-2 cups of mushroom, depending on your preferences.\n This usually takes 3-5 minutes. Translucent onions are almost, but not quite, see-through. Add salt and pepper and stir everything to coat the vegetables in oil.\n\n\nThis does not need to be an exact science -- if you think the onions are translucent, go ahead and add the mushrooms.\n Using a medium sauce pot or the microwave, heat up all of your broth on medium high heat. It does not need to be boiling, just hot to the touch.\n\n\nIf you add cold broth to your rice you greatly lower the temperature of the pan, effectively halting cooking and preventing the rice from absorbing the liquid., The mushrooms should look slightly wilted, and they will have sucked up the liquid in the skillet. For a slightly healthier risotto you can skip the butter. Herbs to add include 1 teaspoon of the following (if using fresh, instead of dried, herbs, double the amounts).\n\n\nThyme\nSage\nRosemary\nBasil\nCracked red pepper.\n Once the butter has melted, add the rice and stir so that it is coated with the oil and butter. Cook for 1 minute, until the edges of the rice begin to appear clear. This is also known as \"toasting\" the rice. You want to do this before adding any liquid.\n\n\nCooking the rice without liquid hardens the starch on the outside, preventing it from sticking together later.You can also use baldo or carnaroli rice for a creamier texture.\n Add the white wine and stir into the rice. Cook together until almost all of the wine is evaporated or absorbed into the rice. Don't worry, the final dish will not be alcoholic -- most of the alcohol will burn off.\n\n\nWine \"deglazes\" the skillet, removing tasty bits of caramelized vegetables from the pan and adding them to the rice.\nMove on once all of the wine is absorbed.\n Once the wine is absorbed, use a ladle to add the first cup of broth to the rice mixture. Resist the urge to add more than one cup -- you need to take it slow to get the best risotto you can.\n\n\nToo much liquid, too quickly, will lead to mushy, unappetizing rice. Take it slow -- the patience will pay off., You cannot stir risotto enough. Though you can leave the pan briefly if you need, the more you stir the risotto the better the texture and flavor will be when you are done.\n Once most of the broth has been absorbed by the rice, add another cup. You'll know when it is absorbed, as there are no more puddles or visible liquid.\n The rice should be slightly firm and creamy, but never mushy. Depending on the amount and quality of rice, you may need 1 cup more or less. After about half the broth is added, taste it regularly to get your desired consistency.If your rice is still hard but you are out of broth, add a little water or milk and continue stirring.\n Add any salt and pepper you desire and garnish on top with Parmesan cheese or truffle oil.\n Make sure the cream of mushroom is hot before adding it, and add the cream of mushroom last to make sure the rice cooks properly.\n Red wine imparts a somewhat richer flavor on the risotto, and it often pairs well with the earthy, nutty flavor of mushrooms. Try to use a dry red wine like a Pinot noir or Chianti, or better yet use Sherry or Marsala -- two wines commonly used for cooking.\n Cook your meat and vegetables separately and add them to the risotto with your last cup of broth.

Make sure you're allowed to bring your dog on the plane and figure out the cost and requirements for air travel with a dog.Airlines often charge extra for you to bring a dog with you. It can cost anywhere between $200 and $2,000 to transport a dog from overseas.\nIf cost is an issue, reach out to a charity organization like Pilots N' Paws to see if they can help with some of the cost. If you're already working with an adoption agency, they may be able to have the dog transported for you at a reduced rate.\n If it's not possible to have a dog on an airplane with you, you may be able to check the dog as baggage or unaccompanied cargo. The dog would still be on the plane, but not in the cabin with you. Explore these options if your airline does not allow dogs on the plane., The majority of countries will have some form of airport inspection. This is usually conducted by a veterinarian at the airport. The purpose is to make sure your dog is disease free before it enters your country.You may also have to present paperwork, such as a proof of rabies vaccination, at this point. Make sure you have your paperwork ready to go when you meet with an airport veterinarian.\nYou want to make sure you enter the country when the airport vet is ready to conduct an inspection. Some airports may not have vets on staff all the time, so getting your dog past customs may require some waiting.\n Local regulations for overseas pets vary, even within the same country.

Apply moisturizer as needed over the next 12 hours or more to keep your skin from drying out, since moist skin tans more effectively than dry skin. Be doubly certain to do this if you shower, swim, sweat profusely, or are otherwise exposed to liquids after tanning, since these activities may wash off previous applications., Wait 24 hours at the bare minimum before tanning yourself again, whether indoors or outdoors. If you have Type 2 skin, wait at least 48 hours before your next session. To err on the side of caution, wait 72 hours, regardless of your skin type.Again, people with Type 1 skin should refrain from tanning in general. If you decide to do so anyway, always give your overly sensitive skin the maximum amount of rest in between sessions.\n Limit yourself to a maximum of two or three per week if you only tan seasonally. If you plan on tanning all year long, stick to roughly once per week. Limit yourself to 60 sessions in total for the entire year to avoid overexposure."}

And watching people is not about feeling superior to others or judging them; more than anything, you're a non-judgmental observer with a penchant for unearthing life's stories as an art of love and empathy. Some reasons for people watching include:\n\n\nIt's relaxing and enjoyable - Seeing other people have fun, dressed up, going about daily activities is enjoyable and even soothing as you sit somewhere comfortable in a cafe or park bench under the sun. People are fascinating, so this reason really needs no more explanation!\nIt passes time while you're waiting for someone or while you're sitting with people who don't interest you much but you're obliged to stay with them.\nIt restores a sense of wonder. Children are renowned for people watching and just by trying it again, you can regain this sense of wonder for a brief moment of time.\nIt's informative. If you're writing a book or developing characters for a play, observing people can be an excellent way to find traits and styles for your characters. In addition, if you're an actor, observing other people is a window to other ways of standing, walking, talking, and interacting in a natural environment. And it's a great opportunity to test your learning or theories about body language.\nIt's an excellent source of artwork or photography. If you're an artist or a photographer, unaware people can make brilliant subjects.\nIt's inspiring. Watching people can lead to writing a symphony, movie script, or a blog post.\nIt's a healthy and much more interesting alternative to Facebook or Instagram stalking.;\n, Naturalistic observation is the practice of observing subjects in their natural habitat.This means being unobtrusive, unnoticed, and non-interfering. The moment you become any of these things, the spell is broken and you've interacted and it's no longer \"people watching\".\n\n\nRealize that some places are better for people watching than others. New York City, Paris, Miami, Rio de Janeiro and Venice present ideal venues for people watching because people know they're on display, and being seen. Any city where people dress up to show the world their fashion flair or sense of style is likely to be an ideal people watching place. Less so the country town or the little city unless you can do so with great care and not draw attention to yourself.\nSome observation methods are likely to be more acceptable in some places than in others. Taking photos of people in New York City usually won't have anyone blink an eyelid; doing so in the only main street of a local town might raise concerns. Know where it's fine to take shots of people and where it's frowned upon and don't cross that line. If someone does see you taking photos of them and they don't like it, oblige them by erasing the shot; this isn't about causing bad feelings.\n The tried and true locale is sitting in a cafe looking out on a busy street. This is the classic Parisian positioning and even if it's cold, find yourself a suitably large and clean window to peer through. There are plenty of other options though, including:\n\n\nUpstairs balcony of a shopping center.\nUnder a tree at the park, sitting around at lookouts,or anywhere that tourists and locals like to congregate.\nSitting around a public pool or at the beach; at a party or a rave (it's interesting to watch how people change as the event goes on).\nAs people enter or leave a movie theater, play, doctor's office, etc.\nTaverns, pubs, bars, etc.\nTheme parks, zoos, aquariums, and other places where your feet invariably get sore and you just need to sit down and watch the world pass by.\nDog runs. Where dogs socialize, so are their owners.\nStores, including thrift stores and bookstores.\nArt galleries and museums.Observing people observing something else can be very entertaining, especially those people who discuss what the subjects in the painting are thinking - how far can you peel this Russian doll?!\nDon't neglect public transportation; it's prime people-watching territory as you're all glued to the spot staring at one another!\n\n, The important thing is to place yourself somewhere that you won't look conspicuous. This means making it appear that you're already occupied and not simply staring at people:\n\n\nLook busy by reading, writing, or have something else to do while you watch.\nEat a meal or drink coffee or tea while you watch.\nWear sunglasses that make it hard to tell where you're looking.\n Find a person who grabs your attention and who isn't about to disappear before you've a chance to observe them properly. While observing them, think about what sort of person they might be:\n\n\nAsk yourself questions about each person you choose: Why are they here? Are they happy? Nervous? Irritable? Why? What does the way they hold themselves say about them? What about the way they talk? Does it match up?\nLook at their clothes: What do their clothes suggest about them? Are they wealthy or poor? Are they stylish or completely clueless about fashion? Are they adequately dressed for the weather or not? Are they part of any pop culture or sub-culture?\nFrom their style and mannerisms, what do you think this person's aspirations, politics, or job would be?\nSpot \"doppelgangers\". This means trying to see people who look like people you know or well-known people such as movie stars. Who knows, you might even see a real one!\nDo you recognize anyone? As you age, the people passing by you might be former lovers, bosses, teachers, or classmates. Keep your attention focused!\n\n, It can be twice the fun to people watch with a friend who is attuned to the art of people watching. Ask one another the questions outlined in the step above. You can even dispute each other's findings until you reach a shared conclusion that pleases both of you! Being able to share your thoughts on people watching can be both a fun and deeply connecting friendship ritual.\n This step is optional and for some people might turn people watching into a bit of a chore. However, if you're absolutely dedicated to people watching as a regular hobby, you might enjoy recording your thoughts about the people you've observed, and if you're an author (including bloggers) or an artist, you can build on these observations to inspire your writing or art.\n\n\nCarry a notebook and pen around with you on days you decide to people watch. Make it a special book just for that purpose - turn the event into a ceremony. Write down the details of what you see and hear from each person, if you can sketch the way they hold themselves. It'll keep the process interesting and you'll have subjects to keep for years.\nConsider your observed people potential character stock for your novels and record every mannerism.\nTake painting or acting classes if you'd like to record your people watching moments unobtrusively without a camera.\n So that you don't come across as a voyeur or nosy body, be conscious of other people's need for privacy, space, and respect people at all times. Realize that you too are likely the subject of observation now and then, perhaps even as you're people watching one fine afternoon.\n Sometimes you will get caught observing and it will be considered staring. There are a number of ways to respond:\n\n\nSimply smile, shrug, and look away.\nEngage them in conversation if close enough, and explain what was so engaging or beautiful about them that made you look again.\nJust look down and don't look up again until they've gone. For when you're feeling a little sheepish or afraid!\nPhysically turn away or get up and go if things seem uncomfortable.\n\n"}

A reaction paper is not just a paper where you express your opinion.These papers require a close reading of the text that goes beyond the surface meaning. You must respond to implied ideas, and elaborate, evaluate, and analyze the author's purpose and main points. In many cases, you can use the first-person \"I\" while writing reaction papers.When you respond to the text, back up your ideas with evidence from the text along with your own connection of ideas, texts, and overarching concepts. If you are asked to agree or disagree, you have to provide convincing evidence about why you feel this way.If responding to multiple texts, you must analyze how the texts relate. If responding to one text, you probably should connect the text to overarching concepts and themes you have discussed in the class.\nThe same assignment may also be given to films, lectures, field trips, labs, or even class discussions.A reaction paper is not a summary of the text. It also does not state, \"I liked this book because it was interesting\" or \"I hated this because it was boring.\";\n, Before beginning your paper, you must figure out exactly what your teacher or professor is looking for. Some teachers want you to react by analyzing or evaluating the reading. Other teachers want a personal response. Make sure you understand which kind of reaction the assignment calls for.\n\n\nIf you are unsure, ask the teacher to clarify what they expect from the assignment.\nYou may be asked to react to the text in light of another text. If this is the case, you will want to use quotations from both texts in your writing.\nYou may be asked to react to the text in the light of the class themes. For example, if you read a book in a Sociology of Gender Roles class, you will want to read, annotate, and react based on how gender roles are described in the book.\nYou may be asked to react personally to the text. This is less common, but occasionally the teacher simply wants to know if you have read the text and thought about it. In this case, you should focus on your opinions of the book.\n To complete a reaction paper, you don't just read, give your opinion, and turn in the paper. A reaction paper synthesizes the texts, which means you take the information you read and bring it together so you can analyze and evaluate. You have to give yourself time to do the readings, but more importantly, to digest what you've read so you can put the ideas together.One of the biggest mistakes that students make is waiting until the last minute to read and react. A reaction is a thoughtful consideration after reading and rereading several times.\nYou may need to reread the text multiple times. First, to read and familiarize yourself with the text, then again to start thinking about the assignment and your reactions.\n After you read through the first time, jot down your initial reactions to the text. Do the same thing on any subsequent readings.\n\n\nTry completing some of the following sentences after you read: I think that..., I see that..., I feel that..., It seems that..., or In my opinion..., As you read through the text again, annotate it. Annotating in the margins of the text allows you to easily locate quotations, plot lines, character development, or reactions to the text. If you fail to annotate thoroughly, it will be more difficult to create a cohesive reaction paper.\n As you read the text, you have to start questioning the text. This is where your evaluation of the material and your reaction begins. Some questions to consider include:\n\n\nWhat issues or problems does the author address?\nWhat is the author's main point?\nWhat points or assumptions does the author make, and how does she back that up?\nWhat are strengths and weaknesses? Where are problems with the argument?\nHow do the texts relate? (if multiple texts)\nHow do these ideas connect to the overall ideas of the class/unit/etc?, Start by freewriting your reactions and evaluations of the author's ideas. Try to put into words what you think the author is trying to do and whether you agree or disagree. Then ask yourself why, and explain why you think these things. Freewriting is a great way to start getting your ideas on paper and getting past that initial writer's block.When you finish, read back over what you've just written. Determine what your strongest and most convincing reactions are. Prioritize your points.\n Reaction papers have to be critical and have some evaluation of the text. Otherwise, you are just summarizing what you read. After freewriting, decide what your angle is. Keep asking yourself the same questions as you craft a coherent reaction.\n\n\nThink about why the author has written the article or story as they have. Why did he structure things in this particular way? How does this relate to the outside world?, Now that you have completed your freewriting and found your angle, you can now shape this into an argument. What interesting thing do you have to say about what you just read? Start to state why what you said is interesting and important. This is the core of your reaction paper. Take all your points, opinions, and observations, and combine them into one claim that you will prove. This is your thesis.\n\n\nYour thesis will be one statement that explains what you will analyze, criticize, or try to prove about the text. It will force your reaction paper to remain focused.\n Your paper should follow basic essay format. It needs an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Each body paragraph should directly support your thesis. In each body paragraph, you should be reacting to a different portion of the text. Organize your reactions together into a few common topics so you can write them into paragraphs.\n\n\nFor example, if you are reacting to a theme in a book, you can split the paragraphs into how the setting, antagonist, and figurative imagery communicate the themes successfully or unsuccessfully.\n After you organize your ideas into paragraphs, you need to find quotations that will support your points. You must back up your claims with evidence from the text. Look at your annotations for quotations that support your thesis.\n\n\nDraft paragraphs that introduce quotations, analyze them, and comment on them., Your paragraphs should always start with a topic sentence. Then you have to decide how to structure your paragraph. You can start with what the author says and follow that with your reaction. Or you can start with the author and then follow with how your reaction contrasts. You generally want to start with what the author says first and follow it with your reaction.A good way to think about structuring your paragraph is: detail, example/quotation, commentary/evaluation, repeat.\n Make sure your introductory paragraph states the name of the text, the author, and the focus of your paper. You may also want to include the year of publication and the publication it was taken from if relevant. It is also good to include the topic of the text and the author's purpose.\n\n\nThe last sentence of your introduction should be your thesis.\n Although most reaction papers don't ask specifically for your personal opinion, you should be critiquing, analyzing, and evaluating the text, rather than just sticking to the facts.\n\n\nLook for places where you simply report what the texts says instead of providing a critique or evaluation of what the text says.\n One good way to analyze and evaluate the text is to connect it to other ideas you've discussed in the class. How does this text compare to other texts, authors, themes, or time periods?\n\n\nIf you have been asked to give a statement about your personal opinion, the conclusion may be the best place to insert it. Some teachers may allow you to state the personal opinions in the body paragraphs. Make sure to double check with the teacher first.\n Since reaction papers are usually short, you don't want them to be long. They can range from 500 words to 5 pages. Make sure to read your assignment carefully to make sure you follow directions.\n\n\nRead through for clarity. Are your sentences clear? Have you supported and fully argued your points? Is there any place where you're confusing?\n\n, Proof by reading for grammar errors. Look for run ons, fragments, verb tense issues, and punctuation errors. Check for spelling.\n Double check your assignment guidelines. Make sure you have followed your teacher's directions. If you did, it is ready to submit.\n\n"}

Your doctor will be able to address any potential neurological conditions, medical conditions, or responses to a new medication that could be contributing to the change. Your doctor may recommend that you try behavioral modifications such as relaxation, stress reduction, caffeine or alcohol avoidance, and better sleep habits, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy. Additionally, they may prescribe medication that may help or provide you with a referral to a mental health professional.Say:\n\n\n\u201dI'm experiencing a lot of fear and anxiety.

Anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications, and beta-blockers can all help alleviate the symptoms of your anxiety and fear. While you will still need to work on your issues, the medication can help., Phobias are valid and legitimate fears. They can, however, be seen as not rational.Due to a phobia being an irrational experience, it would not be successful or even possible to talk yourself out of it alone.A mental health professional, such as a counselor or a psychotherapist, will be able to help you along this process. Make an appointment with a mental health professional to discuss the following possible treatments.\n\n\nConsider Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is a type of psychotherapy that helps people change the way that they think, behave, and react to certain situations. This includes anxiety-inducing situations. CBT can also help you develop your social skills if you have social anxiety.Try talk therapy.Depending on the extent of your anthropophobia, you may benefit from talk therapy, where you work through your fears by talking with a therapist about them.\nExplore exposure or systematic desensitization therapy.These therapies focus on a gradual exposure to situations which cause anxiety, in order to practice relaxation and calming techniques until you no longer experience the anxiety.\nWork with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy or morita therapy.

As an employee, you also want to feel like you are working for an ethical employer. So when you are asked ethical questions during your interview, this is a good sign that your employer cares about your morals and values as an employee.In an interview for medical school, you will likely be asked ethical questions as a way to determine if you have sound ethical decision making. This is an essential element of being a good and responsible physician, especially in situations of life and death.;\n, Before you head to your job interview, you should prepare for ethical interview questions by reviewing several common questions used by potential employers, including:What would you do if someone in management asked you to do something unethical?\nTell me about a time you faced an ethical dilemma.\nIf you saw a coworker doing something dishonest, what would you do?\nIf you knew that your supervisor was doing something unethical, what would you do?\n\n, The process for getting into medical school usually involves an in person interview, where you will be asked several ethically based questions, including:You observe a fellow medical student cheating on an examination. What would you do?\nHow would you tell a patient just diagnosed with cancer that he has only a few weeks to live?\nWould you get out of your car to help a victim after observing an accident?\nWhat are your thoughts on euthanasia?\nA pregnant 15-year-old unmarried teenager comes into your office asking for an abortion. What would you do? Would you inform her parents?\n\n, One of the golden rules of answering ethical questions in a medical school interview is to always focus on how you can put your patient\u2019s needs first. You should place the patient\u2019s welfare above all else, as your role as a physician is to serve your patients, first and foremost.\n\nFor example, to answer the ethical question in a medical school interview: What are your thoughts on euthanasia?, you may consider how you can put the needs of a patient on life support first. If the patient is suffering unduly and there is no medical way to save her life, you may advocate for the use of euthanasia, as this will be in the best interests of the patient. As well, if the patient specified that she wanted to be euthanized once her health deteriorated to a certain point, you have an ethical obligation to fulfill her wishes, especially when there is nothing more you can do to save her life as her physician.\n When answering ethical questions in a job interview, you should try to put the needs of your employer first, where you are not putting your employer at risk in any way.To answer the ethical question in a job interview: If you saw a coworker doing something dishonest, what would you do?, you may consider how the coworker\u2019s actions puts your employer at risk. You may then respond by noting that the coworker is putting himself, the company, and other employees at risk, as his actions affect the ethics of everyone around him. As a result, you would confront him about his dishonesty and report him to your supervisor so he is held accountable for his actions.\n The interviewers are asking you ethical questions to test your ability to act with integrity and honesty. Your responses should reflect the importance of these attributes in your decision making and how much you value them.For example, if you are answering the question: If you knew that your supervisor was doing something unethical, what would you do?, you may think about how the supervisor\u2019s actions conflict with your ability to act with integrity and honesty. You may respond by noting that the supervisor was not acting with integrity or honesty, which is very important to you. To resolve the situation, you would confront your supervisor and report her to her supervisor or to the Human Resources department. This will ensure that your workplace remains honest and ethical.\nIf you are answering the question:You observe a fellow medical student cheating on an examination. What would you do?, you may note that your peer\u2019s actions do not reflect your values of integrity and honesty. To resolve the situation, you would confront your peer and report her to the medical school. This will ensure the examination remains honest and ethical, and that you can act as an honest person moving forward in the examination process.\n Often, using examples to support your response to an ethical question can show the interviewer how you can put your ethics into action in a specific situation. You should prepare one to two strong examples that explore an ethical dilemma and your response to it.For example, you may receive a more open ended question such as: Tell me about a time you faced an ethical dilemma. You can respond by using a situation where you discovered a colleague was cutting corners on a group project, leading to nearly missing the client deadline. You may note that you waited for the project to be handed in and then confronted your colleague by expressing your disappointment and frustration with their unethical handling of the project. You may then suggest that your colleague speak to your supervisor to discuss how and why he cut corners, as this could put you, the team, and the company in jeopardy. If your colleague refuses to do this, you may decide to talk to your supervisor yourself.\nThis response shows that you are trying to stay true to your ethics and show your colleague the courtesy of speaking to her one on one. By giving her the option to speak to your supervisor herself, you are extending trust to your colleague. It also shows you are willing to try to work out the issue among you and your colleague first, before going to your supervisor.\n It can be helpful to write down your response on a piece of paper or on your computer and then read it out loud to yourself to ensure it flows and makes sense. This will allow you to better prepare for the actual interview, as you will have a lower risk of babbling and long winded responses if you write down your thoughts first.\n\n\nYou can recite your response to yourself in front of a mirror so you can gauge your body language and your eye contact. You should have relaxed body language with your arms at your sides and your body facing forward. You should also maintain eye contact, and display happy facial expressions, like smiling or laughing.\n You can practice your responses to ethical questions by having a friend pretend to be your interviewer. Have a friend or peer ask you a series of ethical questions to determine how well you can respond to each question naturally, but concisely.\n\n\nYou should try to respond to the questions from memory, so you may need to memorize some of your written answers. You should also be willing to get feedback on your responses from your friend or peer and adjust your responses based on their feedback.\n\n"}

Bougainvillea needs at least 5 hours of full sun every day to thrive.\n Bougainvillea won't do well in soil that retains too much water, so make sure the soil drains quite well. They need rich soil that is slightly acidic, with pH between 5.5 and 6.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd limestone to the soil to increase the pH or sulphur to decrease the pH as necessary.\nIf you're planting the bougainvillea in a pot, choose a soil mix with the appropriate pH level.\n Dig a hole as deep as the bougainvillea plant's root ball. Add a high-phosphate fertilizer to the hole to promote root growth and help the flowers bloom. Lift the bougainvillea plant from its container and wet the root ball into the hole. Lightly pat the soil around the base of the plant.\n\n\nIf you want the bougainvillea to climb a trellis or wall, be sure to plant it near the structure. As it grows, you'll need to \"train\" it to climb the structure by wrapping it gently around the base.\nIf you're planting the bougainvillea in a container, make sure to choose one with plenty of drainage holes, since bougainvillea hate to have \"wet feet.\"\n\n"}

Coughing can aggravate these conditions.\n Your doctor may refer you to an ENT specialist, who can check your throat for signs of viral or bacterial infection, or if other underlying causes. An ENT specialist can also perform a nasal endoscopy using a fiber optic scope to look at your sinuses. The ENT specialist will look for nasal polyps and vocal cord polyps. The ENT specialist will also identify structural problems if you have nasal infection, and may suggest an endoscopic sinus surgery.You should tell your doctor about any other respiratory conditions you may have.\n Your doctor may recommend getting a 15-minute chest x-ray exam if you have symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, chronic cough, or fever. A chest x-ray is a painless, non-invasive test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Although a routine chest X-ray won't reveal the most common reasons for a cough, like postnasal drip, acid reflux or asthma, it may be used to check for lung cancer and pneumonia and other lung diseases.

The fabrics don't have to \"match,\" exactly, but it helps if they each share one or two colors.\nTry a festive pillowcase with fabrics in holiday colors or patterns. Holiday pillow cases make excellent gifts.\n Use a scissors or rotary cutter to carefully cut each piece of fabric to the right size. To make a standard pillowcase, cut the main piece of fabric to 26\" x 44\". Cut the second piece of fabric to 12\" x 44\". Cut the last piece of fabric for the trim to 2\" x 44\".\n To prepare the fabric to be sewn, use an iron to remove the wrinkles. Iron the large piece and the medium piece flat. Fold the trim in half lengthwise with wrong sides together and iron it flat.\n Place the medium piece of fabric right side up on your work surface. Line up the trim fabric with the edge of the medium fabric, so that the raw edges are on the outside and the folded edge is on the inside.

But if you want to give your sexual partner a special striptease, choose your clothing and location in advance. Wear lacy or semi-transparent undergarments, stockings with garters, and a couple layers of sexy, easy-to-remove clothing over this. Consider placing one chair for your partner to sit in, and one for yourself to use during the performance.\n\n\nPutting on music might help you find a rhythm, especially if you feel self-conscious or awkward.;\n, Make the most of it by standing directly in front of your partner with your legs apart, your weight slightly over one leg. Maintain eye contact as you deliberately undo the buttons.\n Don't be in a rush to get naked; the \"tease\" part of a striptease will get your partner excited. Tell your partner to stay seated on a chair, and walk around the chair showing off your body from the front, back, and sides. Tug at the straps on your dress or bra, or the buttons on your shirt, as though you are about to take them off any second.Get creative with your own sexy poses, or include these:\n\n\nIf you're wearing a low-cut shirt, bend forward over your partner briefly.\nFace away from your partner and bend forward over a chair or bed.\nTouch your partner's crotch briefly, then pull away.\nSit on a chair and slowly part your legs while giving your partner a sexy smile.\nGrab and stroke yourself around your breasts, crotch, or any body part your partner finds sexy.\n Either stand with your legs together in a feminine stance with one ball on the foot knee pointing in, or go for a stronger stance with your legs sexily spread apart with your weight slightly to one side. Cross your arms across your chest and suck your stomach in as you lift your hands up over your head.\n\n\nIf you have long hair, shake your head and let your hair flow out as you do this.\n Button-up shirts are perfect for stripping, since you can turn each button into its own mini-performance. Try leaving a couple buttons at the top and bottom undone in advance to make the outfit sexier. Remove the buttons slowly, one by one, as you continue to move around and pose. Once all the buttons are undone, slip the shirt down low over your shoulders, turn your back to your partner, and let the shirt fall to the floor.Unbutton the cuffs first, or undo them in advance before you enter the room.\nYou can sex this up a bit by only using one hand while having the other on your hip. Practice this in advance if you're going to try it.\n Keep teasing your partner between items of clothing, or ask \"are you ready for more?\" a few times before giving in. Lower the straps of your negligee or similar loose item of clothing over your shoulders and let it fall, or shimmy it down to the floor.\n A zippered skirt is great for beginners, since you can remove it easily and unexpectedly while striking almost any pose. A short, clingy skirt is another good option, and can be pulled up to reveal your butt before shimmying it off., You might want to practice this one in advance, since tight jeans tend to be less sexy when you're falling over with your legs trapped. Try kneeling, then pushing your jeans down to your knees while you stick your butt out at your partner. Sit back on your butt to pull the jeans off the rest of the way., You might want to leave your stockings on, especially with a sexy garter belt. On the other hand, a simple pair of nylon stockings can be a great prop. Put your leg up on a chair and roll them off slowly, then snapping it away slingshot style, or pretend to tie your wrists together. These are great visuals and good methods for adding a bit of cheeky humour to the mood.If you can walk around and pose gracefully with heels, you could leave them on as well as the stockings.\nTry wearing a pair of stockings one size too large, with a garter belt to keep them on. This gives you more freedom of movement during your striptease., Tug at the straps of your bra throughout the striptease, to get your partner excited. When you're finally ready to remove it, turn your back to your partner, and unhook the bra. Let it drop to your floor, then turn around to reveal your breasts., If you have an opportunity to prepare in advance, pick a sexy pair or lacy panties or a thong, but don't pick something so tight that it leaves marks.Try slipping them off while standing with your legs straight, or lay on your back and pull them up to your feet, where you can flick them off.\n\n\nIf you're wearing a sexy garter belt, wear your panties over it, so you can keep your garter belt on.\n\n"}

Vacuuming up the debris is a good solution; however, regular vacuum cleaners aren\u2019t recommended for use with electrical devices because of the electrostatic discharge that can affect you and your computer. Instead, purchase an anti-static vacuum cleaner to suck up all the gross stuff that accumulates in your mechanical keyboard.This will help your keyboard stay cleaner for longer since you are actually eliminating the dust, rather than just blowing it around.\n Most mechanical keyboards come with a warranty from the manufacturer. Many cleaning options \u2013 like running it through the dishwasher or removing and lubricating the keycaps \u2013 may void your warranty. Check what the warranty says before proceeding because you don\u2019t want to ruin it.Follow any cleaning instructions in the user\u2019s manual and consider contacting the manufacturer for a replacement if necessary.\n\n"}

It can happen anywhere in the insurance process pipeline from buying and using insurance to the acts of selling and underwriting the policies., The FBI estimates that the total costs of insurance fraud exceed $40 billion each year.Most of these costs are past along to consumers because insurance companies have to raise premiums on all policies in order to cover the losses incurred by fraudulent activity.\n\n\nThe FBI has calculated that this costs the typical U.S. household an additional $400 to $700 in increased premiums every year., One of the most common forms of insurance fraud, premium diversion is when insurance premiums are embezzled.Typically, premium diversion happens when an insurance agent collects premiums for personal gain without passing them along to the policy underwriter.This means the consumer believes he or she is paying the monthly premium without realizing that the money has been diverted.\n\n\nAnother form of premium diversion comes when an unlicensed individual sells fake policies and collects the premiums without any intention of ever paying claims.Beware of policies with significantly lower rates than any other competitors since this is a tactic used to draw in consumers., Consumer insurance fraud comes in a wide array of activities simply because of the different varieties of insurance available to consumers. Most people picture the intentional staging of accidents, injuries, arson, thefts, or other losses covered by a policy.While these instances absolutely constitute insurance fraud, other less-extreme examples include:\n\nExaggerating a legitimate claim for personal gain, such as the extent of an injury to claim disability.\nDeliberately providing false information or leaving out true information on a policy application, such as lying about a terminal illness on a life insurance application.\nWhether the insurance is medical, life, disability, auto, homeowners, or even crop insurance for farmers, you can find examples of these various types of consumer insurance fraud across the whole spectrum of insurance types available.\n Claims adjusters review insurance claims on behalf of companies or individuals to determine that actual liability of the insurance company on a given claim. Fraudulent adjusters can collect a fee to review your claim without any intention of following up, refer your repairs to unlicensed or poor contractors, and falsify or inflate claims that go against your insurance policy.Each of these examples constitutes insurance fraud.\n\n\nWhile consumer fraud most commonly defrauds the actual insurance company, adjuster fraud can cost consumers, insurance companies, or both.\n\n"}

A standard boxy fish tank will not do. This is because jellyfish need slowly circulating water. A kreisel or pseudokreisel design accomplishes this by creating a current that runs in a circle around the top, bottom, and sides of the tank.\nYou should have at least two gallons of water per jellyfish. In other words, if you have three jellyfish, your tank should be no smaller than six gallons.\nConsult a pet shop proprietor or marine life expert if you are unsure of what kind of tank you need.;\n, Slightly higher temperatures (up to 75 degrees Fahrenheit) may improve the growth rate of your jellyfish. Water temperatures can dip to around 60 degrees Fahrenheit without adversely affecting your jellyfish.Some species of moon jellyfish can tolerate temperatures up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.Always consult your vet or a marine expert to ensure you keep your particular jellyfish species at an appropriate temperature.\nPut a waterproof thermometer in your jellyfish tank. Monitor the temperature regularly. If your tank is too cold, you could place a heat lamp near the outside of the tank to raise the temperature, or try simply raising the temperature of your home thermostat.\nIf your jellyfish habitat is too hot, consider moving the tank to a cooler location like a basement, or invest in an aquarium cooler., Nitrifying bacteria are an important part of your jellyfish tank. In their natural environment, jellyfish would be surrounded by nitrifying bacteria (microorganisms that consume ammonia and turn it into nitrite and nitrate).There are many kinds of nitrifying bacteria available. Jellyfish tanks should be given nitrifying bacteria appropriate for saltwater.Nitrifying bacteria are common in many aquarium setups, and can be purchased from your local pet store.\n Jellyfish should be kept in water with a salinity of at least 28-30 parts per thousand and a maximum level or around 32-34 parts per thousand.Use a hydrometer to measure the water\u2019s salinity, and ensure that when you change the water, it is at an appropriate salinity level.\n\n\nHydrometers are readily available at pet stores and online.\nIntroduce your jellyfish to a tank with a salinity level that is slightly higher than normal. This way, they have a better chance at floating. You can gradually reduce the salinity over time. Water with a salinity level that is too low will make them sink.\nIf you need to adjust the salinity, remove your jellyfish from the tank and place them in a smaller quarantine tank. Dump the main tank out and mix a new batch of water at the correct salinity. Connect your pump to ensure the water mixes well for about 24 hours. Check the water in your hydrometer. Repeat as needed.\nDo not use tap water to create saltwater for your tank. Buy deionized or reverse osmosis water from your grocery store, and add Jelly Salt (a salt specifically designed for jellyfish habitats) in an appropriate amount., They can be fed a mix of dry, frozen, and live foods. Live rotifers, for instance, are a good jellyfish\u00a0snack. Jellyfish also enjoy eating baby brine shrimp.Commercially available jellyfish foods might be available at your local pet store or online.\n\n\nOne half to one full scoop of commercial jellyfish food is usually enough.Check manufacturer directions for specific use directions.\nWhen feeding your jellyfish shrimp or other live food, add a small amount (one tablespoon\u2019s worth) at first, then add more gradually over time. If you notice a surplus of shrimp in the tank after feeding, reduce the amount of live food you\u2019re feeding your jellyfish. It should get only as much food as it can eat in an hour.\nDo not pour water from baby brine shrimp tanks into your jellyfish tank.\n\n"}

Forcing turn-out can cause many injuries. Even some professional dancers do not have perfect turn-out after years of practice. In addition to each position having a different foot placement, each position also utilizes a different arm placement or port de bras.You can read more information on the different ballet positions at How to Do All Five Ballet Positions.;\n, Though you can perform a demi-pli\u00e9 in any of the five positions, use the first position for initial practice. First position requires the heels be placed touching (or close to it) with your legs turned out as close to 180 degrees as you can manage.\n\n\nYou also want to have your legs and back straight.The turn-out should come mostly from the leg at the hip joint. Do not place excess strain on the knees or ankles by forcing each foot closer to 90 degrees than you can do normally. Use your muscles to keep your knees over the feet rather than the two being out of alignment.Initially your turn-out in first position will look more like a V than a straight line. A wider turn-out simply comes with practice.\n Your upper body should remain in the same position\u2014shoulders down, head up, bottom tucked\u2014throughout the movement.One of the most common problems with pli\u00e9 form for beginners is due to sticking out one\u2019s butt while lowering as though lowering into a crouch. Don\u2019t stick your backside out or adjust your hips, simply lower at the knees while keeping the rest of the body straight., Demi-pli\u00e9s regardless of the beginning position require the heels to stay firmly planted on the ground.Do not bend so far that it forces your heels to come off the ground.\n\n\nRather than a deep bend, which is the territory of a grand-pli\u00e9, you only want to bend your knees until they extend just over your toes.\n While ballet dancers do rise quickly out of pli\u00e9s and use them as springboards for jumps and pirouettes, beginners should practice rising slowly and fluidly to help perfect the form. Rather than simply straightening your knees, you want to push your weight straight down into the floor with your legs and feet to push yourself back up.Using the legs and feet gives the motion much more fluidity, and it also places less strain on the knees.\nContinue keeping your shoulders down, head up, and bottom tucked during the upward movement. The motion should look more like the upper body is elevating rather than standing up since the upper body should already be straight., To finish the demi-pli\u00e9, you will continue rising until the thighs and knees and back together. You will return to first position the same as you were in before performing the demi-pli\u00e9.\n Once you feel comfortable with the basics of a demi-pli\u00e9 in first position, you can try pli\u00e9s from the other four ballet positions as well. They are harder, particularly in fifth position, so have patience and practice without rushing yourself.\n\n"}

They make use of a rounded tip that allows oil-based ink to go on smooth and dry quickly. Ballpoint pens are basic, inexpensive and easy to purchase in large quantities. For most purposes, a ballpoint pen will work just fine.The best selling point of ballpoint pens is their low price. You can buy a large bag of disposable ballpoint pens for just a few dollars.\nThe oil-based ink in ball point pens can congeal and collect dust over time, causing it form gummy globs around the tip.;\n, Rollerball pens are similar to ballpoints, but the ink they deliver is water-based, so it transfers to the paper quickly and forms sharp, dark lines. These tend to be fitted with a smaller tip. Their liquid ink is stored in an internal reservoir. Many business professionals favor rollerball pens because they combine the thin lines and precision of a traditional fountain pen with the practicality of a ballpoint.Having a finer tip produces thinner lines, which means your writing will look neater.\nRollerball pens can leak easily when they\u2019re put in your pocket, held upside down too long or exposed to changes in pressure. If you\u2019re not careful, the ink might ruin your clothes., Gel ink pens take their name from the thick fluid that they use to write. This type of ink creates extremely smooth, dark lines and allows for an even more effortless feel than ballpoint pens. Gel ink became popular as an alternative to scratchy, fine-tipped ink pens in the late 90s.Gel ink pens are usually refillable, and tend to be slightly more expensive than garden variety ballpoint pens.\nOne trade-off of gel inks ability to write in thick, smooth lines is that the ink dries very slowly. The gel sits on the surface of the paper momentarily before setting in. This makes it more likely to smudge and make a mess., Fountain pens were among the first types of pens invented and are still considered by many to be the best. They are called \u201cfountain\u201d pens because of the way the ink flows from an internal storage reservoir out through the tip when you write. The ink used in a fountain pens is dark and dries quickly, and the lines they produce are the thinnest and longest-lasting.Fountain pens are extremely customizable. They can be fitted with nibs (tips) of different thicknesses and refilled with inks of various colors. It\u2019s also possible to vary the thickness of a line while writing with a fountain pen, as the shape of the nib allows for different angles of pressure.The biggest disadvantage of using a fountain pen is their tendency to leak, due to the way the ink is stored and transferred. They can also be somewhat difficult to learn how to write with.\n Felt tip pens ride the line between traditional ink pens and markers. They make use of a spongy fabric tip to deliver dark (and usually permanent) ink that sets into the paper very quickly. Their tips come in a couple different sizes, the thinnest of which is best suited for most writing tasks, while thicker tips are often used for art, construction and crafting projects where large, bold, legible writing is a necessity. The conical shape of the tip allows the writer to form thin lines using the point, or bold, tapering strokes by brushing with one side.Felt tip pens may not be your go-to choice for a writing utensil, but they can come in handy if you're writing on an unusual surface or jotting down something you want to make sure will be seen.\nThe watery ink in a felt tip pen has a tendency to run and bleed on thinner paper types. If you need to do some fine precision writing, such as signing your name, you may want to look elsewhere.\n Sometimes you might opt for quantity over quality, especially if you only need a basic pen for occasional writing tasks. If this is the case, run down to your local convenience store and snag a package of non-refillable ballpoint pens for a couple bucks. You\u2019ll have a supply that will get the job done and last you for months (or possible even years, assuming the ink doesn\u2019t dry out), so you won\u2019t have to worry about running out of pens for a long time.\n\n\nA package of 60 Bic Stic ballpoint pens can be purchased for less than $5. Inexpensive pens like this will be a no-brainer to people who aren\u2019t looking to spend a lot on writing utensils.\nWhat these sort of pens lack in sophistication, they make up for in sheer availability.\n If you do a lot of writing, make comfort a priority in picking the right pen for you. Many pen styles these days offer ergonomic designs and cushioned gripping surfaces. These features will be a benefit if you frequently spend hours signing, scribbling and outlining.Try out different pens and see what feels the best. Pay attention to things like weight, the width of the body and how well it conforms to your hand.\nIf you happen to use a pen you like while you\u2019re out somewhere, make a note of what brand and model it is.\n Find an ink that looks good and serves your needs. People who like writing thick, smooth lines will do well with a quality ballpoint or gel ink pen. If you prefer the control and neat appearance of thin, sharp lines, go for a rollerball or fountain pen. Choosing an ink is mostly a matter of preference, as they each have distinct advantages and disadvantages.The biggest factors in deciding on an ink are how smoothly it transfers to the writing surface, how bold the color is and how likely it is to run, smear or bleed.\n If you plan on using the pen for a specific purpose, such as signing your name legibly on important documents or inking a drawing, look for a pen that will best serve that purpose. Artists will want to use fountain pens, since they offer the widest range of nip sizes and can be filled with almost any type of ink. Scientists, executives and students will likely gravitate toward pens that are easy to carry and deliver ink efficiently. Those with arthritis might benefit from writing with wider pens that are less painful to grip.People who are left handed should think about using pens that are filled with quick-drying inks, since they\u2019ll be less prone to smudging if a hand is run over them., To spare yourself expense in the long run, give pens with refillable ink a shot. Fountain pens can be reloaded with various types of ink, and most fancier gel and ballpoint pens can be disassembled when you need to change out an old stick. It\u2019s much cheaper to pick up some replacement ink sticks or cartridges than it is to buy brand new pens every time you run out.Keep a stash of refill bottles, sticks or cartridges in your home, office or locker so that you\u2019ll always have fresh ink when you need it.\nYou can even get ink refills in unique colors, giving you the option of switching to blue, green, orange, purple or red ink if your work requires a lot of color-coding or you just get bored with plain black.\n Once you\u2019ve found a pen you really like, get enough to last you awhile. Certain brands make their pens available by the bag, box or even case, perfect for people who are particular about what they use. Stockpiling pens will ensure that you have a constant supply, and save you the trouble of shopping for new pens regularly.\n\n\nVisit wholesale stores for deals on bulk packages of your favorite pens, or order them online.\nOlder models of pens are frequently discontinued as new ones are released. If you\u2019re partial to a particular pen, buy up as many as you can in case they disappear from the market later on.\n Assuming you have a little money to spend, do some research on top-quality specialty pens. Companies like Platinum, Waterman and Montblanc manufacture pens using flawless designs and durable materials, so they\u2019re guaranteed to last longer, leak less and always perform at peak level. If you weigh your options carefully, you might never have to buy another pen again.Get a protective case to go along with an expensive pen to protect it from damage.\n No matter what kind of ink pen you end up going with, put it away somewhere room temperature and out of the way when you\u2019re not using it. Store spares or refills together with your pens in the same drawer or in a nearby supply stash. Make sure the caps are secured and the pens are laid flat or arranged in an upright container to cut down on the chances of a leak.Keep track of where you leave your pens so that you don\u2019t lose them.\nCheck your pockets for pens before you wash and dry them. Forgetting a pen when you do the laundry is a surefire way to ruin your clothes.\n\n"}

Even when you do ask, the information you are given may be incomplete.\nYou may want to keep the ICE website bookmarked on a work computer. You can find contact information for detention facilities and ICE field offices using the locator pages on the ICE website.\nTry to take down as much identification information as you can about the ICE officers who conducted the raid.\nThis information may be of use to your attorney in protecting your rights, especially if the ICE officers expanded their search beyond the scope of their warrant or harassed and intimidated you or your employees during the course of the raid.\n After being arrested, immigration detainees often are transferred to another location. They may be moved to a nearby jail, or to an ICE detention center in another part of the country.This is something you have to be on top of, because detainees can be transferred even within hours of being arrested.\nIf you call the detention center identified by the ICE officer and are told the person is not there, ask where they have been sent.\nKeep in mind that the detention officers may refuse to give you this information. Document the phone conversation and get the name and identification of the officer with whom you spoke. Contact your attorney for assistance with locating your detained employees.\n It's generally not a good idea to have your own attorney representing your detained employees. However, you can help them find an experienced immigration attorney.Your attorney may know of attorneys in your area that practice immigration law. Otherwise, you may want to find immigration attorneys using the searchable directory on your state or local bar association's website.\nThere also are nonprofit organizations that provide free and reduced-cost legal services to undocumented immigrants.\nYou may be able to find legal assistance for your detained employees by contacting these organizations.\nKeep in touch with the family of your detained employees so that you know what's happening and what you can do to help.\n When undocumented immigrants are detained, ICE typically sets a bond. Paying this amount allows the detained employee to be released pending their deportation proceedings.Bond is similar to bail in criminal cases. If you pay the bond for your detained employees, you'll get most or all of your money back provided they show up for court dates.\nContact the ICE detention center holding your detained employees and ask if bond has been set. If you are told bond has not yet been set, find out why.\nBond for detainees typically is several thousand dollars. You can work with their immigration attorneys and request a hearing to have this amount lowered.\nKeep in mind that in can take years for a detainee to stand before a judge. Paying the bond for your detained employees allows them to spend this time with their families rather than in a detention center.\n\n"}

Use a sharp knife to dice the tomatoes, onion, and squash. Put the onion in one prep bowl and place the other vegetables in a separate prep bowl. Trim the green beans into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces and put them in the bowl with the tomatoes and squash.You should also have a few cooked potatoes. If you didn't purchase them cut, dice them yourself. You'll need 2 cups (650 g) of diced cooked potatoes.;\n, Pour 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil into a large sauce pot or Dutch oven. Turn the heat to medium and add the diced onion. Stir the onion and cook it for about 6 minutes. Sprinkle 1 to 3 teaspoons of hot paprika over the sauteed onions and let it cook for another 30 seconds.Use more or less hot paprika depending on how spicy you want the vegetable soup.\n Open two 14-ounce (414 ml) cans of vegetable broth and pour them into the pot. Stir in the diced tomatoes, squash, cooked potatoes, and trimmed green beans.You can adjust the vegetables in this recipe according to your taste. For example, if you don't want the cooked potatoes, substitute mushrooms or carrots.\n Turn the heat to high, so the soup boils. Reduce the heat to medium and let it bubble gently. It should simmer for about 12 minutes. The vegetables will become tender.Stir the soup occasionally while it cooks and leave the lid off. This will help the soup thicken a little.\n Once the vegetables are tender, stir in 2 cups (142 g) of frozen spinach and 2 tablespoons of sherry or red-wine vinegar. The vinegar will give the soup a tangy taste. Let the soup keep cooking for a few more minutes, so it's completely heated.You could also add chopped fresh kale or chard instead of the frozen spinach.\n Pour the soup into your serving bowls and divide 1/4 cup (5 g) of chopped fresh basil among the bowls. If you don't have fresh basil, you could add about 1/2 teaspoon of purchased pesto to each bowl of soup.Serve the soup with crusty bread or crackers.\nStore the leftover soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two days.\n\n"}

This will make her more comfortable with the equipment, so she'll be less likely to run off or be frightened by it.\n\n\nGive your cat a chance to warm up to being photographed. Don't expect to immediately take amazing photographs. Your cat will probably be curious for a few minutes.;\n, Your cat probably won't simply sit still while you take her portrait. Instead, give her things to play with. Consider offering her new toys to play with. If you'd like to keep her in one spot, try setting up a new stationary toy like a cat tower or post.Try giving your cat a view of something interesting. For example, offer your cat a view out of a window and scatter bird seed outside. This way, she'll be entertained by birds eating.\n Treats like cat food treats or catnip can be great photography aids. Give your cat treats to reward good behavior, like sitting still for a minute. You can also give treats as a way to direct your cat's attention. For example, hold a treat near your head so your cat looks at you. This way, you can get a photo of your cat looking directly at the camera.You may want to ration out how many treats you want to give your cat before you begin taking pictures. This way, you don't accidentally give your cat too many treats throughout the session.\n You might get great shots right away or you may need to take a lot of photos just to get a good one. Be sure to give your cat plenty of time and space. Your cat will feel more relaxed if you remain relaxed instead of stressing about taking the perfect shot.Have fun photographing your cat. Consider setting up a tripod to automatically take photos. This way you could play with your cat and just let the camera capture the fun you're having together.\n Some cats will enjoy being photographed longer than others will. Pay attention to signs that your cat no longer wants to be the subject of your attention. If your cat seems distracted, gets angry (hisses, scratches), or tries to walk away, end the photo shoot. You probably won't get good photographs if your cat isn't cooperating, so try again later.\n\n\nNever force your cat into poses. These are often unnatural for cats and can lead to injury. Always consider the needs of your cat., Consider what kind of background to use when taking a photo. If you choose a background that's bright, detailed, or distracting, your cat will be competing for the focus of the shot. If you use this kind of a background, photograph only a bit of your cat (like her tail as she runs from the frame).\n\n\nFor a professional-style portrait, consider using a simple white backdrop or neutral sofa. This will make your cat the focus of the image.\nYou can keep the background natural by just photographing outside in the yard., You can add interest to a photograph by including props or other people. For example, you might photograph your cat playing with one of her favorite toys or snuggling with a member of the family. Other props might include a pile of leaves, a cozy blanket, or baskets.\n\n\nProps are a good way to let your cat's personality come through. If you have an energetic cat that's constantly moving, showing her playing with balls can illustrate that energy.\n Don't forget to really think about what your cat looks like and the challenges she presents. For example, if you have a black cat, you'll need to make sure that the background you select will contrast with her dark fur. Or, realize this and make the photograph dramatic by shooting against a black background.Likewise, if you're photographing a shy cat, but need to include other cats in the photograph, don't be surprised if the shy cat tries to run off or doesn't cooperate.\n If you can, photograph your cat in natural light. This way, you can avoid harsh artificial lighting. If you photograph outside, avoid bright direct light which can make difficult shadows. Instead, try to shoot around mid-morning when the light is a little softer.\n\n\nIf you have to shoot indoors, avoid using a flash.Your cat will probably blink and then learn to look away from the camera when you photograph her. Flash can also make your cat's eyes take on a bright red color.\n Since most cats move around quickly, you'll need to make sure your camera can keep up. Set a high shutter speed so that your image won't be blurry if your cat is playing or moving.You should also consider how sharp or blurry you want the background to be and adjust your f-stop accordingly (a higher f-stop will make for a sharper image, while the lower f-stop will create a shallower depth of field).\n While it's a good idea to go into the photo shoot with lots of flexibility, there may be a few images you know you want to get. Consider making a short list of images you really want to get. For example, you may want:\n\n\nA close up of your cat's paws or eyes\nAn image of your cat sleeping\nA photo of your cat grooming herself\nA photograph of your cat playing or doing a trick\n\n, As with any type of photography, you should choose a focal point when taking a picture. This could be some part of your cat or something behind your cat. For example, you could have a bright red background with your cat filling most of the frame. In this case, your cat is the focal point.\n\n\nIf you fill the frame with your cat, decide if you want to focus on some feature of your cat. For instance, you may do a close up of your cat's eyes or whiskers.\n It's easy to start taking photos by pointing the camera down at your cat. But, for a more interesting image, get on your cat's level.You'll be able to directly photograph your cat's face, which can be great for a close up.\n\n\nTo get on your cat's level, you can get down on the ground or try setting her on something elevated so she's nearer to your level. Always set your cat on a safe spot where she can't injure herself.\n Try shooting from a variety of places. You might start by photographing down at your cat while your cat looks up at you. Remember to shoot at your cat's level. But, you can also try raising your cat up while you get below her. This way, you can shoot up, with your cat looking down.\n\n\nThere's not one perfect angle for photographing cats, so try several. You won't know what angles work best until you try photographing from them., Taking posed cat portraits can be difficult, so start by letting your cat run around and play. Take candid action shots while she does this. It's a great way to let your cat's personality really shine.Make sure your shutter is set to a high speed so the image doesn't come out blurry.\n Since cats are unpredictable, be prepared to take a lot of photos. Don't wait for your cat to do something interesting, or you may lose your opportunity for a great photo. Instead, plan on taking a lot of pictures. This way, you're likely to get good shots and you'll have a lot of images to work with later if you'd like to edit them.\n\n\nIf you can, set your camera to burst mode so that when you press the shutter, the camera takes several images spaced over a second or two."}

Dogs are very sensitive to the body language and reactions of the humans around them, so it is important to control your breathing and remain composed.\n\n\nIf your dog is fighting, it is important to control your breathing to help you release any anxiety and fear. Steady your breathing by counting to 10 as you breathe in and out. Breathing deeply will help you control your emotions, help you remain calm, and may help put the dogs at ease, too.;\n, Do not try to separate the dogs with your hands, and do not wedge yourself in between them. This vulnerable position makes it easier for the dogs to accidentally bite or injure you. In addition, this interference could reroute the dog\u2019s aggression toward you., Try to divert the dogs\u2019 attention by making a loud noise. Hit a metal dish, smash pots together, blow a whistle, or create loud noises by dropping something on the floor like a heavy book. This distraction may be enough to distract the dogs and cause them to lose interest in fighting.\n\n\nIf the dog is fighting in the house, ring the doorbell. Many dogs are tuned into that sound, so your fighting dog\u2019s interest may be piqued when it hears the bell. It may leave the fight to go investigate the sound.If your dog gets into a fight while on a walk or in a dog park, rattle your car keys loudly to distract it., If you have multiple dogs that fight frequently, keep a spray bottle full of water on hand. When a fight does break out, remain at a safe distance and spray the dogs with the water. Being hit by a stream water may surprise the dogs and divert their attention away from the fight.If you are outdoors, spray your dogs with a hose if one is easily accessible.While on a walk or in a dog park, use the water from a water bottle or from a dog\u2019s water bowl to sidetrack the fight., If two people are present and the dogs have not ceased fighting, each person should carefully grab one of the dog\u2019s hind legs. Gently lift the legs off of the ground and walk backward a few steps. The dogs should halt the fighting at this point, but it is important to remove both dogs immediately., Once your dog has been properly secured on a leash, removed from the situation, and has had time to calm down, check it for any injuries. Any open wound is prone to infection. Look out for bleeding, swelling, limping, and difficulty breathing.Your dog should be examined by your veterinarian. Even a minor wound can cause serious problems for your dog\n\n\nUse pressure to stop any excessive bleeding, but do not use a tourniquet.\nDepending on the severity of the injuries, your veterinarian may prescribe antibiotics, pain medications, treatment with intravenous fluids, or even surgery., Some dogs may behave in an aggressive way due to a medical issue. Dogs with thyroid problems, orthopedic issues, epilepsy, or other cognitive issues may exhibit hostile behavior. Diet may even play a factor in a dog\u2019s aggressive tendencies. Be sure to talk to your veterinarian first about any potential underlying health issues.Let your doctor know if your dog has been having any health issues or changes coupled with signs of aggression. \u201cMy dog\u2019s hair has started thinning, and I have noticed that it is more prone to growling and snipping lately. Could this be a sign of something else?\u201d This information will help your veterinarian diagnose and treat your dog.\n Before your dog is one year old, be sure that it is neutered or spayed. This can help prevent male aggression and thwart fights caused by a female dog in heat. In addition, these procedures can help your dog live a longer, happier, and healthier life., Try to understand what is causing your dog to behave aggressively and try to remove that influencing factor. Evaluate the situation. Think about the dog\u2019s behavior prior to its most recent fight and search for clues or patterns that may help you identify what caused the outburst.\n\n\nSome dogs show aggression over their possessions, which means that they may guard or protect their food or their favorite toy. Try to remove the objects that your dog covets when other dogs are present, and organize to feed your dog by itself., Aggression problems are difficult to diagnose, and properly training a dog to behave a certain way can be very challenging for a pet owner. Look into hiring a professional animal behavior specialist to properly diagnose and treat your dog. A professional will come up with a comprehensive and personalized plan to help your dog, and the trainer may identify any quality-of-life problems that may be the cause of your dog\u2019s aggression.Talk to your veterinarian about hiring a professional trainer for your dog.\n When desensitizing a dog, you gradually introduce your pet to particular situation to pacify its fearful and hostile reactions. This technique must be done slowly and deliberately to be effective.With time and patience, your dog will begin to understand that it does not need to be violent around other dogs.\n\n\nFigure out how close you can bring your leashed dog to another dog without it showing signs of aggression. If your dog can watch another dog that is 50 feet away without barking or growling, then start at that distance. Gradually bring your dog closer to the other dog, provided that it does not begin to behave in a hostile manner., In conjunction with practicing desensitization, counter conditioning can help teach your dog a new response to a situation. When you provide your dog with a treat and praise each time it exhibits the desired behavior, your dog will begin to view the once scary situation as a positive one.When your dog gets closer and closer to another dog without barking, lunging, or exhibiting other aggressive behaviors, give it a treat and praise. With repeated attempts, your dog will begin to remain calm around other dogs with the hope of earning a tasty treat., Changes to your dog\u2019s behavior will be gradual, so it may take a long time before you notice significant changes. Don\u2019t be discouraged! Progressing too quickly will not be effective or helpful for your pet. Practice these techniques consistently, and keep a record of your day-to-day training sessions to notice your dog\u2019s incremental improvements.\n\n\nIf you are rewarding your dog for a particular behavior, such as giving it a treat each time it gets closer to other dogs without growling, be sure to consistently reward it on each occasion. An inconsistent rewards system may cause your dog to lose sight of the big picture and the lessons will be lost.\nBe on the lookout for small changes. Perhaps one day your dog will quietly growl at another dog in the dog park, and a few days later, your dog will wag its tail when it sees one. This small change shows that your dog is beginning to associate its good behavior with a reward, changing its overall perspective.\n\n"}

It should be free from fragrances and synthetic chemicals.Alternatively you can make your own dog shampoo by mixing together 1/3 cup glycerin, 1 cup mild dishwashing soap, 1 cup white vinegar, and 1 quart water. Put all these ingredients into a liter-sized bottle, and shake before each use., Frequent washing will dry out a Pittie\u2019s skin and deplete the natural oils in its coat. With their fine fur, most APBTs only need a couple baths per year. You should bathe your pet only when necessary and no more than every six weeks unless otherwise directed by a vet.If your dog gets dirty frequently, stick to rinsing off the mud with plain water rather than bathing it more often.\nYou can bathe your dog in a tub, shower, or outside using a hose with a gentle spray nozzle. Your pooch will be more likely to stay put if you wash it in a controlled or closed space using a comfortably warm water temperature.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to brush your Pittie ahead of time to remove any loose hair or dirt before it jumps in the bath.\n Wet and lather up your Pittie with dog shampoo from its neck down. Rinse your pooch with luke-warm water using a detachable shower head, pitchers of water, or a hose with a gentle spray nozzle.Don\u2019t soap up your pet\u2019s head to avoid getting water and shampoo in its ears and eyes.\nBe sure to rinse your APBT\u2019s coat thoroughly until the water runs clear so that there\u2019s no shampoo left to dry out its skin or tempt your pet into licking it.\n Once you\u2019ve given your dog a good rinse, let it shake off any excess water. Then, wrap your pet in a big, absorbent towel, and gently pat it dry.Do not let your dog out into cool weather until it has dried completely.

{"title": "How to Choose a Private Jet Charter Company", "summary": "identify the right charter broker or operator.\n\"there are a number of charter brokers who appear to have many aircraft but in reality are serving in a capacity similar to a travel agent.\",\ncharter brokers are not faa authorized and do not have any aircraft under their control.\nvalidate the charter company.\nvisit the company: this may not always be possible, but you will learn a tremendous amount of information about a company by meeting their people, seeing their facility, and touring a few aircraft.\nlook for good customer service: ideally, there should be a single person responsible for your trip.\nselect an aircraft: often, a charter company will provide pictures of an aircraft under consideration for a trip.\ncheck up on your pilot: find out what the provider's standards are for minimum pilot hours.\nfind out how much it will cost: as the details of your needs become more specific, you should be able to get a clear quote, not a vague estimate that leaves room for surprises on the final invoice.", "article": " Yes, one could check the local Yellow Pages or a favorite search engine to locate charter companies. However, there won\u2019t be any information about the quality of individual companies there, other than what is written in advertisements created by the companies themselves. Use the web to look for online directories of FAA authorized charter operators, charter brokers and their locations, and the various aircraft they offer.;\n, This statement is true. Brokers do not have operational control over any aircraft. They get quotes from operators, put their fee on top of that and retail it.\n If you like the idea of using a travel agent, keep in mind that a quality FAA authorized operator can access a jet anywhere in the world just like a broker. Now that you have a list of operators, their aircraft, and phone numbers, you need to ask a few basic questions.\n The next step is verifying the charter company\u2019s advertising claims through official documentation. In order to simplify this complicated task, one can break down the process into three categories: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documentation, insurance and third-party audits.\n\nFAA Documentation \u2013 Each charter company must have a valid Part 135 air taxi certificate which authorizes it to fly for hire. Obtaining a Part 135 certificate requires the charter company to adhere to FAA guidelines and is strictly enforced by the FAA. Ask for a copy of their \"Air Carrier Certificate\" which is the official document granted by the FAA. If a charter company does not have an air carrier certificate, they are not authorized by the FAA to conduct charter operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsurance \u2013 Often overlooked, insurance can provide a great deal of information about a charter company. Typical limits for a charter company are $50M-$100m for a small jet (such as a Cessna Citation, Lear 40 or Hawker 400XP), $100M for a mid-sized jet (such as a Hawker 800XP, Lear 60 or Citation XL) and $100M-$500M for a large jet (such as a Challenger, Gulfstream or Falcon). Often, these higher insurance limits require an audit by the insurance company to assure that the pilots and mechanics have the appropriate experience to operate a safe flight. Also, another free service most operators will offer is for the passenger to be \u201cnamed additional insured\u201d on the policy. This option is really a personal decision. It should be considered if the passenger flies private charter on an ongoing, regular basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird Party Audits \u2013 There are several companies that specialize in auditing charter companies. The industry\u2019s most used services are Aviation Research Group (ARG/US) or Wyvern. ARG/US & Wyvern compile several databases, including FAA, Department of Transportation (DOT) and one on aircraft transactions, to determine the safety records of the operator, its pilots and its aircraft. In addition, these companies will perform on-site audits on safety procedures, aircraft log books and additional documentation. The only way to verify that an operator has been audited by one of these organizations is to contact ARG/US or Wyvern directly.\n Viewing people and facilities will tell you a lot about the quality of aircraft and level of service you can expect from the charter company.\n Also, live help should be available around the clock for if you must change your plans, make a special request, or ask a question. You will get a great sense of their level of service by how you are treated on the phone. Does the agent take time with you, ask questions to ensure they understand what is important to you, are they polite, and most importantly, are they responsive.\n Be warned, however, that pictures are deceiving and may not be current. The only way absolutely ensure the status of an aircraft is to view it personally.Also, because insurance levels can change at any time and vary by aircraft within the same fleet, it is important to ask for a copy of the insurance policy before each and every flight.\n Different jet types require different pilot hours. Once you have chosen an aircraft, verify that the assigned pilot has the required number of pilot hours on that type of craft. Generally, each captain should have at least 5000 total flight hours and 300 hours in the specific aircraft type. Ask how often the pilots attend recurrent training in a full-motion simulator. Once every six months is considered ideal. Anything less, the pilot may not be as fresh as possible on the latest procedures.\n Any always ask for a hard quote. Yes, certain things such as catering, ground transportation, and flight phone usage are not known before the flight, but everything else should be a firm quote so you are not surprised by the final billing.\n\n"}

While babies are too young for most activities, you can encourage wakefulness during the day by talking to your baby, singing to your baby, and stimulating your baby with sounds, visual aids, and play., There are several reasons why getting outside with your baby is important, and one of them is that fresh air can clean out the lungs. It can also increase oxygen intake, and this will help your baby sleep more soundly.Another reason to get outside is that exposure to natural light will help your baby\u2019s internal clock regulate itself faster, meaning she\u2019ll adjust faster to sleeping through the night.If you can't get outside for play and activities, open the windows to allow some fresh air inside.\n While it may seem counterintuitive, making sure your baby gets enough sleep during the day will actually help her sleep better at night. The reason for this is that babies do need quite a bit of sleep each day, and restricting their daytime sleep will make them overtired, which will make it harder for them to fall asleep at night.To promote daytime sleep, you may have to use motion to help your baby nap. This could include using a swing or carrier, a car ride, or rocking., Recognize and look for signs of sleepiness throughout the day, and when you spot them, get your baby down for a nap as soon as possible! Again, this will ensure she gets enough sleep during the day, and isn't overtired when it comes time to go down for the night. Signs of tiredness include:Rubbing the eyes and tugging on the ears\nBecoming whiny and tearful\nBlank staring, stillness, and quietness\nYawning and stretching\n\n, The sleep and wake patterns of babies and newborns are governed by hunger, feeding, and digestion.Therefore, the fuller your baby is when she goes to sleep at night, the longer her food will take to digest, and the longer she\u2019ll sleep.\n\n\nIn the couple hours leading up to bedtime, start cluster feeding your baby by feeding her every hour, and then once again right before bed., Around 12 weeks, babies can begin to develop a regular circadian rhythm that\u2019s dictated by the cycle of night and day.This means early on in life, your baby can start getting used to a bedtime routine that will signal sleep is coming soon.\n\n\nYou can start with a bedtime routine around three months, and aim for between 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m.Soothing bedtime activities include a bath, cuddles, reading, and quiet music or singing., To help teach your baby how to soothe herself to sleep at bedtime and during the night, put her down in her crib or bed when she's drowsy but still awake. Lay her down on her back, and make sure the area is free of pillows, blankets, toys, and other objects.You can start allowing your baby to put herself to sleep around six to eight weeks of age., A pacifier could help your baby settle quicker and fall asleep faster, and there's also evidence suggesting that pacifiers can reduce the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome).You may have to stop using the pacifier, however, if the baby wakes and can't get back to sleep when she drops it., One of the worst culprits for a baby\u2019s disrupted sleep is the intense pain caused by teething. To help soothe her gums, try a gum massage with your finger, or talk to a doctor or pharmacist about an infant analgesic.Babies generally start teething between six and 10 months.\nSigns of teething include low grade fever, drooling, and red, swollen gums.\n As your baby adjusts to a night and day cycle, her body\u2019s hormones will become sensitive to light and dark. The same way that adults need darkness at night to produce melatonin and sleep properly, so too is your baby\u2019s body developing this same need.\n\n\nKeep your baby\u2019s room as dark as possible when it\u2019s time to sleep, and only use minimal lighting if you need to tend to her in the night.This will prevent her from waking fully, and will make it easier to get her back to sleep.\nDuring the day, don\u2019t try to darken the house when your baby naps, or her body could become confused., Babies who are put to sleep in rooms that are too warm may overheat quickly and not sleep well. Keep her room around 70 F (21 C) to promote a sound sleep., It may be inevitable that your baby wakes during the night, especially if she's still feeding every couple hours. However, you can make it easier to get her back to sleep by not rousing her into a wakeful state.\n\n\nWhen you go into her room at night, keep the lights dim, make as little noise as possible, don\u2019t make eye contact, and use calm movements and a quiet voice., When your baby does stir in the night, allow her to put herself back to sleep, if possible. Instead of rushing in when she stirs, wait a few moments before going to her. This will hopefully teach her to soothe herself back to sleep, which will be a useful ability throughout her entire life.You can start doing this with your baby once she\u2019s four to five months. If she doesn\u2019t settle herself after a couple minutes, then go to her.For babies who are six months and older, one method you can try is called the Ferber method. When your baby cries, go to her, give her a gentle pat, and then leave. Even if she continues to cry, wait five minutes before checking on her again and giving her another pat. Leave again, and next time wait 10 minutes before going to her. Continue increasing the amount of time between visits by five minutes., On the other end of the spectrum from Ferber\u2019s self-soothing method is the attachment parenting style, where parents use physical closeness to bond and promote sleep. While many experts do not recommend co-sleeping (sleeping in the same bed) for safety reasons,you can keep your baby\u2019s crib in the same room as yours.Along with helping you and baby bond, this will also ensure you\u2019re available immediately throughout the night, which could help your baby from becoming too awake if she needs something.\n If your baby is waking often in the night, there may be issues you can address that will make her more comfortable and keep her asleep longer. These could include:Wet diapers. If your baby wakes often because of a wet diaper, try a more absorbent nighttime diaper.\nSleepwear that\u2019s not comfortable. Allergies, dyes, and scratchy fabrics can all make babies uncomfortable, and this could stop yours from sleeping soundly. Try natural fibers like undyed cotton if you suspect this problem.\nEnvironmental irritants, such as dust, smoke, baby powder, and perfume can all cause congestion in a baby\u2019s sensitive breathing passages. Make sure your baby\u2019s room is clean and free of common irritants (such as plants, feathers, wool), if she often wakes with a stuffy nose.\n Sleep regressions are periods when a sleep-trained baby or toddler begins to wake frequently in the night again. These regressions can last anywhere from one to four weeks, and they often occur around four months, between eight and 12 months, at the 18-month mark, and the final one around two years of age. To manage sleep regressions, try:Providing extra food during the day or, rarely, at night. Sleep regressions can often be caused by growth spurts, during which time your baby\u2019s body needs extra fuel.\nOffering extra physical comfort, such as a few extra cuddles, pats, or kisses as your baby is getting ready for bed, or as your baby tries to get back to sleep in the night.\nGetting your baby to bed at an earlier hour. Because sleep regressions disrupt normal sleep patterns, they can cause your baby to become overtired, and this makes sleep even more elusive.\n Ongoing sleep problems may be a sign of a different problem that will need to be addressed to help your baby sleep more.\n\n"}

You are constantly excreting small amounts of sweat into your clothes, and this trapped liquid conducts cold air more efficiently, making you colder when the temperature drops at night.Keep dry sleeping clothes in a waterproof bag during the day, and air them out to thoroughly dry in the morning.;\n, No matter how chilly it gets at night, you\u2019ll still excrete some liquid from your skin into your dry sleeping clothes. Fabrics that hold in liquids rather than let them pass through will make you colder. Think of it this way \u2014 imagine hanging your washed laundry out to dry, and pick the clothes (and fabrics) that dry the fastest.\n\nWear wool and avoid cotton. Generally speaking, these are the best and worst materials for keeping you warm despite being wet., Wool is great for moisture-wicking, but that bulky, itchy sweater Grandma got you for Christmas may not make the best camping pajamas. Prioritize breathable comfort, and use layers that are easy to peel off if necessary \u2014 for instance, if you get too warm during the night, or need to get up to use the bathroom.You might layer up, for instance, a vest and underwear, baggy T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms, normal socks, night socks, and a large jumper. Or try the one piece \"onesie\" pajamas that are warm, versatile, and easy to pack. Just try to keep cotton layers from making direct contact with your skin.\n Some campers argue that sleeping \u201cin the buff\u201d with lots of layers surrounding you keeps you warmest. However, combining thin layers of breathable clothing with layers of blankets and covers is likely your best bet for staying toasty. It also makes it less chilly (and more discreet) if you need to get up during the night!\n\n\nThat said, it\u2019s better to sleep naked with lots of blankets if all of your clothes are wet.\n Nearly all sleeping bags now have ratings listed on the tag, indicating either a seasonal rating (three season, excluding winter, for instance) or a nighttime temperature range in which they can keep you warm. Don\u2019t take chances in cold weather; do your homework, talk to experts, and pick a bag that can handle the nighttime temperatures you\u2019ll be facing.Before departing on your camping trip, make sure your sleeping bag is in good condition \u2014 check for tears or holes, broken zippers or cinches, etc.\n The colder it is, the more layers you\u2019ll want to add. Place blankets, towels, rugs, mats, or even extra clothing on top of your bag. You can also buy zip-up fleece liners to place inside your bag, or even double-up with a thinner bag inside a thicker one."}

Too many people will be hard to keep happy, have fun, and you'll need more room to sleep and more food. Just invite some of your closest friends and try not to exclude anyone. You'll have more fun with people you really know, and you'll feel more comfortable, as well as them. You could invite just one friend, but usually, a small group is loads more fun. Anywhere from three to six friends is a good amount. Keep these things in mind before deciding who and who not to invite:\n\n\nTry inviting a girl you want to know better, making sure to be friendly towards her to make her feel welcome. This doesn't mean a total stranger, but maybe you came across a girl at school who loves, for example, Harry Potter. If you have a similar hobby or interest, you can do that at the sleepover while making a new friend. But, don't invite more than two people you don't know well. There could often be awkward silences, and you may make your closer friends left out.\nDon't invite the \"popular\" girl(s). Unless you are actually friends with them, inviting these girls is generally not a great idea. Just because she is popular doesn't mean you'll be all \"cool\". What will you even do? And anyway, what about your actual friends?;\n, You'll need dinner, dessert, breakfast, snacks, and drinks. Try buying the food only a couple days before, so you won't eat it all! You can also go out to eat ice cream, dinner, or breakfast (but not all three!). Try picking food that isn't very different, something that everyone will probably like. Don't get, for example, fish or veggie burgers. You can, however, have a choice of regular or veggie burgers. So, always have something that everyone will want to eat. Below are some simple suggestions for all the food and drinks you'll need. But, you can also think of your own!\n\nDinner-The most common dinner at a sleepover is pizza, which pretty much everyone likes. If you're getting pizza, always have at least one plain and one with a topping. (pepperoni always works). Other dinner choices are chicken, pasta, hot dogs and hamburgers. Know what your friends like, but if you don't know, just get pizza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDessert-For dessert, be creative! A great idea is to make dessert at the party, like ice cream sundaes, cupcakes, or a cake. You can just decorate them, or make them from scratch. Or, you can have a premade cake or brownies. It will save time if you want to do more activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrinks-Always have water and soda. Sprite is always good to get, but if your friends like Coke, 7 Up, Root Beer, etc., get those as well. Fruit juice is good, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast-For breakfast, make your own waffles or pancakes, or have a parent make them. You can also have french toast sticks. Always have some delicious fruit, and orange juice and milk to drink.\nSnacks-Of course you'll need snacks. Stock up on chips, pretzels, veggies with ranch or yogurt dip, popcorn, candy, fruit, etc. Always have something healthy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If your bedroom is big enough for the amount of people coming over, that's a great choice. Make sure that, if you are sleeping in your bedroom, that there is enough floor space. It would be unfair for the guests to sleep on the floor and for you to sleep on your bed. Unless your room has a lot of floor space, sleep somewhere else. If a large area in your basement is finished, sleep there. An alternative is the family/mud/living room. Anywhere that has a TV, floor space, and a table for snacks should be a good place to sleep and hang out.\n\n\nTry to pick a hangout spot where siblings and parents generally won't be. You wouldn't want to be bothered, unless you want your brother or sister joining in on the fun. Try to find out where in the house they'll be (most likely their room), or if they won't be in the house at all!\n\n, Get a trash bag and throw away any junk. Put dirty clothes in the washer or hamper, and put clean ones away. Dust off the TV, and bring any pillows, blankets, and sleeping bags to where you are sleeping. If necessary, vacuum the floor. Put all snacks in bowls and set them on a table. Charge your iPod (if you have one) so it will be ready to play. Make sure you have lots of games and movies, too. You don't have to do any major cleaning, just make sure the floor is clean, and your house looks presentable.\n\n\nAnother good idea is to clean the bathrooms. Your guests will be going there, so it better be fresh and clean for them! Plus, your parents will be proud. Take out the bathroom trash, fix any rugs, change the toilet paper, soap, and towel, and clean the sink. If you don't know how to clean the toilet, leave that to your parents.\n Get some different colors of nail polish and give each other manicures and pedicures. If you want, do some nail art for extra pizazz. You could also get some gem stickers to stick on your nails. Have fun, and be creative with colors and designs. Check out these articles for cool ideas:\n\n\nNewspaper Nails\nPanda Nail Art\nCheckered Nails\nComic Strips\nFacebook Nails\nHarry Potter Nails\nPopcorn Nails\n\n, Sit in a circle and have music playing if you want. Have somebody to go first, and ask \"Truth or Dare?\" For truth, ask an embarrassing question. For dare, make the player do something scary, slightly painful, or just plain weird. Remember, though, don't make truths too personal, and you don't have to answer! Same with dares. Never do anything dangerous. Your friends will understand, and if they don't, they aren't good friends.\n\n\nGood Dares:Make out with a pillow/stuffed animal, make an impression of somebody in or out of the group, describe someone in the group in 5 words and have everyone guess who it is, have a conversation with the wall.\nGood Truths:What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever done, Who is your crush, What's the baddest thing you've ever done, If you could change three things about yourself what would they be?\n\n, Whatever you can find works great, but some ideas are UNO, Scene it (with your favorite movie), Twister, and Clue. Play one of these if guests seem to get bored, or just for fun! Make sure that all guests are familiar with the rules. If not, quickly explain them to them or just play the game and have them learn as you play. However, games like Twister and Uno are easy and pretty much everyone knows how to play those games.\n What sleepover doesn't have movies? You should probably watch movies at nighttime, but not when guests are about to fall asleep. Bring out the popcorn, turn off the lights, and get a bunch of movies for guests to pick from. You can always watch the other ones later, but take this vote for movies to watch first. Make sure that everyone is okay with whatever movie you are watching, and don't watch PG 13 and/or R rated movies unless you have permission by your parents and all the guests' parents. Here is a list of some movies you can watch if you happen to like them:\n\n\nHarry Potter\nPirates of the Caribbean\nThe Clique\nElla Enchanted\nUp\nDespicable Me\nAnother Cinderella Story\nElf\nMean Girls\n\n, Crafts are a great idea if you don't want to be bored, and it's a memory for you and the guests to take home. This is an inexpensive and fun thing to do at a sleepover. Here are three simple ideas for crafts and how to make them:\n\n\n\nPicture Frames. Take a group shot of you and your friends, and get some wooden frames, paint, foam stickers, and glitter paint. Decorate and be creative.\n\nNecklaces. Get string, beads, and scissors to string on cool patterns. There are some kits for necklace making, so you can get one of these for extra beads and string.\n\nDecorate pillowcases. Get some colorful fabric markers, glue, gems, and jewels, and get decorating, writing, and drawing! You can have everyone sign their name on the case.\n Blast the tunes and sing to the top of your lungs (unless others are sleeping, then tone it down a bit). You can do karaoke or just sing to your iPod. Dance, too. You can have a dancing or singing competition if you want, but don't leave your friends out. Let everyone win at some point. Or, you can make up your own dance to a song as a group and record it to watch later. If you have a disco ball or flashing lights, don't forget them!\n\n, Although you may think that you're a little old for dress-up, you're not! Instead of just dressing up, have a fashion show. Find some old hats, beads, Halloween costumes, wigs, anything that you and your guests can wear. Take turns being the judge, and judge the girls (be nice) on style, creativity, anything you want from 1 to 10, 10 being the best. Have each girl pick their song and strut your stuff!\n\n, Do this when you are getting tired, but still don't want to go to sleep. Catch up with each other, and talk to your heart's desire! Don't hurt feelings, of course. Everybody loves some juicy gossip at a sleepover. Talk about crushes. What girls don't? Who is cute/funny/totally a jerk? If you want to, look through an old school yearbook to see the boys. You could also talk about sports (which do you like/dislike) or school (teachers/tests/homework).\n\n\nIf you find that everyone is totally silent, crack a few jokes, tell scary stories, or play \"Would you rather?\". For would you rather, take turns asking each other what they would rather do. For example, would you rather lose an arm or a leg, kiss _________ or __________, walk into a glass wall in front of ____________ or step in a giant hole in front of ________?\n\n, Popcorn, chips, ice cream, soda, and maybe even pizza rolls work good. If anyone has any allergies, try not to include those foods.\n Get out the nail polish, and if you have a make-up kit, get that out, too.\n Get a couple comedies, some scary movies, and dramas. That way, everyone's happy.\n, Some fun games are:\n\n\nBlob tag. It starts out with one person as the blob, and they tag people. The people they tag connect arms with them and go to tag other players. When the blob has six people, they can split into two groups of three.\nHide-And-Seek tag. The person who's It counts to thirty with eyes closed and the others go and hide. The It person has to find them and tag them. The first one to be tagged is the new It. Or the last person can be It.\nVolleyball, kick ball, baseball, etc. You get it.\n, If you have a trampoline, you can sneak out at like, 3 am and jump on it. If it's cold out, stay inside and..\n\n\nPlay truth or dare.\nTell scary stories.\nIf it's not too late, prank call boys/pizza places.\nDo make-overs.\nPractice gymnastics.\n Mess around for a few more hours, or until they get picked up. After everyone leaves or there's only your really close friend left, clean up.\n Do just one or a few of these. You don't need much, and you can still have fun inside or outside.\n You can decorate cookies with frosting, sprinkles, and m&ms. Or, make chex mix to have for movies. Put in pretzels, m&ms, popcorn, raisins, and marshmallows. You can also roast marshmallows when it's starting to get dark out.\n Play flashlight tag! It's the same as tag, but with flashlights in the dark. In the summer, run through a sprinkler if a nearby pool is not available. Go for a walk if it's still light out. You could also work on your gymnastics (make sure everyone knows how to at least a cartwheel first, and if not, teach them how.)\n\n, Don't worry if it's raining, just go to the movies. You can put on makeup with your eyes closed (make sure you clean up, though). Play hair salon. Braid the hair, or give each other ponytails or buns with cool hair clips, barrettes, and scrunchies. If you are bored, play Charades. Make your own videos or take a lot of pictures of each other. Or, play Wii. Some good games are Mario Kart, Wii Sports, and Just Dance 2, but anything works. Hide and seek is also a great game, and you don't need anything.\n\n"}

There are different opinions on which option is better. Each choice has unique challenges and advantages that you should weigh carefully before making a decision. Buying an existing pharmacy. With this option, you'll get a pharmacy that has already been established and has a consumer base. You may also be able to keep some of the staff that worked in the previous pharmacy, which will save time searching for employees later. However, it will most likely be more expensive to buy an existing pharmacy. You'll have to get a bigger loan, find more investors, and wait longer before you start turning a profit from your business.\nBuilding a new pharmacy. This option is often cheaper than buying an existing business. With fewer financial arrangements to worry about, you can open the store faster. However, you'll be starting from scratch with customers, so earning a profit may take longer. You'll have to advertise extensively, preferably before your store opens, to make sure you have enough customers to keep your business afloat. It may take a while before enough people know your store to give you a consistent profit margin.;\n, This will give you an idea of what sort of services your pharmacy should offer to set it apart from others. Spend some time talking to local residents about their healthcare needs. This way, you'll see if the local population has any unique needs that your drug store can cater to. By tailoring your services to the local community, you can successfully compete with chain stores that don't offer specialized services. Government agencies or chambers of commerce can often provide this type of information.Determine demographic information that may affect your business. For instance, if the neighborhood has a large elderly population, you may want to consider catering towards geriatric needs.\nLook at the economic state of the neighborhood. If the area is economically depressed, you'll have to keep your prices low to attract customers. This will also help determine the cost of owning a business in the area. If the area is affluent you may be able to charge more money, but you'll also probably pay more in rent, taxes, fees, etc.\nPay special attention to if an independent pharmacy recently closed in the area. If you can, investigate why it closed. You can find out what mistakes this owner made that you can avoid, or it may be a sign to avoid an area altogether.\n One of the most important aspects to any successful business is location. When investigating a location, there are numerous things you'll want to keep in mind.\n\n\nWhat is the competition in the area? If there are several chain pharmacies within a few blocks, you'll have a tough time building your business. It isn't impossible, however. Independent pharmacies can compete with chains if they offer better service or a higher level of expertise than these competitors. You will, however, have to work much harder to build a successful pharmacy if there are chains close by.\nIs the area visible? Will people walking or driving by be able to notice your pharmacy? This is crucial for when you are just starting out, so you'll want to pick an area that is visible to the local population.\nLook for nearby businesses. Office buildings and businesses are not only a potential source of customers, but also an indication if the area is good for business. Large chains like McDonald's usually conduct extensive research on a location before opening. If there are some of these nearby, it means other businesses have marked this as a profitable area.\nConsider the accessibility of your store. It would be good if you had room for a parking lot or there was abundant street parking. Since many of your customers may be elderly, you'll also want an area without stairs or long walks. Do not forget to consider accessibility for those with disabilities as well. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) website can provide additional information.\n Running a small business is always challenging. It can be both reassuring and informative to talk to others who have been in your position. Meet with other businessmen and independent pharmacists and ask if they have any advice to offer. While independent pharmacists in your immediate area might not be willing to share secrets, you can join national organizations and talk with other professionals, who are not in competition with you, and get valuable advice.Click here for a list of national pharmacy organizations that you can join.\n A good accountant is crucial for a small business' success. Acquiring the capital to start a business and managing the business' finances will be a challenge, so you'll need someone who is experienced to guide you through the process. An accountant not only helps you with taxes and balances your books- he will also be your financial adviser and counsel you on business decisions. Therefore, you'll want to hire someone you can trust. There are many things to consider when looking for an accountant.A personal referral is usually the best way to find a reliable accountant. Ask other local small business owners who their accountants are and if they're satisfied with their work. You could also see if your local Chamber of Commerce hosts networking events for small business owners where you could connect with potential accountants.\nSchedule an appointment with potential accountants. Most accountants will offer a free introductory meeting for potential clients. When you compile a list of candidates, meet with them and discuss their experience and qualifications to see if they would be a good fit for your business.\nFind out if a candidate has experience working with a small business and in the medical field. Small businesses and pharmacies have unique needs, and you'll want someone who has worked with small businesses and pharmacies or other businesses in the medical field before and understands how they work.\n Before obtaining a loan or finding investors, you'll need to develop a plan for your business. You will then present this plan to potential investors to attract capital to start your business. With the help of your accountant and any other financial/legal advisers you may have, draw up a plan for opening and growing your business. A good business plan should at least do the following.A description of the service your business will offer. Does something set you apart from other drug stores? Will you cater to a specific niche? Investors will want to see this description to determine if your business will offer the kind of service to make it profitable.\nA projection for the profitability of your business. What are projected annual earnings for your business? How long will it take for you to begin earning a profit? Where will your business be in the next few years? Long-term calculations are important to show investors that they will earn a profit if they provide you with the necessary capital.\nA full breakdown of your costs. Exactly how much capital do you need to open this store? Include rent, legal fees, advertising costs, renovations, and anything else that will go into opening your store. Also include an amount needed for day-to-day operations. Pharmacies typically take several weeks to get money from insurance companies for the prescriptions they sell, so you'll need money to cover your expenses until you receive this revenue.\nThe money you've already acquired or will be putting down yourself. Investors and banks will usually want to see that you've put down money yourself for the business. This can vary, but it is usually around 20%.\n Bank loans can cover a few months to few years of your pharmacy expenses, depending on the type of loan. Present your business plan to your bank while applying for a loan. A well-drawn out business plan will demonstrate to the bank that your drug store will be a sound investment, and it will be willing to grant you a loan. Also remember that the bank will probably ask more questions about the business in addition to what is in the business plan, so be prepared to fully explain the business and your own finances., In addition to bank loans, you can find private investors to cover the opening and operating costs of your business. These can either be friends or family, or other business owners interested in diversifying their portfolios. Present your business plan to these potential investors to demonstrate that your pharmacy will bring them a profit.\n\n\nIn your agreement with investors, be sure to define exactly what your relationship to them will be. Are they just providing a loan that will be paid back with interest, or are they actually buying into your business? Make sure you are both clear on what your relationship will be if they provide you with capital to avoid any problems in the future. It would help to draw up a contract and have it notarized to make your agreement official and legally binding.\n Like with all businesses, you'll need to insure your drug store to prevent financial loss for yourself. Some insurance, like theft and fire, are standard for small businesses. Others, like professional liability insurance, is more unique. Be sure to talk to your accountant, an insurance agent, and perhaps a lawyer to find out what kinds of insurance you'll need for your business.\n Running a small business can be unpredictable. It's therefore very important to have procedures in place so your employees will respond appropriately to the numerous situations they might experience. Require all new employees to read the manual as part of their training. This will ensure that all your staff are familiar with the store's policies and procedures.\n\n\nInclude the proper way to interact with customers in your manual. Keeping your customers happy is your main concern when starting a small business, so you should make certain all your employees are friendly and helpful.\nAlso include what is inappropriate behavior. Make clear what sort of activities are grounds for a warning and which ones are grounds for termination. That way if you have to resort to firing someone, you can say that this was all clearly spelled out in the manual.\n No matter how good you are at multi-tasking, you'll need a great staff in your pharmacy to help make it successful. Take care in hiring all of your employees, from pharmacists to cashiers. Perform background checks, interview them, and make sure they are all up to the task. A single bad employee can give your store a bad reputation, which will hurt your business., All pharmacies need a licensed pharmacist on staff during open hours. If you're planning on starting a pharmacy, perhaps you are a pharmacist and will be performing that task. If this is the case, you should still have a few backup pharmacists to call in case you get sick or need a day off. As the business owner, you also have to concentrate on making the business successful. Sometimes this means taking a step back from pharmacy duties and managing the business at large.\n Techs help pharmacists by counting pills, typing out prescriptions, and making phone calls. While techs usually don't need to have special qualifications, some pharmacies prefer to hire pharmacy students for these jobs because they are acquainted with drugs and pharmacy management. Try advertising at nearby pharmacy schools if you're looking for good techs. Usually a pharmacy has two techs on duty at all times, although if your store gets busy you may need more.\n Usually drug stores have both a pharmacy and a convenience store that sells household items (usually called the \"front\"). If this is the case, you should have two cashiers, one for the pharmacy and one for the front. This way your lines won't get backed up and you'll keep everything running smoothly.\n These workers make sure the shelves are neat and well-stocked, and the store is clean. They are very important because an untidy store will drive away customers. For smaller stores, usually having only one stock worker on duty at a time will do, but larger stores will probably need more to keep everything tidy.\n If your store is small enough, you might be able to oversee the pharmacy and the front by yourself. For a larger store, however, you'll have to delegate duties. Managers oversee the employees and activities of their given area. They also help with insurance, billing, accounting, and other office tasks. If your store is large, you might need two managers, one to oversee the pharmacy and one to oversee the front. That way they can report to you and keep you updated on what goes on in the entire store.\n Unfortunately, pharmacies are becoming targets for robberies because of the drugs they carry. For this reason, it may be a good idea to have a security guard on duty who can help prevent robberies and keep the store safe.\n You'll need at least the following to make your drug store ready to open. This is only a suggested list, and you'll likely find that you need other items to get your store ready.Computers and all the necessary software.\nCash registers.\nPhones and phone lines.\nGood-quality chairs for waiting areas. Make sure these chairs have arm rests so elderly or disabled patients can get up easily.\nInventory for the front of the store, like paper towels, OTC drugs and products, food, cleaning supplies, and anything else you'd like to sell.\nVials and pill bottles for the pharmacy.\n The store's layout is important for making customers want to shop with you. A cluttered store with a poor layout will drive away customers, which will hurt or even sink your business. Keep the following guidelines in mind when designing your floor plan.Have a cash register by the front door so customers can check out and then leave conveniently.\nKeep all pharmacy-related activities behind a counter in the back of the store. This will ensure that pharmacy staff can work efficiently, and is also important for safety.\nMake aisles wide enough for wheelchairs and people with disabilities to easily travel down.\nDesignate an area for counseling. Your drug store should have a private area where pharmacists and techs can counsel patients on their medications. In some locations, this is even a law. Ideally this should be back by the pharmacy, so your pharmacist doesn't have to travel far from his post to counsel a patient.\nOrganize aisles by product and hang signs above aisles indicating which products are there. This will help customers find what they need quickly and ensure they leave happy.\n All businesses need security in place to keep employees safe and protect your financial investment. You should look into surveillance cameras, alarms, grates for windows, and a safe to help thwart robberies.\n These certifications vary depending on the location of your pharmacy, so you'll have to consult local laws to ensure that you are meeting all necessary qualifications. It would be helpful to consult a lawyer who is familiar with the laws for your industry to make sure you are getting all the paperwork you need. For example, in the United States, a state pharmacy license. Each state has a board of pharmacy that evaluates pharmacies and grants licenses. Contact your state's board of pharmacy to get this certification. Sometimes the state board of pharmacy will also want to inspect your pharmacy before it opens, so stay in contact with this office to make sure you are complying with all laws.\nAn additional requirement in the United States is a DEA number. The Drug Enforcement Agency regulates the sale of narcotics, so you will have to register with this agency for permission to do so. Contact your local DEA office to get federal certification.\n Any new business will have a few bugs that have to get worked out- your drug store will be no exception. Therefore, it is a good idea to have some time before the official grand opening to work out the kinks.\n\n\nIf you have a big flood of customers on your grand opening and you experience problems, you and your staff can easily be overwhelmed. If service suffers because of it, your store could get a bad reputation right from the start.\nTo avoid big problems, open your doors one or two months before your actual grand opening. This will help you work out any kinks in your system with only a few customers to deal with. That way, you can make sure everything runs smoothly on your grand opening.\n You'll want to make sure that by your opening day, everyone in the community knows about your store. There are many ways you can advertise your business before your grand opening.\n\n\nHang a large \"Coming Soon\" banner outside your store to pedestrians and drivers will know that a business will open soon, and take out an ad in the \"Coming Soon\" section of your local newspapers.\nSend out circulars in the mail or place them on houses manually. These flyers should describe your business and the services you will offer. It would also be good to include some opening day sales to attract customers.\nUse social media. Start a social media page for your business. Share it on your own personal page and ask friends, family, and staff to do the same. With enough shares, you can get a lot of free advertising.\n When your store is all set up and you've worked out any problems in your system, announce to your local community that you've officially opened. Contact local news outlets and see if they will cover the event. Also see if the mayor or another local politician will partake in a ribbon-cutting ceremony- this will attract the press and a lot of community attention. With a big grand opening event, you can ensure that the entire community will know about your store opening.\n Pharmacists and other small business owners are often active in their local communities. This helps expose both them and their businesses to the public and helps profits. See if there are any events at local schools, parks, religious institutions, and civic associations. Stay active in your local community to have your business recognized., Referrals from doctors can be a great way to grow your consumer base. If there is a doctor's office nearby, go in and introduce yourself. Ask if the doctor would mind you leaving a few business cards or circulars in his office. If you make a good impression and demonstrate that you're a health professional who cares about your patients, he may start referring his patients to you."}

{"title": "How to Pick a Bowling Ball3", "summary": "look no further than the alley.\nimitate other bowlers.\nfind a good pro shop.", "article": " The house balls at the bowling alley are not high performance balls. Specifically, it is very difficult to get a hooked throw using one of these. However, these balls can be good for beginners because they have a lot of control and are good for straight line throws. If you\u2019re starting out and don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money, these can be an excellent choice.\n\n\nEven experts will occasionally throw the sort of polyester balls that are used as the house balls at bowling allies. Specifically, professional will use them for picking up spares, because when doing that an accurate, straight shot is typically preferable to a hook. Similarly, if you\u2019re still struggling to keep the ball out of the gutter, these are probably the best balls for you., When you watch bowling, pay attention to what professionals are using. At the alley, talk to some of the better bowlers about their bowling ball choice. Be particularly mindful of the choices of a bowler who has a style similar to yours.The issue with this technique is that there isn\u2019t one best ball on the market.

Ask around for a shop with knowledgeable staff, possibly even employees who were themselves professional bowlers.\n Ask other bowlers and look online for a bowling shop with highly knowledgeable staff. Many shops will employee staff members who were themselves either successful professional or semi-professional bowlers.Because bowling balls have become so technologically advanced over recent years, it is important to have expert advice.

You may also distract your opponents before he tries to receive the ball so that he fumbles it and is penalized with a strike.You may throw at the direction of players you know are scared to catch the ball to build on the nerves and increase the likelihood that they will fumble and be out of the game.\nDare a bad thrower to throw in your direction if you know you can catch it and get him out.\n Use the rules to your advantage. For example, if you are playing with rules like \u201cleft handsies\u201d where everyone must only catch with their left hand, aim at player\u2019s right hand so that it makes it difficult for them to reach over and catch it with there left.\n\n\nYou may also throw the ball close to the end line so that a receiving player may be forced to step out of bounds if she attempts to catch it.\n The thrower has an automatic advantage because only she knows where the ball will go. If you have good aim and timing you will be able to continue your turn as the thrower as you get other players out. However, this may be difficult if you do not start as the thrower. Look to catch the ball if the server fumbles or for similar opportunities to establish yourself as the new thrower.\n\n"}

The length of each rectangle should match the length of the final prism, and the width of the two rectangles should match the width of the final prism.After drawing both rectangles, use the ruler to measure them again. Both rectangles must be equal in size and must accurately match the length and width of the rectangular prism you wish to create.\nOnce you are certain that both rectangles are the correct length and width, cut them out with sharp scissors.\nNote that these two rectangles will form the top and bottom of your rectangular prism.\n\nExample: Measure and cut two rectangles, each with a length of 6 inches (15 cm) and a width of 4 inches (10 cm).\n Use a ruler and pencil to draw two more rectangles from heavy construction paper.

Tape the length sides together on one side of the paper.The paper rectangles should be lined up in the following order: length-by-width, length-by-height, length-by-width, length-by-height. Do not place identical rectangles next to one another.\nNote that the rectangles should be lined up so that their length sides lie directly next to the length side of the adjacent rectangle.\nApply one to two strips of tape to each shared edge. When finished, all four rectangles should be taped together into one strip.\n\nExample: Alternate the 6-inch by 4-inch (15-cm by 10-cm) rectangles with the 6-inch by 3-inch (15-cm by 7.6-cm) rectangles, matching the 6-inch (15-cm) sides together. Tape the 6-inch (15-cm) sides in place.\n Fold the strip so that the two unattached length-side ends meet. Use one or two pieces of tape to hold these two ends together.\n\n\nAs you fold, make sure that the strip is folding at the edges between separate rectangular faces. You may need to use your thumbnail to crease the tape in between these edges, making it easier to fold.\nWhen done, you should have something that looks like a rectangular tube. The prism shape is almost complete, but two sides are still missing at this point.\n\nExample: Fold up the strip and tape together the two loose 6-inch (15-cm) sides.\n Position the two remaining rectangles over the two open ends of the shape. Use tape to attach all four sides of each rectangle to the matching sides of the rectangular prism.\n\n\nMake sure that the height side of each rectangle matches the height side of the prism. Likewise, the width side of each rectangle must match the width side of the prism.\nStart by taping one side of each rectangle in place, then tape the opposite side. The paper should already stay in place at that point, but taping the remaining two sides will provide greater security.\n\nExample: Position the 4-inch (10-cm) sides of one rectangle against the 4-inch (10-cm) sides of the rectangular prism. The 3-inch (7.6-cm) sides should naturally match up, as well. Tape the rectangle in place, then repeat with the remaining rectangle.\n Use a ruler to measure all sides of the finished shape. The length, width, and height dimensions should each match the required dimensions you needed to fulfill.\n\n\nAt this point, the rectangular prism is complete.\n\nExample: The final rectangular prism should have a length of 6 inches (15 cm), a width of 4 inches (10 cm), and a height of 3 inches (7.6 cm).\n\n"}

The juice will help the salt stick to the glass.Consider chilling the glasses in the freezer before salting the rims and serving the margaritas. Cold glasses will make your margaritas stay cooler longer.\n If you don't want the salty-sweet taste of a margarita served with a salty rim, you may want to make a sugar rim. Keep in mind that this will add to the overall sweetness of your drink. To make a sugar rim, have two small rimmed plates ready. Pour a little water onto the bottom of one plate and add enough sugar to cover the bottom of the other plate. Dip the rims of your margarita glasses in the water and immediately dip them into the sugar.Different sugars will give different textures. Try demerara sugar if you want a lot of crunch and a rich flavor. For a light crunch, use granulated sugar. You probably don't want to use powdered sugar since it may dissolve too quickly.\n Since strawberry margaritas aren't as common as classic margaritas made with lime, garnish with strawberries. This way, if you're serving the cocktails to guests, they'll be able to tell what flavor the drinks are. Slice limes and strawberries thinly to float in the drinks.Since fruit won't easily float in the frozen margarita, you may want to leave the fruit whole or in larger slices. Simply cut a slit in a whole strawberry so you can set it in the rim of the glass.\n You can easily add different fruit flavors to your strawberry margarita. For example, you can add frozen sliced bananas for a strawberry banana margarita. Or for a strawberry lemonade margarita, replace the lime juice with lemon juice (or use frozen lemonade concentrate). To make a strawberry coconut margarita, add a little sweetened cream of coconut for an extra tropical flavor.To garnish, consider adding sliced banana, sliced lemons, or shredded coconut on the rim of the glass.\n If you'll be serving drinks to minors or those who can't drink alcohol, you may want to make a batch of non-alcoholic margaritas.

This can help soften the blow of your critique.\n\n\nStarting with an honest compliment can get the conversation started on right footing, and avoid making the other person feel attacked.Sticking with the example of a friend who makes hurtful jokes, you might start by saying, \"Jim, I think you are a really funny guy. The thing is....\"\n\n, When raising your criticism, keep tone of voice calm and friendly. This will reduce the likelihood of the other person becoming defensive or angry.Even if the issue you are raising is something that makes you feel upset, keep your tone thoughtful and relaxed. The other person will be more likely to see your point of view.\n What you do with your face, arms, and body while criticizing someone can also play an important role in how the other person receives your message. Make sure your body language communicates calmness and matches what you are saying.For example, crossing your arms can communicate to some people that you are upset or closed off. Pointing at someone can be seen as an attacking gesture. Maintain eye contact, and try to keep your body language open and friendly, or at least neutral.\n Choosing your words with care may be the most important part of tactful criticism. Explain your problem with the other person's actions using non-judgemental language. Focus on your feelings about the issue rather than criticizing the other person.For example, if your friend has been making racially insensitive jokes, do not say \"You seem like a racist\" or even \"Your jokes are kind of racist.\" Instead, say \"Sometimes your jokes are upsetting to me, and I worry that you might be offending others as well.\"\nSay what you need to say in \"soft\" terms that won't feel like an attack. Criticize the behavior that's bothering you, not the character of the person you are criticizing.Personal attacks are seldom well received.\nKeep your message short and to the point. Talking too much can increase the possibility that you will accidentally say something you regret.\n Your criticism may be better received if you can point out that you have made similar mistakes in the past. This shows the other person that you can relate to him or her and that you aren't suggesting you are superior.In the case of your friend making the offensive jokes, you might say something like: \"I understand you aren't trying to upset anyone. One time, I accidentally upset some of my friends by...\" From here, you could go on to tell a story of a time you upset people without meaning to.\n Keep your criticism focused on one specific issue, and don't stockpile criticisms to deliver all at once. This can make the other person feel overwhelmed and attacked.If your friend who makes insulting jokes also has a tendency to burp loudly at meals, this is not something to bring up right now. That's a separate issue that you can raise at a later time if you decide it's important.\n During and after the criticism, offer praise for changes you see in the other person's behavior. This lets him or her know you have noticed any efforts that have been made in response to the issue you have raised.During the conversation, you might tell your friend, \"I really appreciate how sensitive to my feelings about this you have been during this conversation\"\nAfter the conversation, if your friend stops making offensive jokes, you could say something like, \"Your jokes have really made me laugh lately. Thanks for hearing my concerns about this.\"\n\n, It is not unusual for a person who is criticized to respond by raising issues he or she may have with you. If this happens, accept these criticisms calmly and with an open mind."}

Keep in mind that, since we are not using exact size measurements and angles, these distances are only estimations., Keep your arm at a forty-five degree angle and point it directly at the cloud. If the cloud is roughly the same size as your fist (or larger), it is most likely a low level cloud. A low level cumulus cloud is called a stratocumulus and exist from 0 kilometers (0.0\u00a0mi) to 2 kilometers above the ground., Your arm should remain pointed straight at the cloud at a forty-five degree angle. If the cloud is significantly smaller than your fist, it is probably above the lower level. Altocumulus clouds are mid-level cumulus clouds, ranging from 2 kilometers (1.2\u00a0mi) to 7 kilometers above the ground. From your vantage point on the ground, they can be identified as being roughly the same size as your thumbnail., Again, your arm should be extended toward the cloud at a forty-five degree angle. If the cloud in question is in the high altitude level, it will appear to be roughly the same size as your smallest fingernail.

You can do this by putting your dog in a single room, preferably one with a vinyl or tile floor that is easily cleaned up. If you don\u2019t want to give your dog the run of the whole room, you can limit its space even further by placing it in a smaller nook or in a hallway and placing a baby gate (or gates) in a strategic location to keep your dog confined to the smaller space.Rooms with carpets are not preferred since they are difficult to clean up if your dog soils them.;\n, If your dog needs to go to the bathroom more often, the easiest thing to do is to put it out more often. Provide opportunities for your dog to go out when it wakes up and before it goes to sleep, especially. Come home doing your lunch break, if possible, to let your dog out.If it is not possible to let your dog out frequently during the middle of the day, ask a family member or trusted neighbor to let your dog out while you\u2019re at work or school.\n You may want to give your dog an indoor option for the times when he can\u2019t hold it. Some things you might try include:\n\n\nGetting a doggy litter box. Set up a large litter box for your dog. If you notice that he is about to soil in the house, then take him to the litter box. Do this a few times and he may begin to understand that the litter box is an option for him if you are not there to let him out.\nPlacing puppy pads or newspaper around the house. You can also show your dog these options when he seems like he is about to soil in the house.\n Not only can a dog sitter let your dog out more frequently, but they can be there to relieve your dog\u2019s anxiety due to being alone. Feelings of loneliness can contribute to an increase in your dog\u2019s house soiling, especially in older dogs who might be more fearful due to a decline in their senses.If you have a family member who can be home with your older dog during the day, you should be able to reduce the number of house soiling incidents your dog has.\nIf you don\u2019t have a family member who can help out, hire a pet sitter. You can find pet sitters both online through classifieds and through the recommendations of your friends who also have pets.\nSometimes you can get neighbors or their teens to pet-sit for you.\nEnsure that your pet sitter, neighbor, or family member understands that your pet is older and needs special attention.\n If your older dog suddenly feels it does not have enough space, it might start house soiling in order to mark its territory. For example, if you recently had a baby, obtained another pet, or got married, your dog might now feel cramped for space. Provide your dog with a spacious crate and/or comfortable dog bed where it feels secure. Your dog can retreat there to self-soothe when it feels stressed and house-soiling incidents will (hopefully) decline., Doggie diapers are like regular diapers, wearable items designed to manage your older dog\u2019s accidents. This should be the last thing you try and you should consult your dog\u2019s veterinarian first. To use the doggie diapers, slip your dog\u2019s rear legs through the diaper, lift it up and around its rear end, then seal the diaper using the built-in sealing mechanism.Doggie diapers are single-use and available at most pet stores.\nConsult manufacturer directions for more information about how to use your doggie diaper.\n\n"}

It\u2019s also great if you\u2019re on a budget as many of your building materials can be found around your home. However, models built from cardboard won\u2019t be as durable or sturdy as models built from other materials.\n\n\nEmpty cereal boxes, paper towel tubes, and toilet paper tubes are great cardboard building materials.Adhesives include masking tape, craft glue, and spray adhesive.\nOther household materials such as tin cans and scrap paper can be used as well.;\n, Craft foam, also called foam core, is sold in thick sheets at craft stores. This medium will create sturdy and lightweight structures. However, some beginners have difficulty cutting the foam. If you\u2019ve never used foam before, buy extra sheets to practice on. To work with foam, you will need:\n\n\nA sharp craft knife for slicing the foamA heated foam wire cutter for cutting large pieces of foam (optional)\nTacky glue, a hot glue gun, or a liquid adhesive\n\n, Wood is the best choice for large, sturdy castles. These castles can last years if they\u2019re built properly. However, beginners may find woodworking difficult and expensive. Tools for woodworking include:\n\n\n\nA circular saw for cutting the wood\nA hammer\nA screwdriver\nWood glue\nNails and screws of various sizes\n\n, Before designing your castle, consider any factors that will affect your design. For example, consider your space limitations. This includes your workspace and the display space. If your design is too large, you won\u2019t have anywhere to put your castle.Other things to consider include:\n\n\nWhat are the limitations of your building medium? For example, paper castles won\u2019t last as long as wooden castles.\nHow big is your budget? Paper castles are cheaper than foam or wooden castles.\nHow much time can you devote to your project? Wooden castles are very sturdy, but they will take weeks to complete.\n There are many excellent model castle designs available online and at craft stores. These designs are good for beginners or for those working with unforgiving mediums such as wood. However, if you have a specific design in mind, it may be best to design your own castle.\n When a drawing is \u201cto scale,\u201d it is drawn with accurate proportions.To create accurate proportions, scale the measurements of your castle down. For example, if your castle will be three feet by two feet (.9 meters by .6 meters), your drawing could be three inches by two inches (7.6 cm by 5.08 cm).\n\n\nIt may be useful to use graph paper to sketch your castle.\nInclude any small details such as turrets or a drawbridge.\n Your castle will be composed of several large sections with many small sections mounted on top. For example, if you\u2019re building a simple square castle with towers on each corner, your large section would be a square shape and your small sections would be cylinders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSketch each section separately to help you visualize the building process.\n Use your sketch as a guide. Create measurements for each separate section of the castle. Visualize building the castle with these different sections to help check your measurements. Make sure you include any accent features. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurrets\nTowers\nRoofs\nA large base for your castle\n\n, This step is optional, but it may be useful to create paper templates of any repetitive forms. For example, if you\u2019re making a foam castle with a lot of towers, create a paper template of a tower. Next, lay the template on each piece of foam to cut out the tower. Each tower will be the same size and shape.\n\n\nThis method is also useful when creating paper castles. Instead of drawing and measuring each repetitive section, make a paper template to use.\n Depending on your building medium, you may need a saw, craft blade, or heated wire foam cutter. First, use a ruler and a pencil to mark the places you need to cut. Next, carefully cut out each piece of the castle, using your design as a guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be tempting to begin building after the first few pieces. However, if you cut all of the sections out before starting, it will be easier to finish the project.\nIt may be useful to number each piece to help you keep track of where they belong.\n Before you assemble the castle, cut out any windows, turrets, or doorways. Use your template as a guide. Otherwise, you may cut in the wrong places. If needed, use your ruler to measure any accents before cutting them out or create a paper template. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure out and draw small 1 x 1 inch squares (2.5 x 2.5 centimeters) along the top of the wall. Next, cut out every other square to create turrets.Create a paper template of a window. Use this window as a guide to ensure that all your windows look the same.\n These sections are the foundation of your castle. Use an adhesive such as tape or glue (or a hammer and nail if you\u2019re working with wood) to assemble each large section. After they\u2019re assembled, place each section in its proper spot. Remember to use the correct adhesives for your medium. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor foam, use spray adhesive, hot glue, or tacky glue.Use wood glue, screws, and nails to connect pieces of wood.\nFor cardboard, use white craft glue, glue sticks, and masking tape., These sections are the structural accents, such as towers, rooftops, and large gates. Completely assemble each section before connecting it to the larger base sections. When you have finished assembling these sections, your castle will be ready to decorate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use tacky glue, spray adhesive, or wood glue, let the structure dry for a few hours before decorating it.\n If you want to create a large, complex landscape around your castle, you will need a large base. Alternatively, use a small base as a simple mount for your castle. You won\u2019t be able to add a landscape, but the base will help keep all of the pieces together. Attach the castle with an adhesive if you\u2019re building with cardboard. If the castle is wooden, attach it with nails or screws.\n\n\nUse a strong foam board base for foam or paper castles.Use a strong wood sheet as a base for wooden castles.\n Most castles are painted gray. However, there are many castles that are beige, white, and brown. Additionally, consider using a darker shade of the same color to outline any bricks or embellishments. Each medium works best with specific kinds of paint. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use almost any kind of paint on wood. However, spray paint and water based acrylic paint work best.\nAny water based acrylic or latex paint works well on foam. However, avoid using spray paint as it will dissolve the foam.You can use water and oil based paints on paper and cardboard. However, use spray paint sparingly as it may make these mediums soggy and weak.\n Once the walls of the castle are dry, you can begin painting any embellishments. Use a variety of colors to paint accents on your castle. For example, use a deep burgundy to paint any rooftops. Other accents include:\n\n\nWindow sills\nWindow panes\nDoors and gates\n\n, If you\u2019re building a simple foam or cardboard castle, consider painting the landscape. This is a quick, easy way to give your castle a colorful backdrop. If you want to create a realistic landscape, visit a craft store for fake grass and small stones. Other realistic touches include:\n\n\nCreating small hills with foam and covering them with grass\nLining a small pathway with stones\nCreating a moat and filling it with clear epoxy to create \u201cwater\u201d\n\n, Place small accessories around the castle or on the landscape. Accessories can include small human figures, trees, shrubbery, bridges, and gates. Many of these items can be purchased at a craft store. However, if you\u2019re on a budget or if you\u2019re feeling inspired, you can make your own at home. For example:\n\n\nMake your own trees by gluing a shredded green sponge to some copper wire.Craft a drawbridge using tongue depressors and hot glue.\nCreate small bushes by crumpling small pieces of green tissue paper.\nUse a small jewelry chain to create a realistic drawbridge.\n\n"}

Let the tears flow freely, and spend as much time doing this as you need. You may need a whole day, or even several days to get it all out. Treat the process with the same sincerity as you would a true grieving process. You deserve it! If you don\u2019t invest time in releasing your intense feelings, they will continue bothering you when you perform.;\n, Take a break from singing and just listen to the song. If you can access other recordings, listen to as many versions of the song as possible. If no recordings are available, record yourself singing it once and just listen to that recording. Embrace the emotions that come over you as you listen. As intense or time-consuming as this process may be, your reward will be a deep insight into your emotional self. This will not just help the tears subside; you will likely start to heal from serious pain you still carry from past experiences. This will aid you on your quest to greater resilience.\n Make sure you write about this valuable experience. Verbalize what you are feeling. Write down your thoughts and read them aloud to yourself. Feel free to share these thoughts with a trusted friend. Articulate what you\u2019re feeling in the mirror. There is no such thing as coming to understand your feelings \"too much\", especially as a performer. Even if you think you are \"over it\" at this point, writing about your experience will help you preserve valuable insight for the future.\n Sing the song and allow your emotions to manifest themselves as they will. If you are still crying at this point, don't fret. The sting will lessen with time. In the meantime, you will learn how to sing through your crying. This skill will rescue you in emergencies when you get emotional during performance.\n If after cycling through these steps you still don\u2019t feel better, do something else. Take out the trash. Go for a walk. Work out at the gym. Talk to a good friend. Volunteer at a soup kitchen. Take a bubble bath. Do anything to get your mind off the song. A lively activity followed by relaxation could do wonders for you.\n When you're ready to sing the song again, take some time to imagine yourself doing so successfully. Close your eyes and imagine yourself performing the song. Visualize yourself doing so successfully. What do you sound like? What do you look like? What do you see around you? Take note of as many other details as you can. Act like a little kid and draw what you see. Let your right brain indulge in this sensory experience.\n By now you have let yourself cry it out, think deeply, take a break, and reflect about your experience. At this point, you have hopefully taken the edge off the pain you used to feel when singing this sad song. Go ahead. Sing it again and see what happens.\n If your attempt to sing still makes you bawl, don\u2019t give up. Repeat these steps in whatever order helps you the most. If your efforts seem futile, don\u2019t be shy about seeking professional help. There may be unresolved issues that need addressing\u2014not just so you can get through the song, but so you can live a happier life.\n\n"}

Ableton Live and Bitwig are two popular options.\n The beat powers the song and controls how danceable the music is. To form a good beat, try to pick out just the drums from a piece of dance music. Dance music is almost always in 4/4 time, but there are exceptions, such as \"Galvanize\" by The Chemical Brothers in which they throw in a 2/4 bar every few instrumental measures.\n\n\nHigh hat sounds good with straight eighth notes or sixteenths. You can use snare drum to accent and syncopate the beat. Hip-hop uses the clap, so you may want to try to use electronic snare instead., Rather than choosing just one prerecorded drum sound, try laying two different ones over each other. This will create a new and unique sound that you can add to your music. The sounds blend together so if you really like the attack of one beat but prefer the body of a different beat you can combine the two.The attack is the very beginning of a drum beat.\n Dance music usually starts with the catchy bassline and elaborates based on repetition.The bassline can also be the rhythm of a chord progression that you make. The bassline does not necessarily need to have a bass playing it, but you should choose an instrument that has a lower tone. These lower tones sound good when they are establishing the rhythm.\n Trust your ear \u2013 there\u2019s no exact way to do this. Understanding the sounds that work well together is an art. Don\u2019t throw sounds together that immediately sound dissonant and expect them to sound better later on down the road. If it doesn\u2019t work, ditch it.\n\n\nChoosing the right sounds at the beginning is much more important than tweaking levels later on. Pick something that gels right away. Otherwise you may end up rebuilding your track from the ground up later., Most dance music has a typical structure. This structure is Intro, Verse, Chorus, Breakdown, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus, and then Outro. The Breakdown generally ditches percussion as you transfer from the first chorus to the second verse and the Bridge is another transitional section popular in pop music.Consider the arc you want your song to have. Do you want an interlude, a big drop, or a build up? Try charting our how you want your song to sound on a piece of paper before you start building it.\n Generally the farther you progress in the song the more action there should be. Usually some layers are rhythms on the chord progression, others are the same note or riff played over and over despite the progression.\n You may want to rap or make two lines that rhyme and sound cool to repeat in certain parts of the song.Alternatively, you could go for a rock format with a verse and a chorus. You can even take out your favorite poem or nursery rhyme and read or sing it! It's up to you.\n\n\nSome sort of rhythmic phrase can add a whole new component to your dance music.\n\n"}

The lasso is a length of rope you can equip to hogtie victims, break in wild horses or subdue criminals. It is only available in the single-player game, and can only be unlocked during the quest \"Wild Horses, Tamed Passions\". Afterwards, you will be able to use it fully.;\n, Simply draw, aim and fire the lasso as you would a normal weapon. The reticule will point where the lasso will fire, and if you are close enough, it will lasso the target. Beware, however, the lasso does cause some damage to the target and therefore will count as assault if you are spotted by lawmen, in addition to any counts of kidnapping you will incur. Practice on criminals or gang members instead.\n Unlike in real life, where a tree or gallows would be suitable, due to the game's mechanics, you will need to find a low bridge, cliff or balcony. There are several cliffs around the Red Dead Redemption world, although there are fewer bridges. A good choice for one would be the bridge to the Tumbleweed gang hideout - it is low enough to hang people from and easily accessible. Balconies or ledges can be found in most towns.\n Ideally, they should be close to the area you have picked so that by the time you reach it, they haven't been dragged so far that they die. Alternatively, if you are using the bridge to Tumbleweed, you merely have to wait for a victim to pass by underneath.\n With your previous practice, this should be easy. Now it is a matter of dragging the victim to the hanging spot, making sure not to accidentally let go of the rope before you reach it. Try not to go through too dense a bush, as it will kill your victim faster before you reach your destination. If you are using the Tumbleweed bridge or similar, again, you will not have to move far, or even be on your horse to lasso and hang the target; you can simply lasso and enjoy.\n This can be done by riding diagonally at the cliff or similar, and then turning and riding parallel to it. Your victim should swing off the cliff, and if you come to stop, they should be hanging in mid-air off the ledge. Make sure to keep the rope held firmly. This step can be skipped if you are using the Tumbleweed bridge method, as they will already be hanging as soon as you lasso them if you lasso them as they pass underneath.\n Whether you're bringing an outlaw to justice, or doing dastardly deeds, the outcome should be that the victim will struggle for a while on the lasso before the rope either breaks or they collapse, dead.\n\n"}

Make sure you are getting enough rest, even if it means you have to turn down some party invitations, drop a class, or participate in fewer clubs and extracurriculars. You want to make the most of your college experience, but you need to be well-rested to stay healthy mentally and physically.\nLearn the signs and symptoms of depression and anxiety so you can identify if you or a friend is suffering.\n Many people may turn to binge drinking, drug abuse and risky sexual behavior in an attempt to cope with their uncomfortable feelings. Unfortunately, these coping strategies are not only dangerous, they can make your uncomfortable feelings even worse.\n\n\nBinge drinking is defined as drinking five or more alcoholic drinks on the same occasion at least one day out of the last month.According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAA), \"More than 97,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are victims of alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape.\"1,825 college students in that age group die each year from alcohol-related injuries, and more than 150,000 develop an \"alcohol-related health problem.\"The \"hook up\" culture that is often linked to excessive alcohol consumption has been linked to increased anxiety, depression, and drinking.If you are using alcohol, drugs, or sex to cope with negative feelings, talk to a trusted friend and seek out the help of a mental health professional.\n It may seem daunting, but getting help and talking to someone is the first step toward feeling better.Your college or university should have mental health or counseling services available to students, or should have the resources to connect you to a mental health professional in the community.There may also be clubs on campus, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) that offers peer-to-peer support.Try using the search option on ULifeline to find resources on your campus.\nIf you are not ready to seek professional help, try opening up to a trusted friend, family member, or professor.\n Stress is an unavoidable part of life, but there are ways you can eliminate unnecessary stress and cope with stressors. Becoming a healthy adult means learning healthy, productive ways to deal with stress in your life.\n\n\nLearn more about time management. People aren't born knowing how to juggle school, work, friends, family, hobbies, etc. It's a skill that you can learn at any time. One thing that may help is learning to say \"No\" so that you don't take on more than you can handle.Set goals and stop procrastinating. Putting things off to the last minute can cause your stress levels to skyrocket.\nTry journaling to help you understand your emotions, work through important decisions, and get any worries out of your head and down on paper.Find support through friends and family. These people can listen to you vent, help you through hard times, as well as laugh and celebrate with you. Don't try to deal with your stress on your own \u2014 the people who care about you will be happy to help.\nIdentify and work on changing negative thought patterns. Often, people fall into unproductive thought patterns, focusing on what they think they should or shouldn't do, seeing thing as black or white, catastrophizing, focusing on only the negative and discounting the positive, and more.Learning to challenge these thoughts, and learning more healthy ways to think, can do wonders for your mental health and stress levels.\n Suicide is the third-leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 24.1 in 10 college students has made a plan for suicide, and there are more than 1,000 suicides on college campuses every year.If you are considering suicide, call a friend or family member, or 1-800-SUICIDE or 1-800-273-TALK for immediate assistance. If you feel you are in immediate danger, call 911 or your local emergency number.You can also check yourself into the emergency room to keep yourself safe from harming yourself. Warning signs of suicide include:\n\n\nTalking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live.\nTalking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain.\nTalking about being a burden to others.\nIncreasing the use of alcohol or drugs.\nSleeping too little or too much.\nWithdrawn or feeling isolated.\nPreoccupation with death.\nMaking arrangements; setting one's affairs in order.\nGiving things away, such as prized possessions.\n\n"}

DHA supports the nervous system and thus is particularly crucial for the developing brains and eyes of babies in the womb.Though the role of EPA and DHA in cognitive development is undisputed, studies are inconclusive as to the ability of fish oil supplements to deliver these omega-3\u2019s effectively to the pregnant woman and her fetus.\nResearch suggests that you need 200 mg of DHA every day to support the growth of your baby\u2019s cognitive and visual systems., Some studies suggest that fish oil supplements can improve your baby\u2019s development significantly. For example, one recent study shows that toddlers born to mothers who ingested fish oil supplements displayed better hand-eye coordination than other toddlers whose mothers did not do so.Another study in Denmark found that the babies of women taking fish oil in the last trimester of pregnancy had a lower incidence of asthma., Despite some studies supporting the advisability of ingesting fish oil capsules, the evidence is far from conclusive. For example, a study in Australia concluded that the children of women who took fish oil during the last trimester of pregnancy performed no better on cognitive and language tasks than the children of women who did not.Even the above-mentioned Danish study warns against overly optimistic conclusions from their study.

English is useful for helping overcome imprecise angles and making sure that the ball enters the pocket from just the right direction.English refers to the left or right rotation of a ball, and is not be confused with topspin.A good example of when English might be necessary is when you have the angle of your shot zeroed in but striking the ball directly would cause it to deflect off the rails.\n Striking a ball with medium-to-high force causes it to skid rather than roll, which results in a truer banking angle. It also eliminates other factors that can interfere with your shot, like friction and drag from the felt. A gentler stroke, on the other hand, will give you more control over cue ball spin and English, which can come in handy for delicate shots.The power you put into your stroke will usually be determined by the distance between the cue and object balls, and between the balls and the rails., Sometimes, you won\u2019t have a clear path to a straight or banked shot. In these situations, banking the cue ball off the rails allows you to bypass obstacles and sink a ball in the process. It will then be a cinch to pull off shots that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible.Kick shots are also a good way to avoid fouls, since they don\u2019t require you to risk contacting the other player\u2019s balls.\nUnless you excel at kick shots, it\u2019s typically safest to use them as a last resort.\n When it comes to getting a feel for the table, there\u2019s no substitute for simply playing more. Even if a shot makes sense to you on theoretical level, you might have to attempt it dozens of times before you get the hang of it. This is especially true of bank shots, which force you to analyze the table and showcase impeccable technique.Make use of drills designed to refine your ability to size up bank shots on the fly.Start challenging players who are more skilled than you to gain crucial experience.\n\n"}

Hair symbolizes vitality, sex appeal, and youth. Men fear going bald because they fear that they are losing these things. However, the truth is that it\u2019s all in the mind. Reconciling yourself to less hair, and being proud of your baldness, could make you happier in the end.It is natural to feel some embarrassment when you first start to lose hair. The key is to neutralize this feeling of shame. You may not love the way you look at first, but you can\u2019t allow yourself to be paralyzed by it.Learn to recognize negative feelings and then consciously let them pass. There is a big difference between thinking \u201cI feel unattractive\u201d and \u201cI AM unattractive.\u201d If you feel silly, tell yourself, \u201cYes, I feel foolish.\u201d Then, move on with what you are doing without letting the thoughts control you.Some people call this a \u201cmental shrug.\u201d If somebody called you stupid, for instance, you would realize that they are being hostile and would probably not internalize the idea that you are stupid. You can dismiss your embarrassment at baldness in much the same way.Challenge your negative thoughts, as well. One reason you might feel embarrassed is that you agree with the \u201cconventional\u201d view of baldness \u2013 that it is somehow undesirable or unattractive. This sort of thinking can lead you to internalize the thoughts.;\n, Do away with \u201cconventional\u201d definitions of attractiveness, for one, and try to cultivate a healthier self-image. The media may show the ideal man one way, but there are many ways to be a strong and handsome man. You can adopt a different view.Don\u2019t compare yourself to others. Every individual has a unique makeup. It does no good to look at other men and envy them for their looks or fuller head of hair. The men you see in the movies and in magazines are also not entirely real, in that they have the benefit of things like cosmetic treatments and airbrushing.\nTake pride in things other than looks. Looks define you, but so do your talents, your interests, and your relationships. Find things that you like about yourself, like the fact that you have a fine baritone voice or are a great fullback on your soccer team.\nTake a break from mirrors. If you find yourself obsessing about your hair, take a break. Stop yourself from constantly checking your hair line in the rear-view mirror or in shop windows. In these moments, remind yourself of one of your great inner qualities., Your goal shouldn\u2019t just be toleration of how you look, but pride and acceptance. Remember that you are not alone. Baldness is a part of being male and there is no reason to let it control your emotions. In fact, one of the most powerful things you can do to combat hair loss is to not just live with it but embrace it \u2013 learn to love the bald.\n\n\nAccept it. 50 million men in the US have some amount of hair loss, and hair loss increases as we age. In fact, about 50% of men have some hair loss by age 50, while 80% experience it by age 70.Remind yourself of famous, powerful, and sexy bald men. What do Sean Connery, Patrick Stewart, Michael Jordan, Bruce Willis, and LL Cool J have in common? They are all bald \u2013 and they don\u2019t hide it.Keep in mind that some women find bald men very attractive. What many find especially attractive is confidence, though, whether a guy has hair or no.\n With thinning hair, you might be better shaving it off. According to one study, men with shaved heads were consistently rated as more masculine and dominant than those who tried to conceal hair loss, in addition to being rated as taller and stronger.By embracing baldness, you might actually appear more rather than less manly and attractive. Concealing thinning hair can be a big turn-off, as the concealment looks desperate and lacking in self-assurance., Try a hair style that shows your thinning hair to best advantage. The general rule is that short is better when it comes to balding men, whether you go crew cut or full cue ball.For one thing, close-cropped hairstyles give your hair a sense of added fullness and lift. They also makes existing bald spots less conspicuous and are much less expensive in the long-run than various concealment or treatments.\nShorter lengths like buzz cuts also exude confidence. They say to onlookers, \u201cYes, I\u2019m balding. So what?\u201d\n\n, The final way to embrace your baldness is to go beyond the close crop and shave everything off. It is conspicuous, it is self-confident, and it is a good option for men with large bald spots.Although you will have to razor your head every now and then, a clean shave on top means that you will never have to bother with washing and styling again. It is the ultimate in low maintenance hair.\nFor many men with the style, the shaved head has become a signature look. Consider Jordan, consider Captain Picard, consider Andre Agassi.\n You can also grow facial hair as a way to offset the loss up top and to direct attention down from your thinning pate. Adding a mustache, beard, or goatee can help to balance your face.\n\n\nFull goatees work well with thinning hair, for example, as do thick, handlebar mustaches.\nA full, bushy beard and shaved head is another bold look. If done properly, it can be extremely manly.\n\n"}

If you don't like the scent of your shampoo and conditioner, you can always spritz some body spray or perfume in it once it's dry.;\n, The steam opens your pores. Use a set that has a scrub, toner, and moisturizer. If you want, you can use a spot treatment to clear up zits. Always rinse with cool water. It closes your pores. NEVER rinse with really cold water, it can close your pores too tight and cause blackheads.\n To have a really fresh mouth, use these steps: mouthwash, toothpaste, floss, mouthwash. To make your breath feel even more fresh and clean, pop in a mint or chew some sugar-free gum.\n Wear something cute and clean. Never wear something that MIGHT be clean. It might smell clean, but it might not look clean or the other way around. Don't assume nobody will notice a small stain, even if you cover it up, someone will. A Tide-to-Go pen is great if you get a stain during the day, I highly recommend it. Never wear a revealing top AND revealing bottoms. It looks cheap. Wear one or the other. For shoes, flats are foolproof- comfortable and stylish. Try to have a basic pair of both brown and black, they go with practically everything. Heels can make you seem too old if you're very young and can be hard to walk in. If you're old enough, stick with two inches or lower for day, but if you want to go a little higher for a special occasion or night out, go ahead.\n Do it whichever way you want, as long as it looks well kept. Use hairspray, but not too much or it can backfire on you. Don't shampoo every day, all you'll get for your trouble is brittle ends and greasy roots, yuck! If you're hair gets greasy on the second or third day, however, dry shampoo is a handy thing to have. Heat styling ,may deliver best results for curling and straightening, but don't use these too often because they can fry your hair. Use a good heat protectant if you're using any kind of heat, even a blow dryer. I recommend the Tresemme Heat Taming Spray, it works wonders.\n Put on deodorant, lotion, body spray, perfume, etc. Try buying a set or relentless ones because to many scents make you smell like a walking perfume factory. Obviously, these things should be effective and in scents you like, but be careful with body spray and perfume during the day. Try a lighter or fruity scent so you don't knock out everybody in your lecture hall or office. Body sprays are generally less concentrated in smell than perfume, so it's better for the daytime. Whatever you do, don't use too much. Nobody likes being around a person whose perfume is so strong to where they can taste it, guys especially hate that. Just go easy on the scents, it's that simple.\n It's better to own a few nice pieces of jewelry than a bunch of cheap stuff you'll throw out within a month. If you need help on finding classic pieces or don't know what looks best on you, ask your mom or sister. Try to have one signature piece like a charm bracelet or ring that can go with anything. Charm bracelets are great because you can personalize them so its all your own, the Italian style ones are really nice. If you are going to use a bold statement accessory, be it a necklace, scarf, ring or whatever, keep the rest to a minimum. Wear pearls by day and diamonds by night. They don't have to be real, but they can't be plastic. In fact, steer clear of plastic, fake leather, (unless it's nice, I mean the cheap kind), and nickel.\n You don't HAVE to wear makeup, but if you do, make yourself look polished and use a natural look for every day. It doesn't have to be channel, but don't buy Chinese makeup. Walgreen has a surprisingly good selection of budget makeup. Most girls who wear makeup for the first time are clueless on how to wear it, so turn to an experienced person, magazines or YouTube tutorials for help. If you have a facial feature you like a lot, make it stand out and keep everything else subtle. NEVER do a dramatic eye AND a bold lip, it will make you look like a clown or a drag queen. Doing one or the other for special occasions can be very classy if done right. Mastering makeup takes practice, but once you've got the hang of it, there are no limits to what you can do. Eyeshadow and eyeliner are hard to master. For your first time, go with bold lip. You can never have to many lip products if you are a beginner.\n\n"}

If you barged ahead and sized up every other week, you most likely caused small tears and potentially ripped the delicate tissue of your holes. If you allowed them to heal for at least a month before sizing up, that will speed up the healing process and your ears will thank you.\n\nRemember never to stretch dry. Always use some kind of lube, like a special stretching balm, Vitamin E oil, or coconut oil. Stretching in or after a hot shower has been said to help with the stretching process. Also, tapers are not meant to be worn as jewelry, because the weight is uneven, so only use them for stretching. Don't use acrylic or silicone tapers; although acrylic tapers are the cheapest and easiest to find, acrylic can't be fully sterilized, and silicone tapers can cause blowouts due to trapped bacteria.;\n, For example, if your normal gauge is a 000 (10.4 mm), put a 00 (9.26 mm) in your ear.\n\n\nIf you have gone above a 12 mm g, it is unlikely that you will experience much shrinkage. This is because stretching your ears involves (surprise, surprise) stretching--you stretch the tissue of your ear and then allow it to heal. If blowouts, tearing or infections occur, scar tissue builds up which can sometimes keep ear lobes from shrinking back to normal once they have been stretched. Of course, everyone's body is different. Just be aware of the potential that your ears might not shrink back without surgery., You should wear the smaller gauge until your ear has shrunk down so that this gauge fits well. This may take only a few days for some people, and longer than a week for others.\n The smallest is a 17g (1.14 mm). Most wire earrings are .812 mm and studs are 1.02 mm."}

Create a circle of rocks or other natural elements if it seems appropriate to your ritual or practice.\n Once you start practicing, you're going to want to stay in the circle and not break the connection until your ritual is completed. If you start and you've forgotten a particular candle or totem that's important to you, getting up and hitting \"pause\" isn't an option. Gather everything you'll need to begin your ritual and start preparing for your ritual.\n\n\nIf you're going to offer something to a spirit, remember to include that and everything you'll need to prepare it.\nOther popular items to include in rituals include totems, black candles, crystals, knives, bells, bowls of salt and bowls of water. Organize them, whatever they are, to form an altar. Bring a surface to set them on, like a box or crate with a small black tablecloth. The altar should face north, as should you when you're in the circle completing your ritual.\n Place candles or other items at each cardinal direction. Do not light them yet. Some wiccans will choose something that represents Earth in the north, Air in the east, Fire in the south, and Water in the west. Follow whatever procedures are appropriate for the rituals you desire.\n\n\nSalt, a stone, or a green candle could represent Earth. Incense, broken glass, or a yellow candle could stand in for Air. Water in any receptacle is a fine representation of water, or a blue candle for Water. A red candle or cigarette does nicely for Fire. If you have one, you could also use the Aces in your Tarot deck.\n How you choose to use your circle once its cast is largely up to you, your practice, and your goals. In general, though, you'll want to start by blessing the space and clearing it of negative energy, beginning the invocation of spirits. Some covens are very formal and ritualized in their practice, while some less so. Do what feels natural.\n\n\nWalk around the circle, lighting the candles, leaving a trail of salt around the boundary. In each cardinal direction, recite an invocation like: \"Blessing upon the creatures and spirits of the North.\", Walk around the circle three times, saying: \"Cast the circle thrice about, to keep the evil spirits out.\"\n\n\n\"I conjure thee, O Circle of Power, that thou best a meeting place of love and joy and truth; a shield against all wickedness and evil; a boundary between men and the realms of the Mighty Ones; a rampart and protection that shall preserve and contain the power that we shall raise within thee.\", Call them to the objects that represent them. Take each of the objects that represent the elements around your circle, filling it with the power of each of them.\n\n\nMeditate for a while now. Meditation or astral projection might be the main act, or it serves just to shift your consciousness.\n Remember: \"And it harm none, do what ye will.\" If you must leave the circle before you are done, cut a doorway. Envision a doorway being cut from the edge of the circle, up, to the side, then down again. Reclose the circle once you're back in.\n"}

Most boards wrap back and forth, so you move left to right across first row, then move up to the second and move right to left, and so on.Follow the numbers on the board to see how to move forward. For example, if you rolled a five and you were on space number 11, then you would move your game piece to space number 16.;\n, Each player should roll one die to see who gets the highest number. Whoever rolls the highest number gets to take the first turn. After the first player takes a turn, the person sitting to that player\u2019s left will take a turn. Play continues in a circle going left.\n\n\nIf two or more people roll the same number, and it is the highest number rolled, each of those people roll the die an additional time to see who gets to go first.\n To take your turn, roll the die again and read the number that you rolled. Pick up your game piece and move forward that number of spaces. For example, if you roll a two, move your piece to square two. On your next turn, if you roll a five, move your piece forward five squares, ending up on square seven.Some people play that you can only move onto the board if you roll a one, and if you don't get a one, you just skip your turn. This isn't recommended, since this can be frustrating for unlucky players.\n The ladders on the game board allow you to move upwards and get ahead faster. If you land exactly on a square that shows an image of the bottom of a ladder, then you may move your game piece all the way up to the square at the top of the ladder.If you land at the top of a ladder or somewhere in the middle of a ladder, just stay put. You never move down ladders.\n Some versions have snakes on the board, while others have chutes (slides). Snakes (or chutes) move you back on the board because you have to slide down them. If you land exactly at the top of a snake or chute, slide your game piece all the way to the square at the bottom of the snake or chute.If you land on a square that is in the middle or at the bottom of a snake (or chute), just stay put. You only slide down if you land on the top square of a snake (or chute).\n If you roll a six, then you get an extra turn. First, move your piece forward six squares and then roll the die again. If you land on any snakes or ladders, follow the instructions above to move up or down and then roll again to take your extra turn. As long as you keep rolling sixes, you can keep moving!, The first person to reach the highest square on the board wins, usually square 100. But there's a twist! If you roll too high, your piece \"bounces\" off the last square and moves back. You can only win by rolling the exact number needed to land on the last square.For example, if you are on square 99 and roll a four, move your game piece to 100 (one move), then \"bounce\" back to 99, 98, 97 (two, three, then four moves.) If square 97 is a ladder base or snake head, climb or slide as usual.\n Having to land exactly on the final square makes the game more exciting, since it gives people a chance to catch up, but it can also make the game take too long. Instead, you can let people roll higher than they need to reach 100.\n\n\nFor a little more excitement, when someone reaches or passes 100, give each other player one turn to try to beat them. If someone would end up higher (such as 104 instead of 101), he wins. Two or more people can tie and win together this way, if they end up on the same square.\n Have each player play with two game pieces, each the same color so no one gets confused. When you roll the die, you can move one of your two pieces by that amount. You need to have both of your pieces reach the last square in order to win., In this variation, each player starts on square one. To take your turn, roll two dice instead of one. Choose one die and move your piece forward by that amount. With your remaining die, you can move another player forward by the amount on that die.For a much \"meaner\" variation, and potentially a much longer game, whenever you land exactly on the same square as another game piece, the piece that was already there moves all the way back to the beginning, and has to roll to get on the board again.\n Making your own Snakes and Ladders set is quite easy, as described in the tips. You can add your own touch by writing words, trivia questions, or other educational material in some or all of the squares. Here are some ideas:\n\n\nFor kids learning to read, write a simple word in each square. When a player moves his piece, he reads out each word he passes through.Use the snakes and ladders to teach good ideas and discourage bad ones.For example, a ladder could travel from \"I did my homework.\" to \"I got good grades.\" A snake could go from \"I didn't eat any fruits or vegetables today.\" to \"My stomach feels bad.\"\n\n"}

Because it makes the blade cut more efficiently, it seems sharper. But real sharpening uses specialty stones to actually fix the edge and doesn't need to be done regularly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoning needs to be done regularly. Some chefs hone every single time they use their knives. You should hone the blade immediately after any sharpening.\n\nSharpening can be done at home or professionally, and only needs to be done once or twice a year., Hold the rod from the top of the handle, with the end on the ground. You can put a dish towel underneath it to help keep it in place.\n This is not the angle you want to sharpen at, it is just a step to help you get the right angle. Start with the blade perpendicular to the rod, then pick your hand up to angle the blade down at a 45-degree angle to the rod.\n\n\nStart near the handle of the blade.\n This doesn't have to be precisely measured, but you should get used to this angle. If you're struggling, just think about being roughly halfway to 45-degrees. Remember that the blade is pointing down to the counter, not up., Keeping the blade at this 20-degree angle, draw the blade back towards you on a straight line. You should only need 4-5 passes if you hone the blade regularly, but 8-10 if you haven't done it in a while.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou want to use gentle, fluid pressure through each draw. Making it a quick, even motion will help.\n In order to center the blade, you need to hone both sides the same number of times.\n You'll notice the grooves on the rod becoming smooth, and it won't actually help you much anymore.

Try washing it once a week. Switch to once every two or three weeks if your hair starts to break easily.\n\n\nTry to find a shampoo that doesn't leave your hair feeling too dry.\nTo reduce damage, wash hair in lukewarm water and rinse in cool water.\n The heat from blow drying can cause damage, leading your hair to break before it grows to the desired length. Instead, plait your hair, wrap it in a silk scarf, and let dry overnight. Alternatively, towel dry your hair by wrapping it in a towel and simply rubbing your head for a while.\n Restore these with conditioner suited for African hair. Periodically deep condition your hair as well.\n\n\nYou can use leave-in conditioner in between washes.\n Rub natural oil into the middle and ends of your hair to make it soft and supple. This will help prevent it breaking before it grows too long. Jamaican oil, castor oil, Moroccan oil, or lavender oil are all good options.\n\n\nCovering your hair with a satin scarf can help your hair take in the oil.\n Water strengthens dry hair and may stimulate your hair roots. You can apply water, moisturizing conditioner, or a mixture of half olive oil or half coconut oil. For extra moisture, apply each one, in that order. The oil will help seal in the moisture.\n\n\nIf you use gel or mousse in your hairstyle, try hair jam instead. This will hold your hair, then eventually melt into oils to add shine and moisture.\n These can strengthen some types of hair, but may damage dry hair. Try brushing your hair: if your strands stretch significantly before breaking, you may need more protein.\n\n\nDo not leave in protein conditioner longer than instructed on the label, or it may turn hard and brittle.\n About every other day or when your scalp feels dry, apply coconut grease to the tip of your pointer finger. Apply at the top of your part and sweep back until all the grease has been applied.\n\n\nStop if you notice dandruff, as oil can feed the fungus that causes it.\nIf you have a perm, grease only once a week, or apply hot oil instead.\n Once a month, use a neutralizing shampoo to clean all products out of your hair. If you use a lot of sprays, gels, and other styling products, use it every other week.\n\n"}

{"title": "How to Tenderize Chicken3", "summary": "pick your cooking method.\ndo not overcook the bird.\ntry a \"low and slow\" cooking method.\nallow the meat to rest after cooking.", "article": " There are many ways to cook chicken, but here are a few examples:\n\nBlackening the chicken: Take a pan, put 1 tbsp (30 mL) oil (olive oil adds extra flavor!!) and heat up the oil. Meanwhile, season the chicken using whatever spices you like. Cover the chicken with the spices, and then place in the pan. Cook until no longer pink on the inside.\nOven-baking the chicken: Season chicken and place in a greased baking pan. Bake 30-40 minutes, or until no longer pink.\nGrilling the chicken: Transfer the tenderized,seasoned chicken to the grill and cook until done.\nStewing the chicken: In a proper stew, it is virtually impossible to produce tough chicken. This is one of the many reasons chicken stews of various types are found throughout the world. This can use both plain or marinated cuts of chicken.\n Overcooking can lead to loss of moisture and proteins tightening up into bubblegum consistency. Experience will help you judge when chicken is done, but even professional cooks will still test with a thermometer to be certain. Test the temperature of the bird using a meat thermometer to determine whether it has reached the correct internal temperature. For most cuts of chicken, this will be 165\u00a0\u00b0F (74\u00a0\u00b0C).\n\n\nUse a probe thermometer when cooking a whole bird, plunged into the deepest part of the breast. Use an instant read for smaller cuts like breasts and thighs.\n Though seemingly contradictory to the \"do not overcook\" warning, low, slow cooking breaks down proteins, allowing for a more tender experience. This type of cooking also allows time for flavors and juices to penetrate into the meat, giving even more juiciness. It works best with bone-in thighs and other dark meat, or you could roast an entire chicken this way., Cover it with heavy-duty aluminum foil and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute in the meat. If you cut it right away, the juices are more likely to drain out immediately instead of reabsorbing into the meat. This is especially important for whole roasted chicken or roasted chicken parts.\n\n\nWhile this advice is absolutely true, be assured that carving right away will also not take your succulent chicken into a dry mess of a meal.\nIt also makes sense to wait until the chicken is cool enough to handle, anyway. A chicken just out of the oven is too hot to cut into without risking burns. Chicken that hot will also burn when bitten into.\n\n"}

In addition to helping with twitching, you can use the exercise to keep eye muscles strong., Use the above image to locate the acupressure points around your eye. Massage each point lightly in a circular motion for 5-10 seconds before moving to the next. Once you finish the sequence, start again from the beginning. Repeat for approximately two minutes.For a similar acupressure technique, place your index and middle fingers on your eyebrows. Press gently and rotate them on the edges of your eye socket bone for five minutes.Acupressure methods help eye twitching by increasing circulation to the eye while the closed lid allows tear film to hydrate the eye.\nTo prevent irritation or infection, ensure your hands and face are clean first.\n Alternate between splashing your closed eyes with cold and then warm water. The cold water will constrict blood vessels, and the warm water will dilate the same vessels.This process will help increase circulation and blood flow to the eye, which can help with twitching.\n\n\nYou can also run a wet ice cube over the eyelid before splashing with warm water as opposed to alternating between warm and cold water. Repeat the process 7-8 times.\n\n"}

That doesn't mean you should hunch over (although this will work with some high fashion shots). If you're standing, put uneven weight on your feet, and the leg with less weight will naturally bend a little. You'll look more comfortable and your posture will appear more natural. Don't slouch so much, though, that it makes your stomach look bigger.\n\n\nBy \"slouch,\" we mean \"be natural.\" Most people aren't aware they're slouching when they are, so don't take your natural slouch and multiply it. Think casually, but with your head high. You want to elongate your neck as much as possible. Imagine a string holding up your forehead.;\n, Your entire body needs to have life to it. Think of a dancer -- not a single part of her body isn't engaged while she's dancing, even if she's standing in position. No part of you should be a limp noodle!\n\n\nStart by engaging your core (this will help suck you in, too) and then engage your limbs. \"Strong\" doesn't mean aggressive or masculine in this context -- it just means with conviction or with energy. You want to convey a feeling through the camera, after all!\n\n, For a more interesting shot, make sure that you're doing something different with each side of your body. You can be dramatic and do something totally different with each of your limbs and tilt your head to the side, if it matches the feel of the shoot. Being asymmetrical can be as simple as dipping one shoulder or hip, making sure that your arms are at different heights, or bending one leg a little (or a lot) more than the other.\n\n\nRemember: You're part of a picture. This photo isn't about how gosh dang pretty you are -- it's about the aestheticism of the photo. Even with the best make-up and hair in the world, if you don't create pleasing angles, the photo won't be as stellar as it could be.\n Looking at the camera straight on can work in some dramatic shots, but generally it's better to put your face at an angle, and look at the camera from that angle. Tilt your nose a little up or down, a little left or right, but keep your gaze on that camera.\n\n\nLearn which angles flatter your face the most. Do you have a great jawline? Tilt your head up and to the side a little. Experiment in front of a mirror or with your own camera to see which angles make the most interesting shots on your face.\nKnow which direction the light is coming from. Remember that light will cast shadows, and even if they are slight, they will affect the appearance of your face. If light is coming from the top, tilting your nose down may cause your browbone to cast a shadow over your eyes, which is good if you're going for a sinister shot, but not good if you're trying to look friendly.\n While an interesting shot can be had by looking at the camera, you have many more options if you look elsewhere. What's going on over there? Is she staring in the mirror? Does she see a leprechaun? Is she talking to the Queen of England? Everyone will want to know.\n\n\nBe careful of the clich\u00e9d, staring-off-into-the-distance look. At best you'll look existential and at worse you'll look like you're trying to be existential by staring off into the distance. Use this gaze minimally.\n Kinda like the last tip just eluded to, quartering out will make you look as slim as possible. Is she facing forward? Is she facing to the side? Just how wide is her waist? NO ONE WILL KNOW. Stick to a 3/4 angle to appear the slimmest.\n\n\nGoing head-on into anything will make you the most vulnerable and exposed (that goes for real life, too!). If you quarter out, which side is your good side? Emphasize that one to get the best photo.\n Possibly the most awkward part of modeling is knowing what to do with your hands. They're just there hanging awkwardly. If you stay engaged head to toe, though, hopefully you'll find poses that feel right, that make sense. The only thing you should not do, is put them around your face. Hello, bad 1980s glamour shot!\n\n\nA good rule of thumb is to show the side of your hand. This creates the longest, thinnest line extending from your arm. It also avoids the are-my-hands-aging fear and the do-my-palms-look-funny worry.\n\n"}

He or she should leave the room when you seem to be in a relaxed, drowsy state. Further intervention could keep you awake.\n After establishing your mind in a visualized comfort zone and you feel that your mind is in fact disconnecting from your body, you're ready to begin falling asleep. The anxious thoughts that might have bothered your mind without hypnosis have been silenced, and as a result, it is likely your dreams will be less disturbing and your sleep will be deeper.\n\n\nIf you're doing this in the evening, your body will already be feeling the need for sleep. Do not fight this feeling! It is an indication that the hormone melatonin is being released into your body, a facilitator in falling asleep.Stage one of sleep includes dozing off because our brain waves and muscle activity are slowing down.Hypnosis pairs perfectly with this stage because you are purposefully slowing down your brain activity and telling your muscle activity to cease.\nUnderstand that our bodies don't switch on and off between sleeping and wakefulness. It takes time for your brain to gradually shut down. That is why you are undergoing hypnosis.\n If you struggle with insomnia, hypnosis might take some time to work. If you are not a highly hypnotic person, it may also take a few days of practice before you are willing to let go and get into a trance.\n\n\nIf you follow a sleep routine, your body will learn to take its cues from your activities. Your brain will trigger sleep hormones and be more willing to fall asleep.\nIf you don't have a hypnosis partner every night, you can walk yourself through some of the guided imagery alone, such as getting to your favorite place and doing the breathing exercises.\n\n"}

Most models are from 24 to 27 inches (61 to 68.6 cm) wide, and from 70 to 75 inches (177.8 to 190.5 cm) high.;\n,, Any compact washer and dryer can be purchased separately and stacked on top of one another, but that may not be safe. Make sure you select a model that is labeled as stackable. Washers are typically on the bottom of the unit, with dryers on the top.\n When buying a stackable washer and dryer, make sure you can reach the dryer. Practice opening and reaching into the dryer to make sure loading and unloading laundry will be easy. If you cannot find a stackable unit that you can reach, consider getting a small stool to help you reach into the dryer.\n Stackable models come with washers that load in the front of the machine, or on top of the machine. Front loading washing machines spin faster, which takes more water out of the clothing and linens, cutting down on drying time.\n The sensor detects the amount of moisture in the load, and will shut off automatically when the load is dry. The price will be higher than models with a thermostat sensor, which will measure air temperature in the drum of the dryer. However, the moisture sensor will save energy and help protect your laundry from extra wear and tear.\n If conservation and green energy is important to you, choose a model that has an Energy Star rating. If you like to do a lot of small loads of laundry, make sure you select a model that has low settings as well as high or heavy-load settings. Other considerations that depend on your preference include the placement of the lint screen in the dryer, the buzzer or bell that alerts you that the drying is complete, the simplicity of adding detergent and bleach to the washer, and how noisy the machine is when it is running.\n Stackable washers and dryers can be purchased in home appliance stores, major department stores, and at home improvement centers and warehouse chains. You can also find deals online, at major retailing sites. If you are on a budget, consider checking Craigslist in your area for a used model.\n Most stackable washer and dryer units come with a standard 1 year warranty. Extended warranties are often available, but they can be expensive.\n Before you buy a stackable washer and dryer, look for reviews provided by customers who currently own one.

The method's defenders claim that it has a roughly 75% success rate, though many doctors and researchers question its effectiveness.Nevertheless, the method remains attractive to some expectant parents because of its relative cheapness (at $600-$1200 per attempt) compared to other techniques. If you wish to use this method, your first step is to find and contact a clinic licensed to perform the Ericsson method.\n\n\nA list of Ericsson-licensed clinics can be found on the website of Gametrics Ltd., a company founded by the method's developer and lead proponent, Dr. Ronald Ericsson. Six clinics in the U.S. are licensed to perform the procedure, as well as five clinics outside the U.S. These five are in Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Colombia, and Egypt.\n The Ericsson method involves the father giving a sperm sample, that sample being processed, and the mother being artificially inseminated in a single appointment. To ensure the best possible chance of pregnancy, the appointment must be made on the day that the mother is scheduled to be ovulating. You will be asked to provide this information when scheduling an appointment.\n\n\nThe Ericsson method takes about four hours to complete, so ensure that both the mother and the father have reserved plenty of free time on the day of ovulation and can attend the appointment together.\n Upon arriving at the clinic on the day of the woman's ovulation, the man gives a sperm sample. This sperm is used to inseminate the mother. Generally, a man's sperm count is highest after 2-5 days without ejaculation,so you may be asked by the clinic to abstain from any sexual activity for about 48 hours before your appointment.\n Once the father provides his sperm sample, the sperm is placed in a vial of a type of protein called albumin. Sperm can swim through albumin, but the Ericsson method assumes that male sperm, which are smaller, weaker, and faster than female sperm, can pass through the albumin quicker. This means that, after waiting for the sperm to swim from the top of the vial to the bottom of the vial, the sperm near the bottom will (supposedly) be mostly male, while the sperm near the top will be mostly female.\n\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of this process has been called into question many times.Some studies have found that albumin produces no noticeable separation of male and female sperm. Other studies (whose results have sometimes been called into question) purport about a 75% success rate., To try for a male child, staff at the clinic will take a sample of sperm from the bottom of the vial of albumin and artificially inseminate the mother with this sperm. At this, point, hopefully, the woman conceives. As with normal sexual intercourse, however, pregnancy is not guaranteed from a single exposure to sperm.\n\n\nThere are several different methods of artificial insemination in use, but the most common is Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI). In this method, sperm are injected via a catheter directly into the uterus.\n Just like it can be difficult for a woman to achieve pregnancy through ordinary sex, it can also be difficult for a woman to become pregnant from artificial insemination. Though the chances of pregnancy naturally vary with a woman's age and health, in general, most sources rate the success rate of Intra Uterine Insemination at about 5-20% per cycle.Because of this, it is a very real possibility that multiple attempts may be needed to achieve pregnancy.\n\n\nNote that the use of fertility medications can increase the chance of pregnancy.\nThough the Ericsson method is generally cheaper than many other fertility-related procedures at $600-$1200 per attempt,the fact that success is not guaranteed from a few attempts means that the total cost may be significantly higher. Be aware of this before scheduling this treatment.\n Before pursing the Ericsson method as a way to improve your chances of conceiving a boy, it's important to make sure that you have reasonable expectations to avoid serious disappointment. As discussed above, the process can take multiple attempts to produce a pregnancy. In addition, the actual effectiveness of this method is a subject of debate \u2014 many researchers question its ability to reliably produce children of the desired sex. Finally, even when taking the most charitable attitude towards the Ericsson method possible, it's worth noting that even the method's supporters acknowledge that it won't work all of the time. Generally, proponents of the method suggest about a 75% success rate.\n\n\nIt's also important to know that some clinics offering the Ericsson method have been found to have made deceptive claims regarding the method's effectiveness, although this is not necessarily true at all locations."}

Continue to ask for brief recaps at the beginning of your workouts, however.\n This homework can be something like a workout plan, writing down a food journal, or even simple goals like, \u201cEat vegetables every day.\u201d Most clients will genuinely want to complete their assignment successfully, so this can be extremely motivating.\n\n\nWhen you assign this \u201chomework,\u201d give them the opportunity to decide if it seems realistic and manageable. If they tell you that they will be able to complete it, hold them to it.\n There are several ways that they can do this. The free iPhone app MyFitnessPal allows users to log their food intake and exercise, and it also can give your client a forum to speak to other people on a fitness journey through extensive discussion boards and comment features. Encourage them to attend a certain workout class regularly or recruit friends to become gym buddies. The more people they have around them cheering them on, the more motivated they will be to stick with it and see progress.\n\n"}

One way to do so is to spend a few years working in an existing promotion company to learn the ropes and establish contacts. This will allow you to witness a number of large promotional campaigns from inception to end and build your experience, as well as your professional network. You will also avoid assuming any personal financial risk for shows when you work with a large company.\n\n\nHowever, working with a large company is not the only path to success. You can also start with an artist or set of small events and then build your career from there.\nWorking on your own places you in charge, with all of the associated risks and rewards that come from that.;\n, Some promotion companies specialize in entertainer promotions, while others specialize in branding and promoting products or companies. Determine whether you want to focus on event coordination, television and radio guest appearances, marketing materials and distribution, or ticket sales. You can also offer all of these services as a comprehensive package if you have the right connections.\n\n\nYou can also start in one area in which you can find work and expand from there as your career progresses.\nFor example, it is relatively easier to get work producing promotional materials than as an event promoter. Once you have established yourself with effective marketing materials, you can branch out from there., Look for other promotion companies in your area that serve your chosen niche. If there are major promotion companies in your area that cover one specific area, you may have to reassess your strategy and choose a niche that still has potential for a new player. You can then look at similar companies' pricing models so that you can figure out a pricing strategy for your own., This will not only serve as a blueprint for the start up of your promotion company, but also as a reference tool to periodically review your company's performance. Include your investment costs, client acquisition strategy, business associates, and projected income for the first two or three years of operation.\n\n\nYou also need to include your startup costs, services offered, and strategies utilized.\nYour strategy section might include, for example, a timeline of your preparations made before an event.\nWrite in a marketing analysis section that includes your target demographic, an analysis of the industry, and an assessment of the local market for your services., Luckily, starting a promotion company does not require a large amount of startup money. You can easily work from home with a laptop and phone in the beginning if you're willing to meet with clients at their location. You may also need a varying amount of money to buy promotional materials, pay venue advance payments, and for other incidental expenses, depending on your services offered. If you are printing promotional materials, you will also need a printer or money to pay a printing service.\n\n\nReduce your capital needs by looking for venues without large advance deposits, working on word-of-mouth advertising, and keeping ad spending low., Register with you city using a doing business as (DBA) name. You'll receive a business license, after which you can legally start doing business. Check with your local chamber of commerce to see if there are any special permits or licenses you need. If you are founding an actual company, like an LLC or partnership, you will need to decide on a structure for it. You'll then have to file articles of organization with your state to officially register the company.You may also be responsible for signing up to collect state sales tax and for buying insurance coverage. Check with your local branch of the Small Business Administration (SBA) for more information., Buy a computer and a phone that you can use for business purposes. Make sure to use a dedicated phone for business purposes, rather than just using your cell phone. If you need any other office or production equipment, be sure to purchase them as cheaply as possible to reduce your startup costs., You will need to have a network of industry professionals that you can use to support your events or create materials for you, particularly if you intend to offer a full suite of services. Make a list of contractors such as printers, caterers, event organizers, and luxury limo services. Look through reviews and local listings to find the best services. Their professional service and products will make your promotion company look good as well., Set up a website with links to your social media profiles on social networks so clients can always reach you. Make sure your website looks professional, as potential customers can be quickly turned off by an amateurish or unhelpful one. On social media, make profiles for your business that are separate from your personal profiles. Then, fill them with posts and content that reflect your \"brand.\" Update your profile pictures, information, and other profile features regularly as changes as required. Make sure to keep your image consistent across platforms as well., Make sure to have them on you at all times. You never know when you might meet an artist or event planner in need of a promoter. Make sure that your business cards are professional, contain all of your up-to-date contact information, and are eye-catching or otherwise memorable., Market your promotion company with email campaigns to potential customers, flyers, posters, and ads in trade magazines or entertainment magazines. Remembering to keep your marketing strategies within the bounds of what you can afford. In addition, focus your advertising towards your target customer. For example, a promotion company specializing in rap music concert promotion should not advertise on the classical music radio station., A large part of any type of promotion is utilizing your network to get work and to generate hype for your events. The first step of building a network is to impress people and companies that you work with or for. Make yourself valuable and they will remember you the next time they need promotional work done. Then, make sure to regularly stay in touch with your past customers. You also need a network of dependable support companies, like caterers or printers., Now that your business is set up, you'll need to work with your first clients to get started. If you can't find any work, try looking for a church or local nonprofit that needs promotion services. You may not get paid, but you can make connections and get a chance to showcase your skills. In any case, remember that you'll need to start small and prove yourself before big jobs will start rolling in. Consider partnering with an existing company to gain reputability and experience., As time goes on and you earn more lucrative jobs, you can expand your operations by offering new services or hiring additional employees. You may also choose to branch out into other markets, such as a different genre of music or different kind of event. You can also expand into different regions or even internationally. Just make sure to establish contacts in the new area first so that you can better understand the market there."}

Set the potatoes in a bowl and cover them with cold water.Using three potatoes will give you two servings of the garlic fries. If you want to make a larger batch, you can easily double or triple the ingredients. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll likely have to fry the potatoes in batches, though, because they won\u2019t all fit in the deep fryer at the same time.\nIf you prefer thicker or thinner fries, you can adjust the size of the strips that you cut the potatoes into. Thicker fries will take longer to fry, while thinner fries will require less time to become golden brown.;\n, Once you\u2019ve covered the potatoes with the water, leave them to soak for at least 20 minutes. That will help remove some of the excess starch so the interior of the fries will be fluffier when they\u2019re finished frying.If you have the time, soaking the potatoes for 2 to 3 hours will result in the fluffiest fries. You can even place the bowl with the potatoes in the fridge and soak them overnight.\n When the potatoes are finished soaking, remove them from the bowl. Run them under the cold water from the sink to rinse them off and set them down on a large baking sheet or other platter.Rinsing the fries is an important step because some of the starch may still be present on the potatoes. Running them under the water helps remove any lingering residue.\n With the potatoes in a single, even layer, use a clean kitchen towel or paper towels to dry the fries. Pat gently on both sides to make sure that the potatoes are completely dry.To ensure that they fry up crisply, make sure that the potatoes are completely dry.\n When you\u2019re ready to fry the French fries, it\u2019s important to preheat the deep fryer. Fill the fryer with peanut or canola oil according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Turn the heat to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully heat.You don\u2019t need a table top deep fryer to make the fries. Heat 3- to 4-inches of the oil in a heavy-bottomed stock pot or Dutch oven, and use a deep-fry or candy thermometer to monitor the temperature until it reaches 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).\nWhile peanut and canola oils both work for frying the potatoes, peanut oil is usually the best option because it has the highest smoke point.\n While the deep fryer is preheating, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of extra virgin olive oil to a medium skillet. Turn the burner to medium, and allow the oil to heat for approximately 5 minutes, or until it begins to shimmer., Once the oil is heated, mix 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic into the skillet. Allow the garlic to cook for about a minute, or until it is an even golden brown all over.If you want the fries to have an even stronger garlic flavor, you can increase the amount of cloves to suit your tastes.\nMake sure to swirl, shake, or stir the garlic as it\u2019s heating so it cooks evenly.\nGarlic can burn very quickly, so it\u2019s very important to keep a close eye on it. If it seems like it\u2019s browning too quickly, lower the heat.\n When the garlic has become golden brown, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the skillet. Set it down on a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil.The oil that\u2019s left in the skillet will be infused with the flavor of the garlic. You may want to save it to use it in another recipe, such as a salad dressing.\n When the deep fryer is preheated, transfer the fries to its basket. Carefully lower the potatoes into the hot oil.Because the oil will be extremely hot, make sure to lower the basket into the fryer very slowly. If you splash the oil on your skin, you will likely get burned.\nIf you aren\u2019t using a deep fryer, place the French fries directly in the oil in the pot in a single layer.\n Allow the potatoes to cook in the oil until they are golden brown, which should take 7 to 8 minutes. Shake the basket periodically to ensure that they cook evenly.If you are frying the potatoes in a pot, use a metal slotted spoon to move the fries around to ensure that they cook evenly.\nYou can also bake the fries if you prefer. Toss the potatoes with some olive oil, salt, and pepper, and place them in a single layer on a large greased baking sheet. Cook them in an oven preheated to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius) for about 30 minutes or until browned. Turn the heat up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius), and bake for another 5 minutes., When the French fries are finished cooking, lift the basket out of the oil and allow them to drain for a minute or so. Next, transfer the fries to a platter or baking sheet lined with paper towel to absorb the excess oil., After the fries are drained but still warm, place them in a large bowl. Add the cooked garlic, kosher salt to taste, and 2 tablespoons (3 g) of finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, and toss together so the fries are fully coated.You can substitute curly parsley for the flat-leaf if you prefer.\nIf you want to add some cheesy flavor to the fries, you can add \u00bc cup (25 g) of grated Parmesan in with the garlic, salt, and parsley.\n Once the fries are coated with the garlic mixture, transfer them to a serving platter. The fries are delicious on their own, but you can serve them with a dipping sauce, such as a Parmesan aioli or your favorite ketchup."}

You can cross multiply in this direction first; it really doesn't matter as long as you multiply both numerators by the denominators diagonal from them.\n Just set 26 equal to 10x. 26 = 10x. It doesn't matter which number you list first; since they're equal, you can swap them from one side of the equation to the other with impunity, as long as you treat each term as a whole.\n\n\nSo, if you're trying to solve 2/x = 10/13 for x, you'd have 2 * 13 = x * 10, or 26 = 10x.\n Now that you're working with 26 = 10x, you can start by finding a common denominator and dividing both 26 and 10 by a number that divides evenly into both numbers. Since they are both even, you can divide them by 2; 26/2 = 13 and 10/2 = 5. You're left with 13 = 5x. Now, to isolate x, divide both sides of the equation by 5. So, 13/5 = 5/5, or 13/5 = x. If you'd like the answer in decimal form, you can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 10 to get 26/10 = 10/10, or 2.6 = x.\n\n"}

You will be asked to appear in person at the local pr\u00e9fecture to undergo a simple medical examination and to complete your resident application.Once this is complete, you will be granted your resident permit (carte de s\u00e9jour) which will be good for one year, regardless of how long your visa has been granted for.\nYou may need to bring additional documents to your OFII appointment, but they will notify you ahead of time.\nYou can\u2019t submit your OFII paperwork until after you have already arrived in France.\n If you\u2019re going to be living in France permanently, you should consider opening a bank account at a French institution. This will save you from possibly hefty international transaction fees from using your foreign bank account and bank card while living in France.To do so, you\u2019ll need to bring your passport and proof of residency in France. This could be a copy of your rental agreement or something from your school if you are studying in France.\nYou will probably have to wait a week or so for your French bank card to arrive in the mail.\nSome common banks to use in France include LCL, BNP Paribas, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Banque Populaire, and La Banque Postale.\n If you\u2019re living in France, you (and your children) are entitled to free education. School is mandatory from ages 6 to 16, so your kids will need to be enrolled.To enroll your children for the first time, you\u2019ll need to contact the service des \u00e9coles at your local courthouse (or mairie, in French). They will help you find the school nearest your residence that your child should attend.\nYou may also consider an international school for your child, especially if they don\u2019t speak French, to ease the transition. However, this type of school may not be free.\n\n"}

What do you need your friend to know?\nOnce you have your outline, practice speaking in the mirror.\nYou can always bring the outline with you if you think you may forget an important point.\n No matter how you go about it, the important thing is just to say what you need to say.

Press it against your chest, to hold it securely., If your rabbit isn\u2019t socialized and resists being held, you might need to hold it somewhat tightly against you. However, if your bunny is cooperative, you can reduce its stress levels by holding it more gently against you., When you are done with your rabbit, slowly bring it closer to the ground by squatting. Do not lean over and drop your rabbit suddenly.

Either tie up your horse outside the stall or put it out on pasture.\nRemove the manure with the pitchfork and place the manure in the wheelbarrow. Sift the bedding through the pitchfork to minimize how much bedding you need to replace.\nClean the water bucket with clean water and a scrub brush.\nFor an intensive cleaning, remove everything from the stall to sweep and disinfect the floors and walls.

If you're a teen, you may have limited experience with resume format. Whatever choices you make, keep them consistent throughout.\n\n\nMake choices about how to outline your experience. Resumes usually list your job titles followed by explanations of your tasks. You can use short paragraphs or bullet points to explain experience, but you should keep the method you use consistent throughout. If you explain your duties for one job in paragraph form, all your job duties should be listed that way.Certain parts of a resume will be in bold or italics to draw attention to a job title, school, or work place. Make sure any choices you make about highlighting words are consistent. For example, say you choose to list one of your jobs like this: Server, Emma's Grill. For the remainder of your resume, you should have your job titles in bold and the name of your workplaces in italics.\nFont size and spacing should also be unified throughout. For example, you can always use size 12 font to list a job title, and size 10 for your place of work and job descriptions.;\n, In general, your resume should not go over a single page. Sometimes, people who've been in the same field long term may have a lengthier resume that goes over a single page but as a teen you're likely just starting out in the industry so you should keep you resume to a page., You need to choose a format for your resume. Resumes are designed in a variety of ways and there are no hard and fast rules for formatting. However, any choice you make should be easy to read for potential employers.\n\n\nAll resumes should include a heading at the top that includes your name and basic contact information. The text here should be bigger than the other text on the page.\nResume fonts should be professional in appearance and easy to read. Overly flashy, cursive fonts are a bad idea for resumes. Stick to fonts like Calibri, Arial, Georgie, Times New Roman, and other easy to read, formal fonts.Color can be used lightly in a resume and may help yours stand out. You can add color to headings like \"Experience,\" \"Education,\" and \"Additional Skills.\" However, the color should be darker shades of primary colors like deep blues and purples. Avoid difficult to read shades, like yellows, or flashy, neon colors like lime greens and hot pinks.\nSome resumes, especially if you work in a creative field, may use more creative formatting. Browsing creative resumes on Pinterest and Flickr can give you ideas of a unique format. However, you should strive to keep your resume readable and professional above anything else. Also, as a teen you may be lacking experience and a potential employer may look more harshly on a creatively designed resume as they may see it as a way to hide a small work history., All resumes should include certain basic contact information. Make sure you include the following information somewhere near the top of your resume:\n\n\nInclude your name, which should be written in larger print than other parts of the resume. You want your name to be somewhere at the top of the page, serving as a header above the other text.Below your name, include your address, home phone number, and e-mail address. Use a professional sounding e-mail, that uses your full name instead of a nickname or something informal. You should also make sure any voice mail greetings you have on your phone are professional in case you miss a call regarding a job., While objectives are getting less and less popular for resumes, if you're a teen it's still a good idea to include a few sentences about your career goals.\n\n\nAn objective should come in the form of a 2 to 3 line paragraph that states what you want to do professional and why you would be good at it.Try to be as specific as possible. Avoid statements like, \"My goal is to obtain a position in my chosen field. I want to use my skills and education to further my experience. I am a hard worker.\" This does not really tell your employer anything specific about you. Ask yourself, \"What are my specific skills? What can I bring to this position?\" As the more specific the better, it's a good idea to quickly rewrite your objective for each job you apply to, catering it to that employer's specific wants and needs.For example, say you've always been interested in politics and are trying to get a summer internship with a political campaign. A good objective for that job would be something like, \"I am a longtime campaign volunteer with 3 years of experience with campaign work. I am looking to break into a political career path by furthering my experience with fundraising, advertising, and general campaign management.\", As teens frequently have little experience beyond their high school education, include a section outlining our education on the top of your resume.\n\n\nStart with your most recent school and work your way back. However, you should not go all the way back to elementary school. Just list your college, if you're enrolled, and your high school education.If you've accrued any honors during high school or college, it's a good idea to list them. Things like the honors roll, honors college, or Dean's list speak to a strong work ethic. If you have a particularly high GPA, you might want to list that too., Oftentimes, teens have yet to have a real job or their work experience is very limited. However, there are ways to creatively present work experience in a way that displays a strong skill set even if work experience is limited.\n\n\nList formal or informal volunteer work, babysitting, or any gardening, dog walking, or other chores you may have done for relatives or neighbors for money. Even if these are not highly formal jobs that require a large skill set, the fact you performed them on a somewhat regular basis speaks to a strong work ethic and good time management skills.Low wage, part time jobs may not seem like much, but mentioning things like waitressing or retail work can look good if you highlight how such jobs helped you with interpersonal communication. Focus on how you talked to and assisted customers and the vast amount of information you had to manage.\n Make use of resume \"buzz words\" when you list the jobs you have held. Buzz words are words used on resumes to make work experience appear impressive to help catch an employer's eye.\n\n\nOnline, you can find lists of resume buzzwords that will help up your chances of getting the job you want. Things like classified, analyzed, facilitated, collected, assessed, calculated, trained, and designed are just a small example of the kinds of words that look great on a resume.Using buzzwords can make jobs seem impressive and emphasize the transferable skills you gained from basic labor jobs. If you waitress on the weekend in high school, a good bullet point for your job description might be \"Interacted politely with multiple customers on a nightly basis, maintaining a positive public image for the business.\"\nSpecifics are also important. Employers love it when tasks are quantified. Say you're a junior in high school and spent the summer tutoring middle school students in math. Instead of saying \"Tutored students each week,\" can be worded in a more impressive manner and in a way that quantifies your work. For example, \"Tutored a rotating group of 6 to 7 students on a bi-weekly basis, conveying concepts of basic algebra and geometry in an age-appropriate manner.\", While you may be spotty on actual job experience, having a section titled something like \"Achievements and Honors\" can help you highlight impressive non-work related information.\n\n\nIf you've ever won any contests or excelled in an extracurricular activity, this would be a great thing to add in a resume.Being the captain of a team, playing a sport, having a band, or operating a blog with appropriate content are all things that are impressive to employers as they show a capacity for leadership and initiative.If you're a college student, list any scholarships you received. Putting emphasis on high grades and good study skills shows that you're a hard worker and would apply yourself to a job if hired., References are a great thing to include on a resume for a teenager. As experience might be lacking, having a couple of people vouch for your work ethic is vital to setting yourself apart.\n\n\nReferences should be people who can speak to your skill set. Choose teachers, former bosses, people you've worked with volunteering, coaches, music instructors, or even a family friend who's known you for a long time.You should avoid listing friends or relatives, as this can look unprofessional., If your experience is limited, there are ways to emphasis your work ethic anyway. Employers may be hesitant to hire inexperienced workers, but they may take a chance on you if you appear to be a hard worker.\n\n\nFocus on your academic achievements. If you have not had a lot of practical experience but where a high achiever in terms of grades and test scores, this may impress an employer.Are you proficient with any software? Many college or high school courses cover softwares that may be important for certain jobs. If you're proficient in something like Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator, list that here.If you speak a second language, this can also impress employers. Even just having conversational skills in Spanish or French due to high school courses can look good on a resume., A good resume should be free of spelling and grammatical errors. Make sure you proofread carefully. You should also have someone else read over your resume for you to make sure you caught all the errors. Sometimes, if you're working on a document for a long time you tend to get typo blind and miss obvious errors., You should not send out the same resume for every job you applied to. Try to tailor your resume to fit a variety of positions. If you're applying for a basic labor job, keep in your experience with things like waitressing and yard work. If you're applying for an internship, shift focus to volunteer experience, academic achievement, and relevant coursework.\n\n"}

Underline evidence that you find questionable. This will be useful if you want to argue that the author\u2019s thesis is wrong.\nAnnotations on works of literature usually identify plot, character, and theme. However, they can also include setting, vocabulary and figurative language.\nIf you are reading for pleasure, highlight points that you found very interesting and that you might want to go back to. Consider, for example, annotating quotes that you really like and might want to use later. In addition, if you run across a big idea that changes the way you think, highlight it so that you can return to it.;\n, Successful annotation is only possible if you are always reading actively. Consider reading shorter works multiple times, circling things you had trouble understanding the first time., No matter what your assignment is, you will need to understand the big idea of the text. Any part of the book that seems to speak to a major idea, should be clearly marked. Consider drawing a big asterisk in the margins so that you can easily find these elements later.\n If you miss something important it can be very difficult to go back and find it. Yellow highlighter is the best way to mark text without making it hard to read. Pencil is easy to erase if you want to correct something or return the book to a pristine condition after you finish. </ref>\n\n\nPen generally isn\u2019t recommended because a lot of pen annotations can make the text messy, but if you are going to be taking notes sparingly and want permanent reminders, pen can work.\n If you don\u2019t want to dirty up your copy of the book with a lot of writing, place Post-it notes in the book and write comments on them. This will also make it easier to find your notes when you are done.\n Taking a yellow highlighter to important parts of the reading is the best way to mark relevant sections without making it harder to read. However, you can also circle and underline words. Consider using different annotations to identify different topics.\n\n\nMost e-book readers will allow you to highlight passages. Marvin will even allow you to use multiple colors when highlighting the text., Use circles, boxes, multiple colors, and so on. The more techniques you use to annotate the text, the easier it will be to find specific types of information. You can, for example, circle vocabulary you have trouble with so you can easily skim through and find vocabulary later. How you use each type of annotation will depend upon what you need to look for in the text.\n\n\nFor example, you may want to circle new vocabulary, box figurative language, underline thematic statements, and place parenthesis around descriptions of setting. Most e-readers don\u2019t allow so many different types of annotations, but some, like Clearview, offer at least a few types of annotation.You can use different color highlighters to identify text relevant to character, theme, or setting. You can also use different color highlighters to identify important statements about different characters.\nYou can create different symbols to make it easier to identify relevant pages. For example, an asterisk in the margins or top of the page could identify pages with major parts of the argument. You can use arrows to point to quotes that you know you will use during the essay.\n Make a list that explains what each type of annotation you use means. If you are using a print out, write the key on a blank piece of paper attached to the printout. For an e-reader, write a note at the beginning of the text. The front page of a book can also be a great place to write out your index., Try to develop a method that you can use for future assignments. After several assignments, you may no longer need to use a legend to keep your annotations straight.\n Overly underlined or marked text can be hard to decode. Be sure to identify what you are looking for in advance and limit annotations to text that is relevant to your assignment. If you annotate everything, your annotations won\u2019t help you find what you need when you review the book.Try to have a preliminary thesis as you read so that you know what quotes will be useful for your argument. Your thesis can, and probably should, change as you read. But having something at the beginning will help you identify important material.\n When you find a passage that may apply to your assignment, create brackets around the text. Then, record significant observations or ideas in the margins. If you do not want to mark up the text so much, you can write your observations on Post-it Notes or a separate piece of paper with page numbers listed.A common mistake with annotations is to underline too much and take too few notes. Your notes will help you to make important connections that you can refer to later. Otherwise, you might forget what it was that you found to be important about the underlined section.\nE-readers also allow you to place notes in the text of the book and sometimes to export them to your computer. Most allow you to instantly search through your notes for keywords. \u201cSkim\u201d allows you to include different types of notes in the text and automatically creates bibliographies with your notes., Write down predictions so that you can return to the text later and remember where you think the text was going. This can be a good way to think about how the story or argument evolves and to pick out any curve balls the author might have thrown.\n Write down page numbers and a short description for the most important parts of the book. Try to group these comments by relevant subject, like theme, character change and repetitive figurative language on your additional note pages. For a book, consider putting the index on the front page. Otherwise, write them on a separate page, or in a word file.\n\n\nKeep a list of themes and important figurative elements. This is especially important if you are going to be asked to do a literary analysis or write an essay. You can write these on a separate piece of paper, or on blank page in the front of the book.List comments and page numbers under each theme. The more detailed you are, the easier it will be to write a paper and provide evidence.\n Summarize the important points of each chapter. This will make it easier to go back and find relevant material. In addition, it will force you to digest what you read. Consider writing your own title for the chapter. This will help you think about the theme and major events of each chapter.In a book, you can write this in the space between chapters. For e-books, write notes at the end of the text in the chapter. You can also write comments on a separate piece of paper or in a word file.\n When you hit parts of the book that you have trouble understanding or that you think require deeper analysis, write questions in the margins. Return to these after you finish the book to see if you can answer them. Questioning the text is a good way to produce original opinions about it., When you encounter a word that you\u2019re having trouble with, circle it. Look it up when you can and write the definition next to it., Create a list of words that you circled. Go back and study it before you re-read the chapter. This will make it easier to understand the passage the second time.\n When you are trying to understand a process or a plot line, write down numbers on the margins. Number each step in the process as you encounter it. Then, when you go back, you can quickly identify how something happened.If, for example, you are reading a book on chemistry, you could number each step necessary to produce a chemical reaction.\n\n"}

They may think they are hearing voices because the neighbor\u2019s voice is floating through the walls, or they may hear their neighbors talking and believe they are talking about them. Once you are aware of the specifics of your loved one\u2019s delusions, you can help make any modifications to their living environment that may trigger or exacerbate their delusions.For example, if your loved one believes people are living in the walls, you can remove mirrors from around the house so they cannot see their reflection.\nIf they hear voices, then playing music may help block their auditory delusions.\n People with paraphrenia may try drastic measures to get rid of the delusions. They may want to move to another home if the delusions are related to the neighbors. They may even avoid using their heater in the winter despite the cold. Help your loved one see that these drastic measures are unnecessary because they are only reacting to their delusions.You may need to stay with the person to help them through the psychotic episode, or your loved one may need to be admitted to the hospital.\nPeople can suffer from command hallucinations \u2014 auditory hallucinations in which a voice tells or commands them to do something or act a certain way \u2014 that can be harmful or cloud the person's judgement. Discuss how to handle these hallucinations with the person's healthcare provider.\n One way to help your loved one if they are suffering from hallucinations is to distract them. This may help to get their mind focused on something other than their delusions. These distractions can be activities with family, other seniors, or hobbies. Try to find things your loved one is interested in so they will be more likely to participate.\n\n\nYou may try helping your loved one find a hobby, such as knitting, reading, or crafts.\nYou may want to help create an activity schedule for your loved one so they have one activity planned each day. This helps keep them active, social, and distracted. Being alone and inactive too much can encourage delusions and worsen symptoms of depression or anxiety.\n Since your loved one has paraphrenia, they will have odd and elaborate delusions. This may happen when you are with your loved one, or your loved one may tell you about a delusion when you see them the next time. Respond empathetically in a clam, kind, and controlled manner.\n\n\nYou should neither agree with the delusion nor directly challenge it. Instead, try to validate their feelings. For instance, if the person is hearing voices, don't say \"Yes, I hear them, too,\" or \"There's nothing there. You're hallucinating.\" Instead, try something like, \"I don't hear those voices, but I can see that it's really upsetting you.\"Don\u2019t get angry or annoyed at your loved one \u2014 remember that delusions are due to illness, not stubbornness or stupidity., Since your loved one has paraphrenia, they will more than likely have a psychotic episode while you are with them. Most psychotic episodes occur because a person stops taking their medication. When you notice the signs of a psychotic episode, you should call your loved one\u2019s doctor immediately. The warning signs vary depending on the person\u2019s paraphrenia, but common warning signs may include:Isolating themselves\nIncreased insomnia\nAn increase in paranoia, delusions, or hallucinations\nDisinterest in personal hygiene\nAn increase in hostility toward you or others\nUnexplained disappearances\nConfusing or unintelligible speech\nLack of judgement or impulsive behavior\n\n, You should have a plan in place for psychotic episodes so you can help your loved one if one occurs. A psychotic episode is happening when your loved on has a sudden delusion or hallucination so severe that they detach from reality. The delusion may cause your loved one to be a threat to their personal or others\u2019 well-being.Contact your loved one\u2019s doctor or emergency services. Your loved one may need to be hospitalized. Make sure you know which hospital your loved one needs to go to.\nEliminate any triggers, such as television, music, or anything with loud noises.\nSpeak to your loved one in a calm voice to help diffuse the tension.\nRefrain from reasoning with them since they have broken with reality.\n Being diagnosed late in life with paraphrenia is not easy for your loved one. Your loved one may feel depressed or confused. They may also want to give up and think they would be better off dead. If your loved one feels this way, make sure they know that you love them and that you are there for them. Help them realize they are not alone.Even when in the middle of a delusion, you should treat your loved one with compassion, understanding, and love.\nHelp your loved one feel safe with you. Listen to what your loved one has to say and really hear what they\u2019re saying. This will help your loved one feel like they can come to you when they need help.\nRemember, since paraphrenia is diagnosed later in life, your loved one may not know how to need someone to help take care of them or how to adapt to living with a mental illness.\n Because paraphrenia occurs in older or elderly people, you may feel the urge to treat your loved one like a child or an invalid. You may want to do everything for them to make it easier on them or because you don\u2019t think they can do it themselves. This is not healthy for your loved one. Despite the paraphrenia, they can still live a normal, healthy life. Help your loved one do things for themselves while you are together.\n\n\nThis causes less stress for you because you do not have to be responsible for every detail of your loved one\u2019s life.\n\n"}

So if you want to get paid to be a soccer coach you need to have qualifications and apply for a job in a league or overseas in English premier league to get paid lots of money to look after your family.\n, Finance and insurance in soccer coaching is the most important thing both for the player and the club. It\u2019s important because in professional coach you have to pay the player with their skills standards and position so good players get more money in their wages and also you need to buy new players from other clubs. The money helps to keep the club in shape, and you need insurance on equipment such as team bus, other gear and maybe the soccer field too.\n There is lot of media involved in the soccer coaching and soccer in general for example; television, radio, the newspaper; the most important thing is the magazine. They bring out new FIFA magazine English premier league every month.\n There are a lot of injuries in this sport industry when players get injured will need physiologist, therapists and physiotherapists. These people get employed by the soccer club full time. Health services are needed because as a coach you need to know if your players are in good shape and if they can play the next game so health services are the most important thing you need to have as a coach.\n Transport is also involved in soccer without transport you can\u2019t go and play away games.

For example, if you lost a grandparent and your friend lost her mother, don\u2019t attempt to make her feel better by talking about how you coped after your own loss. Your situations are not the same, and you each probably have different coping mechanisms., One of the worst ways to try to console a friend is to tell them how to easily fix their problem. If your friend is inconsolable, chances are that they\u2019ve already considered possible options or scenarios before they got to this point. Even if you think you have a clear solution, they need to come to it on their own., It\u2019s imperative that you don\u2019t tell your friend that you think their reaction to their grief or loss is silly or irrational. Regardless of how you might deal with a similar situation, you must not tell your friend that their response is inappropriate.Simply telling your friend that whatever they're feeling is completely valid will go a long way in comforting them. Validating their feelings will help them emotionally and help them feel like someone understands what they're going through.\n Don\u2019t avoid your friend. Avoiding contact with a friend that is hurting does not help their situation and will likely hurt their feelings even more. Going through a loss can be an isolating, lonely experience. Be sure that you are there, even if you don\u2019t live near your friend.\n\n\nA phone call, Skype call, or text message can go a long way to let them know that you\u2019re thinking of them and care about their grief., People don\u2019t always want to talk about what\u2019s upsetting them. Sometimes, if you live close enough to your friend, simply being physically near someone can be comforting.\n\n\nIf appropriate, a hug or arm around a friend can speak volumes. Sitting quietly in their presence might be difficult, but just being physically present and sitting with them while they cry is a positive form of consolation.\n\n"}

This is because the oils in your skin can interact with the foundation and change the shade. You can counteract excess oil on your skin by using a mattifying primer on your face before you apply foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a clean makeup brush to apply the mattifying primer on clean, exfoliated skin. This will ensure your foundation goes on smooth and is less likely to change shades.\n It is also important that you let each product you use dry well on your face before layering or adding more product to it. Having excess moisture on your face can cause your skin to react with your foundation and lead to a change in the foundation shade.Once you apply a makeup primer or a face moisturizer, let the product dry. Use your fingers to lightly touch your face to make sure the product has dried before you apply any foundation.\nYou can also use blotting paper or a clean tissue to lightly dab away any excess moisture on your face, particularly on your T-zone area. This would be your forehead, your nose, and your chin.\n Always apply your foundation properly and evenly so it appears fresh and clean on your face. Dabbing the foundation on with clean fingertips or using a clean makeup brush to stipple on the foundation will ensure it dries properly. It can also help to reduce the likelihood of the foundation appearing cakey, thick, or orange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to apply one even layer of the foundation by dabbing or stippling it onto your skin. Blend the foundation in with clean fingers or a clean makeup sponge. Never sweep, rub, or smear on the foundation.\n You can try using a setting powder to help keep your foundation looking fresh and to avoid an orange tinge later on. Look for a setting powder that is the same brand as your foundation, as this will ensure the two products will react well with each other. Using a setting powder made by a different brand can lead to a negative reaction on your skin and oxidization, which can lead to an orange look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck that your foundation is dry before you apply setting powder.

Only purchase raw foie gras if you have a recipe that calls for it.\n\n\nThere are two basic types of foie gras: duck and goose. Duck is richer and more rustic, while goose is creamier and more delicate. Duck is also smaller than goose. Both duck and goose can be consumed cold or at room temperature, but when served warm, duck tends to be the preferred choice among most chefs.Foie gras usually comes packaged in four different forms: cru (raw), frais (fresh), mi-cuit ou en semi-conserve (partially cooked), and en conserve (shelf-stable).\n\nThe raw form should only be used when you need it for a recipe that requires cooking the dish.\nFresh, partially cooked, and shelf-stable types are all ready-to-eat, but partially cooked and shelf-stable fois gras are typically the most preferred types.\n\n;\n, Warmth causes the texture to become smoother and the taste to become fuller, but most people find foie gras too overwhelming when served hot. As a result, it is usually stored at room temperature or slightly chilled.\n\n\nFor best results, put the preserved foie gras in the refrigerator 24 hours before you intend to serve it. Take it out of the refrigerator 15 to 45 minutes before serving and let it sit on your counter until it reaches your desired temperature.Remove the packaging after you take it out of the refrigerator.\nServing the foie gras any colder than this can mask the taste and texture too severely.\n Since the flavor is so rich, each slice should only be about 2/5 inch (1 cm) thick.\n\n\nThe average serving is 1.7 to 2.5 oz (50 to 70 g) when served as a starter or 3.5 to 5.3 oz (100 to 150 g) when prepared as a main course.Wait until the foie gras drops in temperature before cutting it. Cold foie gras tends to break apart unevenly.\nTo make the cutting process as smooth and exact as possible, select a thin, sharp knife with no serrations. Run the knife under very hot water and dry it off with a clean towel before cutting each slice. Wipe the knife clean in between slices.\nOnly cut the foie gras immediately before you serve it to prevent the dish from oxidizing and dropping in flavor quality.\nNote that this information only applies if you are serving a torchon foie gras and not a terrine foie gras. Torchon comes in the shape of a log or loaf and must be sliced. Terrine comes pre-cooked in a terrine mold and should be served directly, still in its mold., Transfer each slice of foie gras to a pre-chilled serving plate. You can either eat the foie gras by itself or pair it with an accompaniment.\n\n\nTypically, you should serve the slice whole and enjoy it by breaking off pieces with a fork or spoon. The foie gras should be allowed to melt in your mouth. This is true regardless of whether or not you prepare any accompaniments.\nMost prefer to serve foie gras with an accompaniment since the flavor of the dish can be overwhelming on its own.\nTerrine does not need to be plated separately. It should be eaten from the mold with a warm spoon.\n If you're serving the foie gras as part of a larger meal, serve it before the main course. At this point, the palate is still fairly fresh and can appreciate the dense flavor of foie gras more completely.\n\n\nIf you are serving both goose and duck foie gras, start with the goose before serving the duck. The fuller flavor of the duck can overpower the taste of the goose if served first.\n Brown or white bread is the best option. Cut the bread into triangles before plating it, then place the foie gras on top of the bread or beside it.\n\n\nDo not spread the foie gras over the bread like a preserve. Your guests can do so if they please, but as a rule, it should be served as a whole slice.\nThere are two standard bread options: hot toast and thin country bread.\nHot toast is standard sandwich bread. Toast it lightly so that it is only a little brown, but still soft.\nCountry-style bread should be sliced thinly and toasted very lightly. Some prefer not to toast country bread at all.\n These flavors can cut through the sweet, rich taste of foie gras. The result is a balanced palette that hits a range of flavor notes.\n\n\nSweet-and-sour items are among the best options. Try a cranberry jelly or Asian-inspired chutney. Orange sauces and other citrus-based sauces can also work well.\nConsider serving it with dried fruit, like figs and prunes. Stone fruit, or fruit with a pit in it\u2014peaches, plums, nectarines, and sour cherries\u2014also work well.Sauces and jams made from these fruits can be spread beneath the foie gras or drizzled on top of it.\nOn the acidic side, consider serving the dish with a liquor-based sauce, like a caramel mixed with cognac or sherry.\n Many people enjoy the taste of foie gras when it is served alongside a glass of sweet dessert wine. Common options include Sauternes and Riesling.\n\n\nAdditional options include Jura\u00e7on, Monbazillac, Bergerac, and Gewurtztraimer (or other Alsatian wines). You may even wish to try it alongside a port wine.Ask your guests before serving them wine with the foie gras. Some people enjoy the combination, while others may think that the wine distracts from the taste of the dish.\n\n"}

Try finding things that you yourself no longer have any use for. Anything will do; it is amazing what people will buy. Look around. Would anything be worth more to you in the form of cold hard cash? If the answer is yes, put these things aside. Don't be too concerned with what the items are. If they fit in a box and are not complete trash, by the end of the day you may be able to recover a dollar or two.;\n, After you rummage through everything you own for anything you can part with, look further. A large supply of items is necessary for any junk selling endeavor. This part is largely up to the individual.\n\n\nOffer to help your friends and relatives clean out their garages for them in exchange for some boxes of their junk.\nVisit garage sales late in the day. Offer low prices for junk in quantity.\nCheck local dumpsters or shop on the curbside during extra trash day in your town.\n You should now have a pretty good sized collection. Depending on the amount of junk you have you can pick and choose what you want to take. Writing the contents of each box on the outside will make this step easier. Again, it's hard to determine what kind of junk people will be in the mood to buy so throw as many boxes as you can in your transportation and strap it all down. It is best to do this the day before as hopefully you will have quite a bit of stuff.\n Try to be at the market by 5:30 am, or an hour or two before the flea market opens. More than likely there will be a line of trucks that all have the same lots of stuff strapped to them.\n, As soon as you park and begin to unload your junk, a crowd will inevitably swarm around you of people trying to buy your stuff for really cheap before you've even set up shop. They will grab at your stuff like crazy people and yell out numbers while manhandling all your boxes. They may be trying to stun you into selling them really good stuff for cheap. It is up to you how you use this whirlwind. You may make a lot of sales during this initial frenzy, but be wary of getting flustered and saying yes to too low a price. Also, watch for people stealing things when your back is turned. It will help to have a partner so that one person can do business while the other unloads.\n Things will even out as people arrive throughout the day.\n Selling junk is great because you never really price anything until someone asks, you might have an idea, but it's all relative. Give discounts for buying more things. Fill a box with toys and sell handfuls or bag-fulls for a dollar each. Barter with people. The key to selling junk is quantity over quality and one dollar is better than no dollars.\n If you have a goodwill clearance center nearby, try there. There will be a crowd and you might have to fight for the good stuff but you can get a cartload of stuff for cheap. If you buy junk to sell, make sure that you know about what price you can get selling it. Keep your purchase price low.\n\n"}

The following covers some of the sacred books of the more prominent religions of the world:Christians believe in the Bible, which is made up of both the Old and New Testament.\nJews believe in the Torah, which also has the first five books of the Bible.\nHindus follow the Vedas, four ancient Indian texts over 3000 years old.\nThe Quran, which was written near 652, is the holy book of Muslims.\n Religions have nearly infinite variations, interpretations, and followers. Each religion, however, has its own level of acceptance for specific acts. If you hold a personal stance near and dear to your heart that can\u2019t be infringed upon, then look for the religion that most closely aligns with your internal beliefs. Think about a few of the hot-button topics related to religion.Sexual issues such as celibacy, abstinence, abortion, and birth control\nWar and peace towards fellow man\nTreatment of those who believe in other religions\n\n"}

Not only are you reinforcing what you're saying, your also giving them an excuse to start touching you back!;\n, If you already did some physical flirting, encourage him/her to touch you as well. Play a game like thumb wrestling, put an arm on his or her shoulder, and open up. Be creative. If he or she will smile, the person probably likes it and may want you to do it again. And when he/she touches you back in a sensual way, you are in!\n\n\nIf you're a guy, give the girl a piggyback ride. It's a good way to get close to her and show her how strong you are. Try not to move too fast or you could fall, which would not be encouraging.\nWhen the other person teases you, gently \"hit\" them on the shoulder. Mostly, girls do this when guys are playfully teasing them. Be careful doing this if you're a guy.\n Hang your arm around the person a little when telling a joke or laughing. When you're telling a joke or he's telling a joke, put your hand gently on his/her shoulder while laughing.\n\n\nFor girls, you can probably do this pretty much anytime for any reason. You're asking him a favor, you're talking about your weekend, etc. It seems hard at first, but the guy will definitely be happy.\nFor guys, you can only really pull this off when being in a jokey mood, or if you're especially close with the girl. Or, after you hug, you can leave one arm around her for a little bit longer than normal and see how she reacts.\n Rest your head on his or her shoulder and say \"I'm tired,\" if it's late at night or if you see him/her early in the morning such as on the bus.\n\n\nYou can do this when you're pretending you're bored or exasperated, too. You're sitting next to one another during an announcement that's taking way too long, and you sigh as you move back gently and rest on the person.\n Hug, touch him/her on the shoulder, or even kiss them on the cheek instead of just saying a simple goodbye.\n\n\n\nHug the person when you see them in the morning, or when you leave for the day; when you're congratulating them for an accomplishment; or when you don't think you'll see them for a while.\n\nKiss the person on the cheek if you're a girl and you want to send him a signal that he should be starting to kiss you. Kiss him on the cheek as you leave and he'll be thinking about it for days to come.\n\nKissing casually is harder for guys to do to girls because 1) most girls don't want their private space violated; and 2) most girls will expect a first kiss to be a little more than a peck on the cheek.\n Mirror his or her pose when you are facing one another. This bit of body language sends a subtle signal; subliminally, they will feel as if they have a stronger connection to you just based on how you are mirroring them.\n\n\nDon't do this all the time, however, or the other person might feel like you're aping them. Make sure when you do it, it's natural.\n Tickling is a great way to flirt with someone physically. Tickling is OK among friends, but not so much among acquaintances, so make sure you know the person enough before you start tickling. Be careful to respect peoples boundaries and also not sneak into peoples houses and tickle them while they are sleeping. A couple tips when you are tickling:\n\n\nIt's more socially common for guys to tickle girls. That doesn't mean you can't tickle a guy if you're a girl, it just means that guys are usually the ones doing the tickling. Keep that in mind.\nOnly tickle in safe areas. The last thing you want to do when flirting is make the other person feel uncomfortable. To ensure that you don't overstep his/her boundaries, try focusing on the arms, knees, and feet.\nPay attention to your crush's body language, and what they say. If they're laughing and jokingly tell you to stop, it's probably OK to go on a little longer before you stop. If they don't laugh, however, seem uncomfortable, and ask you to stop, stop right away.\n Touch the person when you compliment their ring, bracelet, new shirt or hair. Or say something like: \"You have small hands,\" and put your hands against each others. See how long it takes before they pull their hand back. If it takes a while, s/he most likely enjoyed it.\n If you are afraid of rejection, start slow with a subtle hand touch. Do it in a way he/she will notice, but that isn't too obvious at first. Then slowly move to holding hands if the person seems to like the contact.\n\n\nFor example, when walking next to each other, you could slightly touch his or her hand. If this person noticed it, s/he will look at you, and when s/he smiles you could try taking his/her hand. If they don't like it, you will know it's too soon to start holding hands.\nYou can find an excuse for holding hands a lot of different ways. If you're in a haunted house, or on a rollercoaster, or showing them something, simply take their hand confidently and don't wait for them to react. If they don't like it or aren't ready for it yet, you will know.\nInterlocking hands is harder the first couple times than just clasping or \"cupping\" their hand. To avoid any awkwardness, stick with cupping in the beginning, where you put your pinky, ring, middle and index fingers together and grab onto the other person's palm.\n Dancing is a great, social way to get close to that person you like and show them a bit of flirtatious fun. Whether it's at a school dance, your birthday party, or waiting at the bus stop (if you're silly and/or have a good sense of humor), dancing can help set the stage.\n\n\nGo for the slow-dance. When that song comes on, go straight to your crush and ask them to dance. If you're a guy, put your arms around her waist. If you're a girl, put your arms around his shoulders. Get close enough so that your mouth is close to the other person's ears.\n If you feel awkward, just gently touch their nose with the end of your finger while smiling. Then, slowly lean into the person as if you were going to hug him and start to kiss them with a little kiss.\n\n\nIf you can tell that the other person is a little unsure of him/herself, after you kiss them, give them a bit of encouragement. Tell them something like \"That was nice, you're a good kisser.\" If they feel more confident, you're doing your job.\nFirst kisses can be awkward. That's just life. One thing, however, is certain: it takes time and a little bit of practice to get the hang of things. Don't worry about the awkwardness and focus on the things you like about the other person.\n\n"}

Consider the following:\n\n\nYou want to consolidate because you are overwhelmed with paperwork. In this situation, you can consolidate some loans through the Department of Education. You won\u2019t lower your interest rate at all. Instead, the new consolidated loan will be a weighted average of the interest rates on all of your loans.You want a lower interest rate. You\u2019ll need to pursue consolidation with a private lender. A lower interest rate will decrease the amount you pay each month. It will also reduce the amount you pay back over the life of the loan (unless the term of the loan is longer).\nYou want a lower monthly payment. Generally, you should consolidate with private lenders. However, if you consolidate with the Department of Education, you can seek income-driven repayment plans or extend the repayment period, both of which will lower your monthly payment.\n Some of the more popular lenders include SoFi, CommonBond, and Citizens Bank.Typically, you\u2019ll need a credit score in the mid-600s, so pull your credit score.Check the interest rates offered by each lender. Fixed rates range between 2-9%. Variable rates might be initially lower, but they can zoom up in the future.\n There are many people who can help you decide which consolidation path is right for you. Talk to your current lender and discuss your options. Consider asking the following questions:\n\n\n\u201cAre all of my loans eligible for consolidation?\u201d Most federal loans can be consolidated with the Department of Education. However, private lenders set their own rules.\n\u201cIf I consolidate my loans with the Department of Education, do I lose anything?\u201d For example, you might lose any credit you have earned if your loans are currently on an income-driven repayment plan.\u201cCan I consolidate if my loans are currently in default?\u201d\n\n, Gather your student loan information. If you are applying for a private loan, you\u2019ll need information about your financial history: job history, current income, educational background, etc.To consolidate with the Department of Education, go to www.studentloans.gov and use your Federal Student Aid ID to log in. You\u2019ll pick which loans to consolidate and choose a servicer. You\u2019ll also pick a repayment plan, which can run from 10-30 years, but income-driven plans are available also.\nTo apply with a private lender, you should submit information about your financial background and your student loans. They will make a decision based on this information and your credit history., Your financial difficulties might be temporary. If so, consider different options that will give you some breathing room. There\u2019s no reason to consolidate if you don\u2019t need to.\n\n\nYou might seek deferment or forbearance, which will allow you to suspend payments on federal loans for a period of time. Contact your lender.\nYou might also qualify for income-driven repayment plans on federal loans. Although you can choose these plans after you consolidate, you can also choose them without consolidating. On these plans, you might only pay 1-2% of your disposable income. As your income increases, you can pay more.\n\n"}

When you're attracted to someone, your brain has lower levels of a hormone called serotonin, which is common in people with obsessive compulsive disorder. So it's no surprise that if you like a guy, you have trouble concentrating on anything else.When you've got a crush, your brain will also release oxytocin, which can make you extra forgetful. This makes it even harder to focus on homework, sports, friends--anything other than your crush!If you can't stop thinking about him, you may also find you can't stop talking about him. If your friends call you out on always finding a way to work his name into a conversation, it may be a sign you've got a crush.\n After spending time with a guy you like, you'll just want more--you suddenly can't wait to get to school every day, you change your path through the halls to pass his locker--anything just to get a little more time together. Being around him activates the reward center of your brain, and you may begin craving that experience over and over again.Though you might be craving time with him, don't let this feeling lead you to do things that might cross the line from cute to scary. Don't show up at his house uninvited or start playing hockey just because he's the goalie. Just know that if you are always excited to see him, it means you really like him.\n If you notice another girl flirting with him and your blood starts to boil--why is he talking to her? does he like her? did she just touch his arm?!--your feelings of jealousy may mean you like him. But if you only notice him when he's with someone else, then you may just be feeling competitive, and be more interested in winning than actually dating him.Take your jealousy as a sign that you like this guy and don't let it go any further. If you get in another girl's face for talking to him, it makes you seem possessive and insecure.\n When you're into a guy, everything he does starts to seem amazing. He's nice, funny, smart, handsome--there's nothing wrong with this guy! Experts call this the \"halo effect\"--because to you, he's pretty much an angel. If you think he's cute, you're probably going to think everything else about him is great, too.If you laugh at all his jokes or think everything he says is genius, or you think he's an amazing guitar player (even though he only started playing last week), it's a sign you really like him.\n\n"}

It is also important to choose a food that is appropriate for small breed dogs because food for larger breeds may be difficult for your Maltipoo to chew.\n\n\nYou can check the ingredients to be sure that the food is high-quality. If meat (not a meat by-product) is one of the first two ingredients, then that dog food is probably high-quality. If not, then look some more.\nConsult a pet nutrition expert if you plan to make your dog\u2019s food. Dogs have specific nutritional needs that are different from what humans require and it can be hard to meet these needs when making your dog\u2019s food yourself.Talk to your veterinarian for advice if you want to cook your dog\u2019s food yourself.\n Your Maltipoo\u2019s diet depends on his weight and activity level. You can find a suggested range on your dog\u2019s food package, but you will also need to take your dog\u2019s activity level into account when determining how much to feed your Maltipoo.\n\n\nFor example, your dog\u2019s food package might recommend \u00bd to one cup of food per day. If your Maltipoo is very active, then he will probably need the higher amount of one full cup of food each day. If your Maltipoo is not active, then he may only need \u00bd of a cup of food each day.\n Free-feeding is when you leave out a large amount of dry food and allow your dog to eat what he wants whenever he feels like it. This method of feeding is convenient, but it can also cause your dog to become overweight or obese. That is why it is better to give your Maltipoo measured portions at specific times each day.Most adult dogs do best if fed twice per day, so you can divide your dog\u2019s total daily intake into two portions and give one in the morning and the other in the evening.\nTo determine how much to feed your Maltipoo at each meal, you will need to divide his total daily food intake in half. For example, if your Maltipoo is supposed to have one cup of food every day, then you could give \u00bd cup in the morning and a \u00bd cup in the evening.\n Adult dogs do well with two meals per day, but your dog may need to be fed more than twice per day if he is still a puppy. If your puppy is:\n\n\neight to 12 weeks, then divide his food into four portions\nthree to six months, then divide his food into three portions\nsix months to one year old, then divide his food into two portions, Treats are a nice way to reward your dog for being good, but the calories can add up and lead to weight gain. To prevent your dog from taking in too many excess calories, try offering:\n\n\nblueberries\nwatermelon chunks\nbanana slices\ncooked sweet potato slices\nbroccoli\nbaby carrots\ncooked green beans, Maltipoos can also get sick from some foods, so it is important to monitor your Maltipoo\u2019s diet as well. Foods that you should never give your Maltipoo include:caffeine\nonions, garlic, and chives\navocados\nchocolate\ngrapes and raisins\nnuts\nalcohol\nyeast\nxylitol, Like all dogs, Maltipoos need to have access to a bowl of clean, fresh water at all times.Ceramic or stainless steel bowls are ideal because they do not hold onto as much bacteria as plastic and your Maltipoo cannot chew on them.\n\n\nMake sure that you change your Maltipoo\u2019s water every day and replenish it often.\n\n"}

Some universities will offer undergraduate degrees specifically in zoology or wildlife biology, but you could also major in biology, environmental science, or another closely related field.When looking at different university programs, be sure to consider several different aspects of each university you are considering. You want to find a university that offers the program that you are interested in, but it should also be a good fit in terms of location, resource availability, and overall \u201cpersonality\u201d of the school.\nDon\u2019t forget to look into financial aid as well. You can consider loans as a way to finance your education, but don\u2019t forget to look for grants and scholarships as well. Ask the university\u2019s financial aid office about what opportunities are available, and also ask the department head about scholarships specifically for students of your major.\nFor example, attending a large, well-known university may look good on a resume, and may have more to offer in terms of educational opportunities and resources, but it may also be more difficult to get to know professors and access to those resources may be limited. On the other hand, a small university may not have the same prestige or resources, but may offer you a chance to really make a name for yourself by forging relationships with professors and other academic staff.;\n, During your studies, you will likely need to take classes in biology, chemistry, math and physics in order to help you understand animal biology. You might also take courses in plant and animal science. Many programs will allow you to choose courses that suit your specific interest once you have completed a core curriculum.You may be able to choose between completing a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of science. If you don\u2019t plan to go further in your education, then you can choose whichever course of studies is more interesting to you. However, if you think you\u2019d like to pursue graduate studies or do research, a bachelor of science may be more valuable because these programs tend to focus more on math and science.\nIt is important to keep your grades up during your studies. You may find yourself getting involved in extracurricular activities both related and unrelated to zoology, which is great. However, if you fail to keep your grades up you may be put on academic probation, or you may be unable to graduate.\nIf you are struggling to understand a specific topic, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Your first step should be to visit the professor during their office hours to discuss the matter. They may be willing to help you directly, they might also refer you to a university tutoring center, or to a private tutor directly.\n Look for opportunities that are in line with what you\u2019d ultimately like to do with your career. For example, if you think that you are mostly interested in research, look for any opportunity you can to get involved with that. If your university has a graduate program in zoology or biology, ask to see if there are ways that an undergraduate student can help out.If, on the other hand, you are more interested in being a zookeeper, then you might visit the local zoo or wildlife ranch to see if there are any ways that you can get involved.\nGetting a job can be difficult in any industry if you have no experience. You may not see the value of spending your spare time helping someone else, but it will give you hands-on experience that can help you find a job later on.\nTry to stay involved with activities related to expanding your skills outside of formal education as much as you can throughout your education. By doing this, you will have an impressive CV by the time you graduate.\n Though you may be able to find a job with just a bachelor\u2019s degree, you will be much more competitive if you earn your master\u2019s degree as well. If you enjoyed your experience at your undergraduate university you can look to see if the university offers a master\u2019s degree program. On the other hand, attending a different university for your master\u2019s degree offers an opportunity to forge new relationships and learn from professors and mentors who might have a different perspective.\n\n\nA master\u2019s degree is likely to be sufficient for any applied research job.In many cases, you can fund your graduate studies through research assistantships. Be sure to look into the different opportunities your university offers.\n If you want to teach in a university or are primarily interested in conducting independent research, then earning a Ph.D. is likely the best option. Additionally, if you are interested in specializing in a specific area (e.g. aquatics, ecology, or marine biology), completing a Ph.D. will give you the chance to do so.Look for Ph.D. programs that focus on the area that you are interested in. For example, if you are specifically interested in marine biology, then look for universities who are home to professors specializing in that area of research. Your Ph.D. advisor should have interests that are in line with your own.\n If you are interested in a specific area of zoology (e.g. birds, marine life, urban wildlife, etc.), then do your best to make that apparent as early as possible. This can be helpful in getting you a job related to that specific area.For example, if you are interested specifically in urban foxes, then take every opportunity to demonstrate that interest. If you have to write a paper in your undergraduate about a topic of your choice, make sure it is about urban foxes. If you complete a master\u2019s degree, focus your thesis on a specific hypothesis related to urban foxes. If you complete a Ph.D., make urban foxes the topic of your dissertation. Doing so will show potential employers what is important to you, and show that you have experience on the topic.\n This is particularly useful if you are interested specifically in a research career. Even if you\u2019re looking for a more applied career, involving yourself in research is still a good idea when looking for ways to gain experience. Having experience in research will help you understand how research is conducted in this field and how you can interpret findings when you are reading the literature in the future.If you are still in university, make sure you are constantly asking for opportunities to get involved. Many professors are happy to pass along some of the work to a responsible student.\nIf you are unable to find opportunities within the university, don\u2019t give up. Look for opportunities at a zoo, wildlife refuge, conservation society, or even a government agency.\n There is no such thing as doing too much volunteer work, as long as it isn\u2019t affecting your studies or your well-being. Look for opportunities to get involved with anything that is wildlife-related. Shovel manure at the zoo if that\u2019s the only opportunity you can find, pick up trash at a local conservation site. It may seem insignificant, but volunteer experience is a major plus for many potential employers.If you are having a hard time finding advertisements for volunteer opportunities, don\u2019t be afraid to take the initiative. For example, a local wildlife refuge may not have a volunteer program set up for a number of reasons, but if you show up and respectably ask how you can help, they are unlikely to turn you away.\n Zoology is a very research-oriented field, and you will need to stay current on new findings and trends. This involves staying up to date with the scientific literature.\n\n\nIn order to find scholarly articles you\u2019ll have to do a bit of work. You can visit the university library to see if they have access to scientific journals related to zoology (e.g. Journal of Animal Ecology, Animal Behaviour, or Mammal Review).Additionally, joining associations related to this field will typically give you access to a few journals in exchange for your membership fee (e.g. Zoological Association of America).\n The field of zoology is growing, but it is growing more slowly than many other fields. The projected growth is 4% between 2012-2024, which means that, while there will be more jobs becoming available, the competition for these jobs will be high. If your dream is to become a zoologist, don\u2019t let these statistics discourage you, just know that you will need to work hard to set yourself apart.The median salary for a zoologist is about $60,000 per year in the US as of 2015. Be aware that this can vary significantly based on where you live and the type of work you do.\n A zoologist can do any number of things. They can do research on a huge variety of topics ranging from the genetics of a specific animal all the way up to understanding the impact of a species on the environment. They can teach and write about the field. They can work in government agencies, in zoos, or at conservation sites.Where you work depends on what you\u2019re interested in. If you\u2019re interested in looking for answers about animals, then a career in research might be great for you. If you\u2019re interested in working directly with animals, a career at a zoo or wildlife ranch might be more your style.\n This doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the case, but many of the most sought after jobs in the field of zoology require the zoologist to travel in order to observe a particular animal in its natural habitat. Additionally, you may need to spend significant amounts of time outside regardless of the weather. If you don\u2019t enjoy the outdoors, you probably won\u2019t enjoy being a zoologist.That said you could potentially become a zoologist and not have to travel at all; For example, by becoming a teacher or a laboratory researcher.\n Without a well-written resume, you will have a tough time finding a job no matter how skilled you are. If you haven\u2019t written a resume, you can write on one your own or you can hire a professional resume writing company. Either way, you\u2019ll want to be sure that your resume highlights exactly why you are a great candidate.\n\n\nIf you are still in school, check to see if your university has a career services department. These departments typically offer free help with resume writing, so there is no reason not to take advantage of it.\n When you\u2019re just starting out, finding a job can feel like an impossible task, especially if you don\u2019t have much experience, and you don\u2019t have any contacts in the field. This is why you should spend time networking. If you start talking to people, you\u2019ll likely find that most people found jobs because of someone they knew.If you aren\u2019t sure where to begin, try getting in touch with a professor you had a good relationship with at school or think of anyone you have met that works in the field. Send them an email re-introducing yourself, and remind them of when you met. Let them know that you are looking for networking opportunities. They may have good suggestions for events you could attend, or they may even put you in touch with someone they know.\nNetworking can feel scary at first, but it is one of the best ways to find a job. The first time you do it will be the most nerve-wracking, but it will get easier with time and practice.\n Although networking may be one of the best ways to get a job, this doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need to actually apply for different jobs. Search the internet with the job title you are seeking, and the location you are interested in. This will provide you with a list of websites where jobs are posted.\n\n\nIf you are looking for a job locally, be sure to look around town for job postings, and perhaps even in the newspaper. If there is a specific organization you\u2019d like to work for, contact them directly to see what\u2019s available.\nTake your time preparing job applications. These days, the majority of job applications are submitted online, but you should still check what you\u2019ve typed into the form diligently to avoid spelling errors. A sloppy job application will likely be disregarded without serious consideration.\n\n"}

For instance, if there is certain topic you\u2019re hoping to discuss, and you have anything relevant to that topic, hold it up or simply touch it., If it seems that something you\u2019ve said was not understood, say it again. If this does not convey your point again, rephrase what you\u2019re trying to say using different words.Often, the particular way you may be mouthing certain words may look like another word. Re-phrasing the same statement with different words will likely quickly clarify anything you\u2019ve said that may have been unclear.\n This is the best way to convey a feeling of direct communication, even if you\u2019re having a hard time understand each other. In fact, you may even feel as though a deaf person is staring at you. They probably are, and you should try to maintain almost complete eye contact as well.Imagine if someone who had full hearing covered their ears while you were speaking to them. To someone who relies on lip reading, avoiding eye contact sends a similar message.\n While it goes without saying that you should be polite when conversing with other people, there are specific things to be conscious of when communicating with a deaf person. If you hear something you need to respond to, explain what you are doing. For instance, if the telephone rings or someone knocks at the door, say what you\u2019re doing before you get up to answer it.\n\n\nNever act as though a deaf person is not present. Do not speak exclusively to another person while someone who cannot hear is present. Speak towards the deaf person so they can read your lips and expressions, even if what you\u2019re saying is more pertinent to a third party.\n Whenever photos, drawings, or other visuals may aid or strengthen your ability to communicate with one another, refer to them. Similarly, pantomime an action or behavior, or use body language and facial expression to emphasize certain points. The way your moving alone can strongly emphasize what you\u2019re saying., A deaf person may or not speak. If they do speak, their verbal communication may be hard for you to understand. If you do not understand something, however, never act as though you do. Instead, ask the person you\u2019re conversing with to repeat themselves.Remind yourself that strong communication requires the patience to fully understand what another person has to say.\nAsk specific questions. If a question can potentially be answered in a few words, ask it in a way that will allow for a short response, or even simply a nor or shake of the head.\n\n"}

Do this long enough to make sure that the water has flowed over the entire area, and washed away any loose dirt and/or debris., Use antibacterial soap and water to clean around the wound, but try not to get soap in the wound itself, as this can cause irritation.This will help to wash away bacteria and keep away infection.\n\n\nHydrogen peroxide and iodine were traditionally used to disinfect skin wounds, such as a skinned knee.However, hydrogen peroxide and iodine can actually damage living cells, so medical professionals now advise that you should not apply them to a wound., If anything is stuck in the wound, like dirt, sand, splinters, etc., use tweezers to carefully remove this material. First clean and sterilize the tweezers by rubbing them with a cotton ball or gauze soaked in isopropyl alcohol.Rinse with cool water once the debris is removed.\n\n\nIf dirt or other material is lodged so deep in the wound that you cannot get it out, contact a doctor., Once you have rinsed and washed the skinned knee, gently use a clean cloth or towel to dry the area.

Without understanding these thoroughly, your review won't be able to enlighten potential buyers, so be sure to be thoroughly comfortable with the basics.\n\n\nIf you don't already own the smartphone in question (for example, if you're reviewing a range of phones for your blog), visit one of the smartphone carrier's retail store and play around with the phone, or ask a friend who owns the device if you can use it for a day. Learn about the phone's features, design, pros, cons, and the price.;\n, Start with the facts. Be sure to provide the smartphone's name, and any nicknames that it might have acquired in the market as consumers use it. Some consumers will only refer to nicknames when searching, so cover all bases. Give a basic rundown of its cost, availability, network coverage, plans, etc. as relate to your region (noting that it is also important to point out where you're reviewing from and the mobile carrier you're using, given that the internet is worldwide). It's also really helpful to introduce the review with the reason why you have chosen to review it.\n\n\nBe sure to include any relevant hyperlinks to help customers find the information you're referring to, perhaps even purchase locations.\n At this point, you can give your opinion about the phone's particular features. Outline or detail the features in different categories, such calling, text messaging, camera, MP3 abilities, navigation, web browsing, etc. This way, your review will be more thorough without being too confusing. It's a good idea to headline each category and to write succinct explanations for each part of the phone; a potential buyer won't linger too long for the advice.\n\n\nTalk about what you like about the smartphone you're reviewing, how easy it is to use, what features in particular are of worthy note.\n Readers of your review will be more pleased with an honest, fair opinion of a popular smartphone than a highly biased or positive review of a particular device. Plus, it's a lot more trustworthy if your review is balanced. In addition, it can be really helpful for future designs of the phone and for customers to know the ways in which you think the phone could be improved. This helps to give customers a heads up on weaknesses that they can choose to manage around or perhaps prefer a different phone instead.\n\n\nLook at the advertising blurb accompanying the smartphone. Consider whether you think the smartphone in question lives up to the hype or whether there are aspects that you don't agree with. It will be important to compare your experience with the advertised promises.\nEven summarizing the review with the best \"pro\" and the most annoying or disabling \"con\" can be a good overall summary for readers. For example, \"Pros: This smartphone has a battery that outlasts any of its competitors in the same niche. Cons: Its price and the limited color range.\"\n\n, Be sure to include photos detailing all of the features described. If you are recording a video review, try filming with a high-definition camcorder for optimum viewing because the clearer it is, the better.\n At this stage, it is helpful to conclude by giving your overall impression of the smartphone and your experience of using it, along with encouragement to try it. It helps to clarify if you think the smartphone will only be of use to some people (such as a business person or a teenager, etc.), or whether you think the phone is ideal for anyone; once again, that sort of conclusion is up to your opinion of its utility.\n\n\nPost your review on a blog, on a review site, or anywhere else relevant and be sure to respond to comments made to you. Sometimes developers will also respond if your review has struck a chord, so it pays to monitor your review actively for a good period of time.\n\n"}

It is easier to buy the plants, but also much more expensive. If you are a beginner, you may want to choose the plants, but if you have a green thumb, think about using seeds.\n Choose a place where the plants you have chosen will get an adequate amount of sunlight. Make sure there is enough room too. Some plants start out tiny, but in a matter of weeks have grown several inches, so keep that in mind when choosing where to plant.\n Most plants grow well if they are in rows, but they will need to be spaced out. Make sure you know which plants you are planting where. If you need to, make signs to place in front of each row. For example, there would be a sign saying \u201clettuce\u201d in front of the lettuce row.\n Plants need to be able to grow and develop their roots in order to stay healthy, but if the soil is too hard or rocky, they won\u2019t be able to. So you need to make sure that the soil your planting in is loose enough for the plant\u2019s roots to grow in. To loosen the soil, take a trowel and shovel up the dirt over and over, until it is light and loose. Some plants only need the soil to be a little loose, while others need it to be as light and sandy as possible.\n Make sure you plant the seeds at the right depth. Some plants like to be closer to the surface while others grow better deeper underground.\n This can insulate the soil and help prevent frost. You can use wood chips, leaves or compost. It should be several inches thick.\n Water your plants every day, more or less if you find they prefer it that way. If the ground freezes, water at a time when it isn't frozen. The amount of water you give depends on the plants and the temperatures, but the minimum is at least every five weeks. Remove weeds if they grow and kill any harmful bugs.\n\n"}

If you want your song to tell a story, think about each part of that story and how it feels. Make sure the story isn't too complicated, because it will be hard to understand.;\n, If it is a sad song, it should normally be slow. Happy songs don't have to be fast, but they are normally higher and always in the major key. If it is a dark song, it will sound great in the minor key. You can even add some chords that clash if they sound appropriate to the mood of the song and you know what you are doing. If you don't have very much musical experience, experiment and see what sound you think reflects how your song should make listeners feel.\n Keep trying until you find one that is best for your song. Then see if you can find chords that go well with your melody. It won't sound as impressive if it doesn't have some chords. If putting the two together is too hard, you could just sing the melody and only play the chords. A lot of songs are like this and they sound lovely. If you don't have a piano, you can do this with another instrument or skip this step. Just plan out a melody or chorus for your song.\n Make sure it is the kind of melody that will sound good with words, because some melodies sound good on an instrument but not with lyrics.\n Sing each line as your write it down making sure it has the right amount of syllables. You don't always have to rhyme but some here and there sound good, as long as your rhymes make sense and don't sound like you only put them there because you couldn't think of anything better that rhymed. Repeating a stanza a few times can be nice and it helps people recognize your song faster and be able to sing it.\n Touch up anything that sounds unsatisfactory. Now you have yourself a good song that came from the heart.\n\n"}

Then, remove the nuts and bolts from the hose with your adjustable wrench, and lift up the tank.\n\n\nLift up the tank carefully, and it will come off the bottom portion of the toilet.\nTurn the tank upside down, resting it on the toilet seat.\n Locate the thick, conical rubber gasket and remove it.

This clip connects the flush valve to the filler valve.\n Use 409 or a similar cleaning product and Clorox with bleach to clean the surfaces that touch the flush valve.\n\n\nThis will prevent any debris or residue from interfering with the flush valve's seal, ensuring that you do not get leaks.\nUse a rag and cleaning product.\n The new valve will go in the same way the old valve came out. Push the new valve through the bottom of the tank. Take the valve with the threaded side up and slowly direct it through the hole so your hand is in the tank. Be careful not to attach it too tightly, or it might cause the tank to crack.Make sure the black tube, extending from the top of the new valve, is one inch below the toilet lever or handle on the left side of the toilet tank.\nCut the tube to the correct height, before putting the hose back on. The manufacturer's instructions will specify what that height is. For example, with a Fluidmaster 507A/B/D flush valve, you'll want to cut the overflow pipe so it's at least one inch below the hole in the tank where the flush lever is mounted., Once the flush valve is in the hole, attach a new thick rubber gasket (the same type as you removed). Then, hold the valve steady and replace the attaching nut, screwing it tight with your hands.\n Replace the hose, attaching it to the black plastic tube extending from the top of the flush valve.\n Turn the toilet tank right side up, and put it back on the toilet carefully, in order to avoid damaging any of your recently installed parts.\n\n\nPut the old nuts back on to make the tank sits snug on the toilet.\nIf you have purchased a toilet kit, use the new screws it includes.\n, The supply hose located on the bottom of the toilet tank should be reattached to the toilet at this point, to restore water flow. It has a plastic nut on the end with threads.\n\n\nConnect it to the filler valve (looks like a little white tube) by threading the nut and bolt by hand.\nThen, use a wrench to tighten the nut a quarter of a turn. Do not overtighten.\n Flush the toilet a few times to check for potential leaks that may have developed. If the toilet has a leak, it will leak immediately.\n\n\nGet under the toilet with a flashlight and see if the toilet is dripping.\nIdentify where the leak is coming from. Generally, water could be coming from the supply line or from a leaky gasket.\nShut off the water to check over the conical gasket and the supply line attachment.\nInspect and tighten the connections to address leaks.\n The water level should usually line up with the water mark on the inside of the toilet bowl. If water does not rise to the right level in the toilet, adjust the filler valve.\n\n\nYou can adjust the filler valve dramatically by moving the entire valve up or down. For minor adjustments, use the filler valve's screw.\n If you hear a whistle or noise that sounds like air leaving a balloon, then the flapper valve is not closing. Make an adjustment to slightly raise or lower the valve. The screw for the flapper valve is usually found on the float that looks like a little barrel that moves up and down with the water level.\n\n\nUse a screwdriver to adjust the flapper valve's screw, tightening or loosening until the noise ceases.\n\n"}

In addition, it also contributes to building healthy bones. Make sure you are getting enough magnesium in your daily diet to help absorb the calcium supplements you're taking.To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds.Adult women under 30 need 310 milligrams a day, while women over 30 need 320 milligrams. Men need 400 milligrams before 30 and 420 milligrams after 30. An ounce of almonds has 80 milligrams of magnesium.;\n, If your supplement needs are greater than 500 milligrams per day after accounting for the calcium consumed in your diet, split up your supplement. Your body is only able to process up to 500 milligram at a time.Taking more calcium than you need can be dangerous. It increases your chance of having kidney stones and may also contribute to problems with your heart., Vitamin D also contributes to absorbing calcium into your system. Because of this relationship, most milk has added vitamin D to help you take in the calcium.Many dairy products, such as butter, cheese, and milk have vitamin D. Fortified cereals and fish are also good sources of this vitamin.For adults under 70 years of age, 600 international units of vitamin D per day is sufficient. Adults over 70 should consume 800 international units. To get your recommended intake, 3 ounces of swordfish has 566 international units, while a cup of milk has 115 to 124 international units per serving., This type of calcium, which is readily available, is best taken with food. It needs stomach acid to be absorbed properly, and the food activates your stomach acid.Other types of calcium, such as calcium citrate, does not need to be taken with food. This type of calcium is usually more expensive than calcium carbonate. This type is especially good for people who have stomach issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome., The same is true of your multivitamin if your multivitamin contains iron.Your body processes iron and calcium in much the same way, so taking them at the same time interferes with the body's ability to absorb both.\nThe same rule applies to food and beverages consumed with both supplements. Calcium supplements should not be taken with foods high in iron, such as liver or spinach. Iron supplements should not be taken with calcium-rich products like a glass of milk.\n These acids can bind with calcium and keep it from being absorbed.Many foods high in magnesium are also high in these acids. Therefore, while it's important to eat these foods to get the magnesium you need, you should avoid taking your supplement along with these foods.\n\n\nFor instance, spinach, many nuts and seeds, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, beans, and collard greens are all high in phytic and oxalic acids. Whole grains and wheat are also high in these acids, but don't seem to affect calcium absorption as much as other foods in this category., Alcohol can decrease your body's absorption of calcium. Don't drink more than one a day on average., To calculate the amount of calcium in your diet, you need to keep track of your food using a food journal. Basically, you write down everything you eat in a day, including the serving size. Then you can calculate the amount of calcium in the foods you ate.For instance, a cup of yogurt has 415 milligrams of calcium. Therefore, if you ate a cup and a half over the course of a day, you consumed 622.5 milligrams of calcium just from yogurt., If you're not 50 yet, you need about 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily. If you're over 50, your need increases to 1,200 milligrams daily.Limit intake to under 2,500 milligrams. While it's acceptable to take more than your daily minimum, you shouldn't get more than 2,500 milligrams of calcium between your diet and your supplements., Your doctor can help you assess whether you need a supplement based on your diet. She can also recommend the right kind of calcium for you and can look at whether a calcium supplement will interact with any of your medications or cause adverse affects for you.\n Some people are more dependent on calcium. For instance, if you have osteoporosis or at high risk of developing it, you need to be more careful about getting the required amount of calcium every day, as it helps keep your bones healthy."}

You can also write a script yourself, if that's something you enjoy and are good at. When you're writing, or choosing a script there are a few things to look out for that can help you pick the best script possible.\n\n\nStructure is key to a good story. The three-act structure is a device commonly used for scriptwriters to come up with a good story. It works like this: set-up (Act 1), confrontation (Act 2), resolution (Act 3). Key turning points happen at the end of Act 1 and Act 2.A good script shows rather than tells. You want your audience to guess at what is happening based on body language of the actors, what they're wearing, what they do, and how they say the lines. Screenplays are, by nature, extremely visual.Each scene has to be headed by a slug line, which tells whether the scene is interior or exterior, whether it is night or day, and where it is. (For example: INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT.)\nWhen describing action all you are describing is the actual, factual of what will be seen on the screen. For example, instead of saying \"John enters the living room. He is angry because his girlfriend left him,\" you would say \"John enters the living room. He slams the door behind him and kicks the sofa.\";\n, Storyboarding is incredibly important so that you know how best to direct each scene, what camera angles you want, what you want it to look like. You don't have to stick to the storyboard as you're shooting, but it will give you a place to start.Things that you'll be covering are: what characters are in each frame, how much time has elapsed between current frame and the previous frame, where the camera is in the frame (what the shot looks like).\nYour storyboard doesn't have to be perfect. It simply needs to give you a sense of the script and how the script should be shot.\nDecide on the tone for your film. A gritty film about a private detective in the 1920s is going to have a very different feel than a light-hearted comedy about the perils of parenthood. A great way to make your movie fail is to switch the tone midway through, so that the light-hearted comedy suddenly becomes a tragedy without warning. This doesn't mean that a comedy cannot have elements of tragedy, or vice versa, but your film, especially if you're new to directing, should stick to one tone.\n You can't make a movie without some kind of financing, especially if you want it to be a movie that people other than your family watches. Filming equipment costs money, you'll need props, locations, actors, and tech people. Most of these things cost money.\n\n\nIf you're going to indie film route, you should still try to find a producer for your movie, someone who will figure out funding, get you filming locations.\n If you're low on funding you'll probably have to do the casting yourself, but otherwise it's a good idea to hire a casting director to do that job. Usually a casting director has access to more avenues in which to find appropriate actors for your movie.\n\nYou want people who have been in other films and understand how it works. Theater actors are not great for this, as acting in a theater and acting for a movie is incredibly different.\nThere are good up and coming actors who aren't too expensive. What you're looking for is charisma and talent. This usually means not just casting your friends in the roles (unless you're just directing a film for fun, in which case, have at it).\n Movies require locations (a bedroom, a living room, a street corner, a garden, etc) in which to film. Sometimes you can film in these locations for free and sometimes you have to pay. Likewise, you'll be needing props, costumes, make-up, and materials for filming (a mike, cameras, etc).\n\n\nIf you have a producer this is what they will be doing. Making sure that you have everything you need and the permission to film in certain locations. Otherwise, you'll have to do this yourself.\nIf you're on a really low budget, talk to friends and family. Maybe you know someone who's good at make-up to do the make-up for you, or maybe your aunt happens to have a bunch of period clothes up in her attic.\n If you don't have a clear vision and plan for how you're going to film, what it's going to look like, it's going to be a difficult filming process. You need to have the specifics laid out and you need to know all the things to do that make a filming process successful.\n\n\nCreate a shot list. This is basically a numbered list of all the shots in the film that describes the framing, the focal length, camera movement, and things you need to bear in mind (like possible filming concerns). You can also double this up with the storyboard, whatever works best for you.\nCreate a script breakdown. This is basically the process in which you identify every single item needed for shooting the movie, including location, props, any effects, etc. Again, it will be easier if you have a producer to help you out with this.\nTech scout with all your tech people. This means going over to the movie locations and go over every single shot with your tech people so that everyone knows exactly what to expect for each shot. You can discuss problems that may arise (things like specific lighting, sound issues, etc).\n If you can get a good 1st AD (assistant director) you'll want to. They're the person who yells at the actors if needed and who does things like, takes down all the notes during the tech scout, and who schedules all the shots.\n\n\nScheduling the shots basically means setting up the schedule for when the shots are going to be filmed. This is almost never in chronological order, but usually has more to do with lighting or camera set-ups.\n This seems like a very obvious step, but it's really important. When you get to the actual filming part you want the actors to be comfortable with their lines and their blocking.\n\n\nStart off by having a script run-through, where you and your actors sit around a table and run through each scene. They'll be getting more comfortable with the words and with you and with each other, which will make the filming part much easier.\nReally talented actors don't necessarily need much of a rehearsal before shooting and it can be better to not over-rehearse highly emotional scenes so that they will be fresh for the actual shoot, but that only works with seasoned and talented actors, so if you're working with amateur actors, practicing the script before shooting is a good idea.\n An actor can't give a stunning performance without knowing their script backwards and forwards. You do not want them to suddenly turn up on set the day of the shoot without having learned their lines. This is why rehearsals are so important.\n This means what is going on in the scene beyond simply the dialogue. It will also tell an actor what his or her character's true intentions are, in the scene and in the movie, which will determine how you direct them.Less is more in acting in a movie. What you want for your actors is a strong presence that shows even when they aren't doing anything. An actor that can draw viewers into the character without doing much.\nFor example: John, our angry protagonist from above, is going to be played differently depending on whether he hates his girlfriend for leaving him, or if he's still in love with her (or both).\n The clich\u00e9 of the angry, screaming director is just that, a clich\u00e9. As the director you're the one in charge (if you don't have a producer) which means that everyone's going to be looking to you for calm and clear direction.\n\n\nThis is why the storyboard and script breakdown are so important. You can refer back to them for each scene and for showing your vision to those who are working for you.\nRemember that a movie gets made based on the contributions of a lot of different people, even if the director and the actors get most of the credit. It's best not to behave like you're the most important thing on set, when you're dealing with your cast and crew.\n This is for the actors. If you've explained the subtext to your actors and your vision for the film, there shouldn't be too much of a problem of them doing what they need to do in their scenes, but it is important that you give specific instructions, even ones like \"try that line again faster.\"\n\n\nTake copious notes. On your shot list write down specific camera critical things you are going to want your actors to do. The clearer and more detailed you can be in your feedback and your requests, the easier it will be for the actors and the crew to follow through on your vision.\nGive negative or detailed feedback to actors in private. You can even do this when other people are around, just as long as only the actor who is receiving the feedback is hearing it. This way no one gets embarrassed or offended.\nMake sure to give positive feedback. Actors like to know that their work is being appreciated and that they are doing the right thing. Make sure you let them know that, even if it's something as simple as \"I really liked what you did in the last scene; let's try that when we're filming the shot.\"\nSometimes, if you have a really good actor, it's best to let them do their own thing without a whole lot of direction. While it may not always go in the direction you had planned, scenes and the movie itself have a possibility to go in a new and fresh direction.\n When you're directing you're going to need to know the different kinds of shots and camera angles and camera movements so that you know how to shoot each scene and what you're trying to get from each scene. Different angles and types of shots change the feel of a scene.Framing (or shot length): extreme long shot (usually an establishing shot, from as much as a quarter mile away), long shot (this is a \"life size\" shot that corresponds with the distance between audience and screen in a cinema; it focuses on the characters and the background images), medium shot (this is usually used for dialogue scenes or a close-up on a certain action and usually contains 2 to 3 characters from the waist up), close up (this shot concentrates on a face or object with the background as a blur, usually used to get into the mind of a character), extreme close up (usually focuses on one specific detail like a mouth or eyes, usually used for some sort of dramatic effect).\nCamera angle designates the relationship between the camera and whatever is being shot and gives emotional information to the audience about the object or character in the shot. Bird's eye view (shows a scene from directly overhead, putting the audience in a god-like position, as well as making normal things unrecognizable), high angle (this has the camera above the action using a crane and gives a sort of overview of what's going on), eye level (this is a more neutral angle with the camera acting as another human observing the scene), low angle (tends to make the audience feel a sense of powerlessness, or confusion and as it is looking up at an object it can inspire fear or disorientation), oblique/canted angle (used in lots of horror films, this shot inspires a sense of imbalance, transition, and instability).\nCamera movements make the action seem slower rather than the quick cuts, but it can also have a more \"realistic\" effect. Pans (scans a scene horizontally), tilts (scans a scene vertically), dolly shots (also known as tracking/trucking shots, where the camera follows the action on a moving vehicle of some sort), hand-held shots (the Steadicam camera makes it so the handheld shots are less jerky, while still instilling a sense of immediacy and realism), crane shots (this is more or less a dolly shot in the air), zoom lenses (this changes the magnification of the image, changing the position of the audience either slowly or quickly), aerial shot (a shot similar to the crane shot, but taken from a helicopter and usually used as an establishing shot at the beginning of the movie).\n This is basically when the crew comes in to set up everything. If you have an assistant director, it isn't really necessary that you be there, but it's a good idea to show anyway. You can start thinking about the shots for the day and considering how best to do them and whether you need to change anything.\n Before you start shooting the shot and while your tech team is setting up the equipment, run the actors through the shot and figure out what they're going to be doing in relation to the camera (where they'll be standing, what type of shots you'll be using, how they're going to say their lines).\n\n\nExperiment with the viewfinder to test how the different shots are going to look. At this point you might want to change and redefine some of your scenes and shots to get the best possible scene.\n For each shot you'll need to know the focal length, the camera placement, the actors' marks (where they need to stand, etc), which lenses to use and the movement of the camera. You'll set up the shot, using all these different considerations, with your cinematographer.Now depending on the type of director you are and the type of cinematographer you have (maybe you're the one making the deciding on the shots) you'll need to give more or less direction. Discuss with them the lighting and the camerawork until the shot is ready to be taken.\n The filming doesn't take that long and it's usually a short scene that's being shot. You run through the scene, using the camera movement, and placement, etc. that you'd already covered with your cinematographer. When you call cut you're ready to move on to looking over the take to see how it went.\n Reviewing the take on the video monitor right away lets you consider how to make the scene better, how close the scene comes to your original idea. Then you'll repeat the scene until it holds up to your scrutiny.\n\n\nThis is very different from reviewing takes in the editing room later on. There you have the time, clarity, and perspective to see every single thing you could have done to make that scene better.\n What you're trying to do at this point is to put together the film edits in a way that is seamless, smooth, and coherent. As a general rule you want to cut on action, so that there isn't much of non-action boring the audience. This means that you cut from one shot to another right as the action is performed (like John opening the door to the living room). You'll join the shots with the first part of John's motion in the wide shot and the second part in a tighter shot.\n\n\nCutting on cross-frame movement is typical a reveal shot. For example, medium shot on two men talking, one man moves and reveals close-up on villain's face.\nCut to an empty frame, where the subject comes in. For example, this is often used with someone stepping out of a car, where you only see the foot. The foot moves into the empty frame.\nRemember, as you're cutting that it takes about 2 film frames (equaling about 1/12th of a second) for your audience's eyes to switch from one side of the screen to the other.\n For your soundtrack you will want to make sure that it works well with the film. There's nothing worse than a score that doesn't fit with the tone and the appearance of a movie. When you're discussing the music composition with your composer, talk about things like style of music, instrumentation, music speed, music cues, etc. A music composer needs to know your vision for the film to make an appropriate score.\n\n\nListen to the demo tracks that a composer gives you, so you can keep track of how it's coming on there end and where there need to be changes made.\nNow, if you're doing the music yourself, you need to make sure that you're not stealing copyrighted music for your movie, because you can get into trouble for that. A lot of times you can find composers for cheap in your town or city. It's not going to be professional level (but then, your movie probably isn't either), but it can still make it sound good.\nThere is a difference between soundtrack and score. The soundtrack is previously recorded music that fits a scene or sequence through content, rhythm and mood. Score is music that specifically accompanies certain images or motifs in a film (like the \"shark theme\" in Jaws).\n This means making sure that the soundtrack suits the finished and edited film. It also means going in and adding sounds that need to be added, or enhancing sounds already in place. You can edit out sounds that shouldn't be there (like a plane going overhead) or edit in sounds that should.Diegetic sound means that a sound is made by something that the audience can see in the image or the shot. While this will usually be captured when you're doing filming, it is almost always enhanced later, as well as adding things like ambient sound (outdoors) and room tone (indoors) to cover up things like a plane going overhead, but to make the background noise not utter silence.\nNon-diegetic sound means that a sound is coming from outside the image, as in a voice-over or the musical score.\n Now that you've shot your film and edited it and added all the different sounds, you're ready to show it off. Sometimes this means gathering some friends and family and showing your hard work, but you can also usually find other avenues, especially if this is something that is important to you.\n\n\nA lot of cities and states have film festivals that you can enter. Depending on the quality of the film it might even win, but at least a wider audience than your family and friends will see it.\nIf you have a producer, this is usually something they'll have been working on and usually you won't have gotten the green light on your project if there weren't some sort of distribution scheduled after its completion.\n\n"}

Stand or sit up straight, and don\u2019t be afraid to approach people directly while looking them in the eye.Smiling often is another way to project confidence, and make people feel more comfortable around you.\n People respond well to those who are dressed well for their setting. Your clothes don\u2019t need to be the cutting edge of fashion, but should fit you well and be appropriate for your work or classroom.\n\n\nPurple, maybe matched with grey, is a good color to wear that suggests intelligence.Keep your body covered, and avoid revealing too much. Showing skin makes people focus on your body, rather than your mind.Adding items to carry around with you can make you feel more intelligent as well, especially if they have something to do with your job.Even carrying something like a notebook or clipboard can help give you the impression of a hard worker with something important to do.\nWear glasses. Wearing glasses is a common stereotype of intelligent people, so don\u2019t be afraid to take advantage of this. It can be less effective if you don\u2019t really need them and people know. They will likely recognize them more as a fashion statement, which diminishes the effect., People associate reading with intelligence, so having some reading material with you suggests that you have other things on your mind. Just make sure it is the kind of thing that other people will believe is smart reading, so children\u2019s books or comic books are probably not a good idea.Make sure your reading material fits the setting. Reading a novel can be good for general settings, but something like the Wall Street Journal is much better in a business area. Just make sure you aren\u2019t reading when you should be doing your actual job.\n You don\u2019t want to be having regular arguments with yourself, but talking very quietly will make it seem like you are thinking about something important. Verbalizing your thoughts is also a good way to help yourself work through complex ideas."}

Avoid wasting time looking for tools or documents by having them all accessible and organized from the beginning.;\n, Even though you may just want to do this in your head, actually writing it down has a huge impact.\n\n\nTry to be specific and reasonable. For example, don't write 'continue novel' or 'clean house.' Instead, write things such as 'write 500 words' or 'tidy the living room floor.' Small, achievable tasks are best. If you have a big goal in mind, try breaking it down into smaller steps on your list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't get too distracted by the list. If list-making is taking more time than just getting down to work, put it aside and start being productive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf tasks have a deadline, mark them on. This will help you in prioritizing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrioritize the tasks. A simple numbering system works well - you can decide to either prioritize the tasks that need to get done first, or get particularly hard/long tasks out of the way first. Alternative, you might even opt to start with a few shorter/easier tasks so that you can knock a few off the list quickly.\n\n\n\nShed light on the situation. If it is day, open the curtains. If it is night, turn on the brightest lights. This will have a psychological impact on you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList all the advantages of completing the goal you have. Come up with as many things as you can. For example, if your goal is to make friends with a colleague, don't just say 'I will have a new friend.' Instead, advantages can include: I can meet people from their social circles; Our work can be more enjoyable; We can learn from each other; They may encourage me on days when I feel demotivated etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell people when you will be finished by. This is a very powerful tool for getting things done as it increases the pressure on you. Tell as many people as you can and emphasize how good your finished thing shall be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet rewards for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the windows if you can to let in fresh air.\n Some people prefer to work in silence; others like to have music on. Also, find what type of music is best. While most find relaxing, gentle music best for homework, college assignments, etc; others don't. Most people find that the type of music varies from task to task (e.g. fast music for cleaning or relaxing music for paperwork).\n\n\nRemember that you may not be able to play music for the task. For example, you may not be allowed to play music at work/school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry not to play music that you will be tempted to sing along with.\n Distractions can include phones, emails, social media, family etc. Whatever is deterring you from working needs to be removed. If you are being distracted every 15 minutes, you will get little work done because it is impossible to get immediately back to work after a distraction. For most people this takes 5 - 10 minutes.\n\n\nConsider letting your family members, coworkers/classmates, or housemates know that you're buckling down to work on something important, so that they won't distract you.\n Many people believe that multitasking increases productivity, but the truth is tackling things one at a time will allow you to complete more in less time.\n\n\nBreak tasks into smaller chunks if needed. One huge job can seem overwhelming, but if you break it down into sections, it becomes more manageable. For example, \"write an essay\" seems big, but if you start with \"brainstorm ideas\" and \"write a topic sentence,\" each part becomes a much smaller and more achievable goal.\nAs you do each task, check it off your to-do list. This feels great, and can motivate you to keep going down the list.\n The breaks should be no longer then 8-10 minutes. During this time you should stretch and exercise a bit. This will help you come back to the task with more focus, and keep at it for a longer period of time overall.\n In particular, drink lots of water. Your brain and body can only work properly if you are hydrated. While drinks and snacks can be distracting, they also help keep your energy up. If you're thirst or hungry, don't ignore these feelings - take care of them, and get back to work.\n This may seem tedious, but a tidy space means a tidy mind.\n This shouldn't be a problem if you've already removed the main distractions before beginning work, but if you hear your phone ring, or get a Facebook alert, ask yourself: is it worth breaking my work flow? If there's something urgent you need to take care of, do, but if it's something you can take care of later, wait for your break.\n If you lose site of why you're working so hard, look back at your to-do list and try to refocus on your motivation. If needed, taking a few moments to re-adjust your mindset like this will help you stay on task.\n Give yourself the rewards you had promised yourself. Be honest with yourself - if you do not complete the task, do not reward yourself.\n\n"}

The stems of Swiss Chard are delicate so you should look for stems that are firm and unbruised. Though there are a variety of Swiss chard forms, any type of shard should look healthy, full, buoyant, and not wilted or droopy., There are several varieties of Swiss chard. Their ribs, which are the parts of the stems that extend up into the leaves, can be red, white, or yellow. The varieties have different tastes, so experiment to find which kind you prefer. Swiss chard with red ribs is often a little sweeter, with less bitter undertone than Swiss chard with white ribs. All the varieties of chard can be prepared the same way, but they can have a different flavor.\n\nThe ribs of different varieties of Swiss chard are different widths. Some people prefer the ribs of the Swiss chard and some like the leaves best. If you prefer the ribs, choose Swiss chard with wide ribs. If you like the leaves best, choose Swiss chard with thinner ribs.\n Before you cook the chard, you'll need to wash it. The first thing you should do is wash it well, by rinsing it in a sink full of cold water. You can even drain the water and repeat, unless the chard is free of dirt. If you got the chard at a farmers' market, it will be extra fresh and more likely to have dirt on it, so wash thoroughly. Don't wash the chard until right before you're going to cook it, or it will wilt., Small leaves of Swiss chard can be left whole or added to salad, and larger leaves with thin ribs can also be left whole for cooking. But if you're cooking Swiss chard with thick ribs, then you should separate the ribs from the leaves by tearing the leaves away from the ribs, because the ribs will need to cook for a few more minutes since they are tougher than the leaves."}

Those are fine for kids, but for an adult you should use a higher quality bag that looks classy. Most craft stores have an enormous selection of gift bags in a broad range of sizes, colors and materials.\n\n\nSelect a sturdy bag made of quality materials and make sure the handles are secure.\nChoose a simple bag that is all one color so that you can easily customize it with creative embellishments.\nHave a good idea of what you want to put in your bag before making a purchase or doing any decorating. Consider the weight and size of the items so that your bag will be able to accommodate the goodies.;\n, You could get really creative and choose a vessel that ties in thematically with the goodies themselves or a vessel is actually part of the gift itself.\n\n\nFor example, if you want to fill the bag with cooking-related items for a chef, use a nice steel mixing bowl to hold the items instead of a bag. Doing this keeps the design elements consistent and the chef can actually use the steel mixing bowl later.\nGo green.Consider choosing a bag that is made with recycled materials or one that can be repurposed later, like a canvas bag.\n An easy way to maintain the perceived sophistication of the adult goodie bag is to keep all of the design elements consistent.This can be as simple as choosing a color theme for the gift and keeping that color consistent with the packaging, decorations and items inside the bag.\n\n\nFor example, get a nice yellow bag and fill it with goodies that are yellow or packaged in yellow. Something as simple as that will make the gift appear visually cohesive and the overall effect will look sophisticated and high quality.\n Are you bringing it to a birthday party or giving it to the recipient one-on-one? Is it a gift for a co-worker that you are presenting at an office party? You can then tailor the bag to fit the event.\n\n\nIf you were attending a woman\u2019s birthday beach party, you could choose a yellow/blue color theme that reflects the colors of the ocean and the sand. Using a canvas beach bag as the vessel would tie the gift into the party.\nYou could fill the bag with yellow/blue items that can be used at the beach, like a nice pair of designer sunglasses, a big fluffy beach towel, quality sunscreen, water-resistant wireless mini speakers, lip balm with SPF and a cute pair of flop flops.\n You are already using quality materials for the bag itself, and customizing it with a few additional design elements will add a personal flair to compliment the overall presentation. Since you are going for a classy looking bag, keep these additional elements to a minimum.\n\n\nTry adding some curly ribbon that matches the color theme, tying them around the bag handles.\nGet some nice postcard-sized cardstock with an interesting pattern and glue it on the bag, along with a paper cut out of the first letter of the recipient\u2019s first name (you can find those at any craft store) to give the bag a posh, monogrammed look.\nAffix tasteful cut out paper shapes that contribute to the theme or color scheme. Stickers are also an option, but opt for upscale designer stickers, like those used for scrapbooking (you can find these in any craft store).\n In most cases you will want to get some filler for the bag, such as tissue paper, shredded crinkle paper or cellophane paper. All of those come in every color of the rainbow, so choose something that enhances the design elements you have in place.\n\n\nFiller, along with looking nice, will also protect the items inside the bag and keep them hidden until the recipient opens the gift.\n Tailor your budget to fit the relationship you have with the recipient. In other words, you\u2019ll probably want to spend more on a close friend than a co-worker. Regardless of who the person is to you, give yourself a budget. Adult goodies can get pricy very quickly, so it\u2019s good to have some limitations in place.\n\n\n\nTo keep yourself on track when selecting items to put in the bag, continually ask yourself, \u201cIs this something I would appreciate receiving myself?\u201d\n\n, For a friend, choose upscale items that are tailored to what you know about them. For people that you don\u2019t know well, choose items that are a little more neutral that anyone could enjoy.\n\n\nFor an artist friend you could put all art-related items in the bag, like paint brushes, a small paint set, a book about their favorite artist, a beautifully bound sketch book and/or two tickets to an art film showing in your city.\nFor a co-worker you could use a dark brown coffee-themed bag and cream colored tissue paper. Inside you could put a nice mug, a few bags of high-end coffee, a small bag of bakery-made biscotti and a gift card for Starbucks.\n Everyone appreciates receiving things that are useful and functional. Gift cards fall into this category and since these days you can get a gift card to almost anything, tailor your choice to the person. Restaurants, department stores, craft stores, wine shops, book stores \u2013 the possibilities are endless.\n\n\nOther ideas would be movie tickets, sports tickets or tickets for a night at the symphony.\nSmaller useful items are great too \u2013 travel sized hand sanitizers that are high end or decorated could be included, or a well-designed pen.\n Don\u2019t go overboard with your choices \u2013 pick 3 to 6 quality items that are well-made and nice to look at and leave it at that. When paired with the sophisticated, well-designed packaging you\u2019ve created, even the smallest of gift bags come off as swanky and thoughtful.\n No birthday goodie bag is complete without a card for the recipient. Whether custom-made or store bought, include a card that ties in with the rest of the gift in color and/or theme. Sign it and place it into the bag last, so that it is on the top when the recipient opens it.\n For bags, add 2 or 3 small pieces of double sided tape near the top and press both sides of the top together to secure the bag closed. If you are using something other than a bag, do whatever you can to secure everything in place.\n\n\nPutting cellophane wrap around baskets and other similar vessels is a common solution.\n Your bag is nearly complete, so go ahead and give it a little test to make sure the bag is stable, the items don\u2019t move around and that it remains closed. Pick it up by the handles and walk around the room. If it\u2019s sturdy but a little heavy, carry and present the bag with your hand on the bottom of the bag to support it.\n Now that you are looking at the bag in its finalized state, you may get a last-minute idea for an embellishment or addition. Resist the temptation to add a bunch of new elements to the bag \u2013 just tweak it a little.\n\n\nAdd a little more curly ribbon or glue a few more shapes or patterned paper onto the bag. Purchase and tie on a helium-filled balloon in a complimentary color, if you like.\nCraft stores sell trim that comes in sticker form to be used on paper and in scrapbooks, so try adding a little trim to one or all of the bag\u2019s sides.\nTuck a single fresh flower into the top of the bag so that the stem is secure in the bag and the flower itself peeks out of the top.\n\n"}

Individual returns are selected for audits based on the scores from these two programs. Someone with a high score with one program or the other is likely to be selected for an audit.The first program is the Discriminant Function System (DIF). This reads the returns and scores them based on an indication for the change in the tax due.\nThe second program, the Unreported Income DIF (UIDIF), scores the potential for unreported income.\nThe exact details of how the DIF and UIDIF work are not made public. If a return receives a high score from either the DIF or UIDIF, the return is flagged and an individual screener will review it and identify specific parts that may need to be reviewed., There are certain kinds of deductions that are likely to catch the attention of the IRS and lead to an audit. You may want to consider whether the amount of the deduction is great enough to make the claim and risk the audit. Certainly, if you are entitled to the deduction, you should feel free to claim it. However, if your deduction falls in any of the following categories, you should be sure to keep very detailed records and receipts. (Note that having the receipts will not stop the audit, but you will need to be able to produce them if the audit happens.)Bad debt expenses\nCasualty losses\nHome office deductions\nMedical expenses\nBusiness travel, meal and entertainment expenses\n\n, Thought there is no real proof for this, many experts suggest that filing close to the April 15 due date, or even requesting an extension for late filing, may reduce your chances of getting audited. The rationale is that the IRS selects returns for auditing before then. Therefore, filing later will get you past the audit window.Understand that if you do file for an extension, you are still responsible for paying your tax on time. If you think you owe a tax, you should estimate the amount and submit a payment with your extension request. Failure to do so can result in penalties.\n If you believe that your tax return may trigger an audit based on some of the information that it contains, you may want to include some explanatory information. You can, first, limit your chance of being audited by completing all the appropriate worksheets or schedules for whatever deduction you may be claiming. In addition, including a note about some change in circumstances can help avoid the audit.For example, if your charitable deductions were significantly higher this year than in prior years, you should first complete the schedules and worksheets for charitable deductions. You may also provide a typed explanation for the increase.\nYour return may still receive a high DIF score, which will target you for an audit. However, the written explanation may tell the human screener all they need to know to keep you from getting audited.\n\n"}

After you get a short distance away from your den, either wait for your mate to bring all the pups to you or go and get them yourself.

Just let your mate come to feed them.\n\nIf however, you want to hunt yourself, it is\u00a0dangerous to hunt elk, because this can take a long time.

If this happens, run to it as quick as you can and take it out\u00a0before it dies. Feed it and continue., If it gets in the water, pick it up and run to the next side and feed it. Don't go to grab your other pups. Wait for your mate to bring them to you, because if you go to grab another pup he or she might bring the pup back to you., Continue feeding and defending the pups, eating extra meat and carrying pups until you reach the end.

Make a hoard of non-perishable items (canned foods) before the fall of law and order.;\n, We are all reliant on the supermarkets for food these days, but as the population increases, demand will rise and farmers will struggle to meet it, causing costs to increase - supply and demand, just like anything else. For example, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe meant that even a loaf of bread rapidly grew too pricey for the average Joe to afford. Learn to grow your own food; even if it starts with growing vegetables in your back garden and having a greenhouse. You won't need to pay through the nose when you can just grow your own inexhaustible supply of food. Though you'll need to grow more than you'd think.\n Related to the above. Rabbits will be a nearly inexhaustible meat supply. They reproduce rapidly and in large numbers (hence the term \"going at it like rabbits.\" They are cheap to keep, also. Chickens are a good one as well, though more for their eggs than for their meat.\n When food in the supermarket becomes either scarce or too expensive, this will apply doubly to meat. If you can learn to hunt or trap game, you will have an advantage over everyone else who will be spending their life savings on chicken breasts at the store.\n If you can, move out to the country. The more rural you are, the fewer people there will be, which means less competition for food. It also makes it more likely for you to have the space to start growing your own food - if you live in an apartment in the city or a semi-detached house in the suburbs, you're not going to have the space available to grow enough to live on. Move somewhere rural with a lot of lands, and start farming.\n Although our ancestors survived without power we have a difficult time doing that. Using solar panels and windmills you can have your own power source for things such as refrigeration and cooking.\n\n\nElectricity is a luxury really. Though if you must have it, set up solar panels, wind turbines, or even have a generator connected to an exercise bike (giving you power while also staying in shape!)\n\n, People who did not take precautions will need food and shelter. Purchase small handguns and large long guns and hide them through your house.\n\n\nKnow how to use the weapons and how to assert yourself without actually having to fire them. It is one thing to own a weapon; it is quite another to know how to use it, how to read people accurately and how to avoid conflict as much as possible, etc.\n Have bags ready so you can quickly pack essential equipment.

A small table, such as a coffee table, a side table, or an accent table, would be much easier to work with than a larger table, such as a desk. Metal tables are not recommended because they are more likely to chip later on.;\n, If the table is raw wood and not the slightest bit shiny, you can skip this step. If the table is shiny, it has a topcoat, which can cause the decoupage to come off. If you think that your table has a topcoat, sand the table down with medium-grit sandpaper.You only need to sand the parts you will be painting and decoupaging.\n Dip a soft cloth in warm water, and squeeze out the excess. Wipe it across the surface(s) that you sanded. This will remove and dust or grit.This would be a good idea, even if you did not sand the table.\n Start by painting the sides and legs of the table. If you plan on covering the entire tabletop with paper, leave the tabletop bare. If you plan on just adding simple cut-outs to the tabletop, you can choose to paint it or leave it bare.\n\n\nLet the paint dry, apply another coat of paint, then let it dry completely.\nAcrylic paint and spray paint will work well for this.\n The possibilities are endless here. You can cover the entire table with a large sheet of colorful wrapping paper or fabric. You can also cut smaller shapes out of scrapbooking paper, and decoupage it over a bare, painted, or paper-covered tabletop. Choose something with a nice patter, especially if you are using wrapping paper; avoid designs that make it obvious that it's wrapping paper, such as \"Happy Birthday,\" balloons, or Christmas trees.\n\n\nIf you plan on covering the entire tabletop, cut the material down so that it is 1 inch (2.54-centimeters) bigger on all four sides.If you plan on pasting smaller shapes onto the table, cut smaller images out of scrapbooking paper. You can also use printed images, fabric, cards, magazines, etc.\n Apply it only to where you will be putting the paper. This could be the entire tabletop or just patches (if you are using smaller images).Be generous with the decoupage glue. You want it to be nice and thick.\n Flip the paper over so that the back is facing you. Coat the back of the paper with decoupage glue using a foam brush., Don't press it down just yet. Make sure that it is places exactly where you want it to be. If the placement is off, carefully nudge it back into place.\n Work your way from the middle of the table to the outer edges. You can smooth the paper down with a credit card, a ruler, or even a clean, foam roller.Some stores also sell special smoothing tools just for decoupage.\n\n\nIf you see air bubbles, pop them with a pin or needle, then smooth them down.If your paper has overhanging edges, do not press them onto the sides of the table. Leave them hanging loose.\n Let the paper dry for 30 minutes first. Next, apply a coat of decoupage glue using a foam brush. Apply the glue starting from the center of the paper and work your way outward towards the edges., You only need to do this if you covered the entire tabletop with paper. Run the block back and forth across the top edge of the table. This will saw off the excess paper. Discard any paper that falls off.Wipe off any dust.\n Use the same technique as before: apply the glue with a foam sponge, working your way from center-out. Let the glue dry completely before moving on., You do not have to do all of the ideas suggested in this part. Simply choose one or two that appeal the most to you, and run wild with them!\n\n, Choose shapes that work with your tabletop's color and/or design. Cut them out along the outline with a sharp pair of scissors. Apply decoupage to the back, then place them onto the table. Smooth them down from center-out with a credit card.\n\n\nYou can do this step too, even if you already added cut-out shapes onto your bare or painted table. Consider layering the shapes to create unique images.\n Lay down a stencil onto you table. Apply acrylic paint over the stencil with a round, foam brush (pouncer). Dab the brush up and down over the stencil. Do not drag the brush across the stencil, or you will risk getting paint under it. Pull the stencil away when you are done, before the paint dries.Use colors that contrast with your design to make them stand out, such as white, black, silver, or gold.\n This method will work similar to stenciling and is great for a rustic design. Pour out some acrylic paint onto a plate, lid, or other pallet. Dip the stamp into the paint, then press it lightly against the table. Lift it away to reveal your stamped design. Repeat this step as often as you'd like.\n\n\nUse a color that contrasts with your design. White, black, silver, or gold are great, neutral colors that will help the stamp stand out.\n If you have elegant handwriting, you could write passages from your favorite books, songs, or poems onto the table using a thin brush; cursive or calligraphy would work well here. If you are very artistic, you can even paint your own sketches onto to the table instead; birds and flowers make great motif.\n\n\nKeep the designs and colors simple. Black is a great choice.\n This works great with cut-out images. Use gold or silver ink (or a thin brush and acrylic paint) to highlight certain features on your cut-outs. For example, if you used roses, you can add highlights to the tips of some of the petals. Keep it simple however; less is more!\n\n\nGlittery paint may also work, depending on your design.\n You only need to do this if you layered on more paper, paint, or designs. Let everything dry first, then apply the decoupage glue with a foam brush. Work your way from center-out, then let it dry completely.\n Choose a waterproof, acrylic topcoat. Spray it onto the table. If you need to apply a second coat, wait until the first one dries. You can also use a polyurethane topcoat, but be aware that it may yellow over time.Topcoats come in many different finishes, such as glossy, satin, and matte.

This should show you how to turn the oven on and off and how to do things like move the racks up and down in the oven.Make sure you know how to set the temperature. Electronic ovens usually allow you to punch in the temperature electronically and will then give an indication when the oven is ready. A light on your oven may go on or off or it may make a noise to indicate it's heated.\n Start preheating your oven while you begin preparing foods and baked goods if you're using an electronic oven. Gas ovens tend to heat quickly, but electric ovens need more time to reach the proper temperature.You should use an oven thermometer to make sure your electric oven is at the right temperature.\n Unless a recipe specifies an item should be placed on the upper or lower oven rack, always use the middle rack with an electric oven. This is the spot where the heat will be least likely to fluctuate during the cooking process. This will make your food cook more evenly throughout., Electric ovens tend to be fairly dry. Oftentimes, this can delay bread and other similar foods from rising. If you're struggling to make something like a pizza crust or loaf of bread rise, try adding a little steam to your electronic oven. You can pour a cup of hot water into a pan and then set it at the bottom of the oven. You can also open the oven a crack and use a spray bottle to spritz some water into the oven., You can use a diverse range of bakeware in an electric oven.

Material elements of a contract could include the timing of completion, the amount of money to be paid, the item that is provided in sale, or the manner of performing a particular service. If any of these terms is not met, and it is so important that the contract would be meaningless otherwise, then the contract has been breached.For example, if you enter into a contract with a DJ to perform at your wedding reception, and the contract specifies that the reception is from 4:00 p.m. until 10 p.m., it would probably be a material breach if the DJ arrived at 5:00 and told you that he had to leave by 6:30. On the other hand, the court may not consider the contract to be breached if the DJ arrived at 4:15 p.m. due to a problem with traffic.\nIf you entered into a contract to buy a new car, and it arrived without back seat floor mats, a court would not likely consider that a material breach of the contract. The dealer may need to provide floor mats, if that was part of the agreement, but you would not be able to cancel the entire deal.;\n, Substantial performance is a defense that would prevent the finding of a material breach. If either party has performed most of what was anticipated under the contract, the court will like uphold the contract. There may be some remedy to compensate for whatever portion of the contract is left unfulfilled.For example, suppose Tom agrees to whitewash Aunt Polly\u2019s 200 foot long fence, from one end to the other, both sides, in exchange for payment of $50. Then Tom completes the job, except that he leaves about 10 feet of the inside of the fence unpainted. If Aunt Polly sues Tom for breach of contract, Tom would be able to argue that he substantially completed the job, and he would be able to collect at least some payment. He would likely have to give up whatever amount it would cost Aunt Polly to have someone else finish the job.\nIf a contractor agrees to perform a building job using a particular type of material, but then uses something different instead, the court will consider whether the contractor substantially performed the task required. If the two materials are of equal quality, there is probably no breach of contract.\n In order to collect on a breach of contract, you must be able to demonstrate that you have been harmed in some way. You must be able to show that, because of the other party\u2019s material breach of the contract, you will either lose money, lose some opportunity, or suffer some other identifiable harm. In many cases, a well-written contract will include provisions that define what the damages will be if the contract is not satisfied.For example, a contract to lease an apartment for a year will usually require that the tenant make monthly payments by a certain date each month. If the tenant is late, the contract may prescribe a late fee of a specific amount as damages to be paid. If a tenant on a year-long lease leaves before the year is over, the contract will probably require that the tenant pay at least a month\u2019s rent as damages for breaking the lease.\n Compensatory damages are, as the name suggestions, intended to compensate the injured party because of the other party\u2019s breach. The purpose of compensatory damages is to provide the innocent party with the same amount of money the the original contract would have provided.For example, suppose Hillary enters into a contract with Donald and agrees to pay him $10,000 for legal services. Donald provides the service, but Hillary only pays $8,000. Donald would be entitled to compensatory damages of $2,000.\n Liquidated damages often apply if the contract is for a service or product for which compensatory damages are difficult to calculate. In such cases, the parties generally will consider the possibility of a breach when drafting the contract and will provide the terms of liquidated damages in the contract.Suppose Acme Company is opening a new store and contracts with Coyote Contractors to renovate the store space. Acme has an interest in opening its new store by the first of the month and has advertised special sales based on that. The contract between Acme and Coyote will specify liquidated damages of, for example, $1,000 a day for every day that Coyote is late in completing the job.\n Punitive damages are additional payments that a court can require if one party\u2019s breach is severe or is deemed to have been intentional. The amount of punitive damages goes beyond just compensating someone for a loss. Punitive damages are rare in strictly contractual matters, but in special cases a clever attorney may be successful in arguing for them.For example, if it can be shown that one party entered into a contract and never intended to provide the service or product, a court may order payment of punitive damages as an incentive to prevent that person from repeating the breach in the future. If Professor Hill signed contracts to provide musical instruments to children, but never had any intention of doing so, he could be required to repay any money as compensatory damages and then also pay an additional penalty in the form of punitive damages. (In such a case, he may also be facing criminal charges for fraud as well.)\n\n, In some cases, you may be able to prove that the other party committed a breach of contract, but the breach may not be something that resulted in a monetary loss. The court could find that the other party did, in fact, breach the contract, and then order payment of a nominal amount, mainly to make a point., Some contracts, particularly those for the performance of a service by a specially skilled or talented individual, cannot be satisfied simply by paying money. These require specific performance. This is an order from the court that the breaching party must provide the service identified in the contract.For example, a famous singer signs a contract to perform at a club on New Year\u2019s Eve. The club owner sells out after advertising that the singer will be performing. The singer then decides to take the night off. The court can issue an order for specific performance and require the singer to perform. (Alternatively, the singer could be ordered to compensate the club owner for the cost of refunding all the tickets and could be ordered not to perform anywhere else on that night.)\nA purchase of material is generally something that can be resolved through compensatory damages. However, if you contract to buy special marble from a particular quarry in Italy because of its high quality, and the contractor provides a different material, you could get an order of specific performance to require the contractor to get the original product.\n If the parties to a contract reach a point of agreeing that the original contract does not adequately serve their needs, then by agreement or with court involvement, they could rescind or terminate the original contract. A court is likely to order that a contract be rescinded if one party alleges that the contract has been breached, but the other party can show the that contract was entered into through some form of fraud.For example, Kevin sues Stacy for breach of contract because she has not paid him what she agreed. In court, Stacy demonstrates that Kevin lied to her about the item she was buying, so that she should not have to pay. In this case, Stacy is in breach for not paying, but the court is not going to reward Kevin for his fraudulent behavior. The court will probably rescind the contract, so neither party owes any obligation to the other.\n If two parties enter into a contract, but each one had a different understanding about the terms of it, the court may reform or redefine the contract to match a common understanding., As soon as you believe that the other party has failed to perform as you expect on a contract, you should notify that person. What you consider to be a breach of contract could just be a simple misunderstanding. If you point out the situation, the other party may very easily be able to resolve the problem and save both of you additional time and cost for legal action.\n\n\nFor example, ABC Company ordered 3,000 reams of paper from Paper Supply Company, Inc., at a cost of $4.00 each. When the shipment arrived, it consisted only of 300 reams of paper. ABC\u2019s business manager contacts the supply manager at Paper Supply Company, points out the shortage, and Paper Supply Company admits that it misread the order. The remaining 2,700 reams of paper are shipped the next day.\n If a simple contact does not resolve the situation satisfactorily, then you should send a formal demand letter. In the letter, refer to the terms of the contract and identify the breach that you believe has occurred. If you have previously attempted to negotiate a resolution, you should refer to those efforts in the letter as well. Make a demand for compensation that you believe would be satisfactory.Some contracts require that you send a written demand before ever taking further legal action. If this is the case, and you do not send a written demand letter but go directly to court, your case could be dismissed.\nA simple demand letter could say something like, \u201cDear Sir/Madam, It has come to our attention that you are in breach of the contract dated July 1, 2010. You were required to provide us with 2,500 blocks of Italian marble, but we received only 2,000 blocks of domestic marble. Time is of the essence for our building project. We require that you provide the specific product identified in the contract, no later than 30 days from the date of this letter.\u201d\n\n, The other party may contact you in response to your demand letter and offer some other resolution. Realize that even though you may be entirely correct, working out a settlement directly between yourselves is often cheaper and faster than paying legal costs and going to court. Try to be open to various possible solutions or alternative methods of satisfying the contract.For example, in the case above about the Italian marble, there may be no substitute if you are building a top-quality luxury apartment building. However, you might be able to accept a slightly inferior product in exchange for a reduction in the contract price.\n If no amount of negotiating helps you reach a satisfactory resolution, then you may need to file a complaint and have a court decide the matter. You or your attorney will need to draft a complaint that identifies the terms of the contract and the breach. You also must identify how you have been harmed by the breach and ask for the remedy that you seek. In some courts, you must name a specific amount of money. In others, you may be able to seek damages \u201cIn an amount to be proven at court.\u201dIf you are taking the matter to court, then you will probably need to hire an attorney. If the amount of money is minimal, you may be able to handle the case on your own in small claims court.\n Many states have laws that set minimum requirements for a party to enter into a contract. If these minimum requirements are not met, then the contract will not be enforceable, whether or not a breach has occurred. In all states, both parties to the contract must be at least 18 years old.In addition, both parties to the contract must be mentally capable. Proving mental incapacity can be difficult but, if proven, will provide a basis for terminating the contract.For example, if a minor enters into a contract to join a video club and make regular payments, and then fails to do so, that contract can be voidable. If the video club tries to enforce the contract, the minor merely needs to prove his age, and the contract will not be enforced.\nSomeone who is mentally unable to understand the meaning of the contract or the legal impact of entering into it does not have the mental capacity to create a binding contract. The person\u2019s mental ability is an issue that a court will ultimately have to decide.\n An \u201coffer\u201d is the promise that one party to the contract makes when agreeing to do something, buy something, or provide a service. To create a binding contract, the offer must include all the material terms of the deal, so that a third party could review the deal and understand the intentions. An offer that is ambiguous may not be enforced by a court, if the ambiguity is such that it prevents someone from knowing what the intended deal was supposed to be. Therefore, even if one party alleges that the other has breached the contract, the court may not uphold it.For example, if John makes an offer to buy Steve\u2019s car, and John writes, \u201cI will buy your car for $5,000,\u201d the contract may not be enforceable if Steve has two cars and nothing more is written. John could be thinking about the brand new Porsche, while Steve is thinking about the fifteen-year old Volkswagen. If John refuses to pay $5,000, Steve may not be able to prove a breach.\nAn offer is not enforceable if the material terms are not all provided. If John writes, \u201cI offer to buy your new Porsche,\u201d but neglects to include the price, the contract cannot be enforced. If the seller in this example sues for breach, a court will not enforce the contract because the price is not clearly defined.\n \u201cConsideration\u201d is the legal term that means that both parties to the deal must be giving something of value in order for the contract to be enforceable. Without fair consideration, a court will not support a claim for a breach of contract. Acceptable consideration may be an monetary payment, but it could also include providing a service, taking some specific action, or even agreeing not to do something. The definition of the consideration should be clearly stated for the contract to be enforced.For example, suppose Steve wants to get a new car for himself, so he write a contract to give John his two-year old car. John is pleased and signs the contract. However, then Steve changes his mind. If John sues for breach of contract, he will probably not succeed because he has not given any consideration in exchange for the car. The \u201ccontract\u201d is really just a gift.\nAnother example of consideration, in some cases, is one party\u2019s reliance on the offer. In this case, if John could demonstrate that he relied on Steve\u2019s offer and gave up the opportunity to get a bargain on another car because of what Steve promised, then John might be able to enforce the deal.\n\n"}

If food is kept on the ground, it could cause diseases.\n If you live in a Selenium deficient area (low Selenium in the soil, hence, in the hay), it's a good idea to have your Vet give your goats a \"BoSe\" shot once yearly. This shot contains Selenium and Vitamin E, which is extremely important for muscle/bone and reproductive health.\n\n\nThis is very important for pregnant dams (given about a month prior to kidding), as it helps the kids in utero to have proper heart and other muscular development, as well as helping the dam avoid kidding complications.\n Goats must avoid ornamental plants, especially those in the Rhododendron family. These can cause severe GI problems including vomiting, diarrhea and even death if the goat has ingested enough and the condition hasn't been treated by a Vet. Be careful of \"friendly\" neighbors who are giving your goats a treat over the fence that may contain rhododendron type plants. This is more common than you might think!\n\n, A complete grooming consists of a long bath and thorough brushing.\n\n\nIf you have children around, they love brushing goats. Make sure you supervise this activity.\n Doing it once a month is a great procedure and does not take a lot of effort. If you don't want your goat's hooves to bend, crack, or get infected make sure you trim them once a month.\n\n"}

Insects give to the centipede should be smaller than your centipede.\nDo not feed your pet centipede wild insects. Wild insects could have been in contact with pesticides that could be lethal to your centipede. Purchase small insects at a local feed or pet store.\n Earthworms, slugs, and snails can work as live prey for your centipede.

Your centipede will use its venom to paralyze the spider before feeding on it.\n\n\nBe sure any arachnid you provide your centipede is not venomous. Venomous spiders may hurt or even kill centipedes., Very large centipedes can eat small animals, including mice, lizards, frogs, birds, snakes, or bats. Mice and frogs may be easiest to find and feed your centipede.\n\n\nUse lizards and rats for a very large centipede. They should be able to use their venom to safely neutralize these animals and eat them.\nYou can also feed a giant centipede raw or cooked chicken, though it usually prefers to hunt animals.\nYour centipede may not eat all prey. If it sits for 24 hours without being eaten, get rid of it to avoid rotting., Water provides centipedes with the right amount of humidity. It can be used by the centipede to stay hydrated. The water may come from a water dish or from everyday misting.Centipedes get most of their water from their food. However, a water dish is necessary to maintain the proper humidity level in their habitat.\nUse enough water to keep your centipede from drying out.

If you think that you may have kidney stones, then you should see a doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor can diagnose your kidney stones based on your symptoms, a blood or urine test, or by using imaging such as a CT scan.Getting a CT scan is the most accurate way to determine if you have kidney stones. Your doctor can also use the results of the kidney stones to determine where the stones are at and how big they are., If you are diagnosed with kidney stones, then your doctor will recommend the best course of treatment for your situation. This may include drinking plenty of water in order to help pass the kidney stones or administering special medications to help you pass the stones.\n\n\nIf you kidney stones are large, then your doctor may need to use something called \u201cextracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy\u201d or ESWL. This procedure breaks large stones into smaller ones so that you can pass them more easily.Your doctor can also use a scope to break up a stone that is trapped in your ureter and make it easier for your body to pass.Be aware that surgery may be required for severe cases of kidney stones that do not respond to other forms of treatment., If your pain is severe, then your doctor may prescribe a prescription pain-killer. But in less severe cases of kidney stones, an over-the-counter pain killer will help to numb the pain.You may take ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin depending on your medical needs and personal preferences.\nAsk your doctor for a recommendation if you are not sure what to take.\nRead and follow the product instructions for any medicine that you take.\n\n"}

Try swapping regular flour for coconut flour, almond flour, or almond meal.Just be aware that you will need to adjust the recipe, as you cannot swap coconut or almond flour 1:1 with wheat flour.\n\n\nCoconut flour and wheat flour are not equivalent and, if you are using a recipe that calls for wheat flour, you will need to make some adjustments. For example, if the recipe calls for 1 cup of regular flour then you will need to use 1/4 to 1/3 cup of coconut flour. You may also need to add more eggs \u2014 for every 1 cup of coconut flour, you will need to add six beaten eggs and 1 cup of liquid, like coconut milk.It is generally a better idea to follow recipes that specifically use coconut or almond flour instead of experimenting and trying to swap them in for wheat flour. Try making some paleo coconut flour brownies.\n Rice is not allowed on the paleo diet, so you will need to replace it if you want to make a paleo swap for rice. Grated cauliflower makes a nice substitute because it resembles rice.Grate a head of fresh, raw cauliflower using a box grater. Then, cook it as desired or enjoy it raw.\n\nSwapping vegetables for grains is a popular paleo strategy that you can try even if you are not following the paleo diet.\n Pasta is a great comfort food, but it is not allowed on the paleo diet. However, you can easily swap it for vegetable noodles made from zucchini, beets, carrots, or sweet potatoes.\n\n\nIf you have a spiralizer, then use it to turn your vegetable into noodles.\nIf you don\u2019t have a spiralizer, then you can also use a vegetable peeler to create the noodles. Just wash and peel the vegetable and then use the peeler to continue shaving long strips off of it. Collect these strips in a bowl and cook them as desired.\n Breakfast can be a challenge if you are used to eating cereal in the morning. To make a paleo swap for cereal, you can opt for some muesli or granola.\n\n\nCheck the ingredients and look for a granola or muesli that has little to no added sugar in it.\n\n"}

If your shoes have a care label, use whatever the manufacturer suggests. Suede is also very sensitive to water, so basic dirt and scuffs are best dealt with when the shoes are dry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, Use the suede cleaning brush to lightly brush away dust or dirt that has accumulated on your shoes. Don't go back and forth: brush repeatedly towards the same direction. Once you get off this layer of grime, your shoes will already look newer.\n When you scuff your shoes, the suede's grain can get pressed down in one direction. Lift the grain by brushing scuffed areas vigorously back and forth. Again this is best done with a suede brush.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor scuffs that are too matted down to respond to the brush, try scraping the area with a knife to lift the nap.\n Scuffs and marks that won't brush out can often be removed by rubbing with a pencil eraser or a piece of crepe rubber (the crinkled rubber that many shoe soles are made from). You can also by a special suede eraser designed for just this task. Apply a moderate amount of pressure and increase as tougher marks require.\n Once they are clean (or when you first get them), spray a coat of suede protector spray on your shoes.

You have a couple general options when it comes to digital memory books:\n\n\nWebsites that allow you to put together your memory book for display online. These sites act as aggregators where you can add and arrange digital content into virtual albums. Some of these websites focus only on pictures and their captions, while others allow you to also share stand-alone text, videos, audio, and URLs. You can either upload your own content or add content already on the web to your digital memory book.\nPrograms, templates, and websites for building a more traditional memory book which may be published later as physical hard copies. These will allow you to select a size and format for your memory book and arrange pictures and text onto each page just as you would a traditional memory book. They are often paired with an integrated print service that will allow you to order a printed, professionally-bound copy of your book.Even if you decide to keep your book digital, these services can be used to create shareable files.\n Scan or download all elements you plan on including in your digital scrapbook. Make sure to optimize your content for your platform of choice.\n\n\nIf you intend on printing out your book, remember to scan and save your images and pages at 300 DPI (dots per inch) at minimum. Save as a TIFF for perfect image quality.\nIf you intend to keep your book entirely digital or publish on the web, compressing images to lower their file size is likely appropriate. JPEGs are generally good for photos but often introduce artifacts. GIFs are more appropriate for text or simple art but are limited to 256 colors and don't work well with photos.\nPNG-formatted images can be of good enough quality for print while not being too big for the web.With modern high speed Internet and large hard drives able to handle larger files, this format is becoming more common.\nSome digital memory book programs have their own built-in image editors. However, you will likely need to touch up your pictures with an image editor before importing them. Adjust contrast and brightness and correct colors as necessary. Crop your pictures digitally just as you would with scissors.\n Although not entirely necessary, choosing and sticking to a font (or set of fonts) and color scheme for use throughout your book will give it a much more professional look. You can use text with multiple fonts, colors, and sizes in the same project as long as long as each is used for a different purpose. For example, you could use large all caps purple lettering for titles with smaller black text for your captions.\n\n\nPick colors that match your theme. For example, a memory book of your college years may use your school's colors.\n If you're using a template, allow it or your software to guide you through the process, adding text and pictures where necessary. If you are creating your memory book free-form, it will be up to you to decide how each page should look. Just remember that memory books should include both pictures and text. Use picture captions to tell a story.\n If you want professionally bound digital hard copies of your memory book, either use your software's printing service or find one online that's compatible. You can also choose to do an inexpensive version of this at home by printing out your pages and assembling them in a notebook or with binder clips. You may also choose to store your book onto disks or flash drives to share with others. If the file is small enough, you can even simply email the file out. If you're using an online scrapbooking tool, make sure your privacy settings allow it to be viewable and share the link to you page.\n\n"}

You can also use a clean toothbrush with soft bristles instead.;\n, Ask your healthcare professional about specially formulated disinfectant sprays that are water-based. These can be used to clean as well as protect your device from contamination for up to five days.Avoid alcohol-based products as alcohol tends to break down the material of the piece faster. , Picks are small tools that contain a wire loop on the end that assists in pulling earwax from the device.They are inserted into the receiver tube in order to remove debris that is unable to be removed by wiping alone. They can be purchased at your local drugstore, online, or from your healthcare professional.\n Soft and clean tissue or cloth can be used to wipe down the outer surface areas of our device. Make sure that disposable tissues do not contain lotions or aloe vera.Additionally, if you use reusable cleaning cloths, make sure you clean the cloths regularly to avoid redistributing wax and debris onto the device. Tissue or cloths can be purchased at your local drugstore or supermarket.\n MultiTools are versatile devices that combine many tools in one. Not only do they come with brushes and picks, but they also come with magnets to assist in the removal of batteries.They are usually available online or from healthcare professionals.\n Hearing aid dryers are used to remove excess water after cleaning, or to prevent moisture-related problems. Hearing aids should be stored in a dryer overnight to keep them safe and dry. Dryers range in price from $5 to $90 and can be purchased online or from a healthcare professional., The first step is to make a quick visual examination of your device for visible buildup. Most hearing aids have specific parts where earwax tends to accumulate such as filters and wax guards, sound bores and hearing aid tips, and tubing.Filters and wax guards offer built-in protection from ear wax. They are designed to be easily removed by the user and should be inspected daily for wax buildup.The sound bore or tip of the hearing aid is where the sound exits. This part can easily become clogged and should be inspected daily for wax buildup.\nThe tubing connects the hearing aid to the ear mold. Wax can often accumulate here and the blockage requires special tools to dislodge the wax build-up. , The hearing aid should be wiped each morning with a soft cloth or tissue. It is best to wipe down hearing aids in the morning (not at night) so that the wax has had a chance to dry and will thus be easier to remove. Avoid wiping debris into the microphone ports., The wax pick should be used to remove wax buildup from the receiver or speaker of the aid. The small wire loop should be inserted into the opening of the speaker until resistance is felt. Scoop out wax from the opening until all is removed., For BTE aids, disconnect the ear mold from the hearing aid by pinching the tubing with one hand and the pinching the ear hook with the other. Twist and pull the tubing from the ear hook, making sure that you are near the seam between the two., Once the ear molds are removed from your BTE device, they should be soaked for 10 minutes in warm, soapy water. After 10 minutes, dry with a clean, soft towel, and use a dryer to remove excess water from the tubing.Do not soak the hearing aids\u2014only the ear molds.\n Once the ear molds are completely dry, reassemble by twisting the tubing onto the ear molds so that the wing of the ear mold is oriented oppositely of the sound opening., Whether using a cloth or specific tools, be sure to rid your device of dust and debris daily. Clean hearing aids and parts in the morning to ensure that wax is dry and easier to remove.\n Remove your hearing aid batteries nightly and store in a dehumidifier or dryer in order to protect them from moisture. MultiTools usually provide a device to assist in the removal of batteries.If you don\u2019t have a dryer for storage, leave the batteries in the hearing aid and leave the compartment open over night to dry out any moisture.\nHeat tends to damage batteries so choose to store them at room temperature., Insert hearing aids only after you have applied makeup, hairspray and other products to avoid buildup of foreign matter. Keep hearing aids in a safe, dry location (such as a dehumidifier or dryer) when not in use., Visit your healthcare professional every 3-6 months to do hearing checks and to check the functionality of your device.

Instead of thinking primarily about what you need or want, look around you and think about the needs and wants of others. The first step to doing this may be simply to become more social; joining clubs or groups and cultivating relationships can keep you from feeling isolated, which can hinder empathy., If you feel as though you lack empathy, think about your childhood environment.Many times, a lack of empathy or the presence of prejudice begins at home.Becoming aware of the limitations or biases that you grew up with can lead you to break the cycle and become empathetic of others yourself. This will help you understand the humanity of others.\n\n\nFor example, you may have grown up hearing your mother and father making racial slurs. Acknowledge that your parents\u2019 views were prejudiced, then think about what you can do to minimize or eliminate any lingering feelings about people of a different race in your own mind. You may also want to resolve that your own children will not have similar memories of their parents.\n Donating your time and money for an organization that helps other people can give you a broader view of the human condition. Find an organization that places volunteers \u201cin the field,\u201d talking to people who need help.\n Volunteering or spending time around people with different cultures or circumstances can give you a window into the living situations of others. To develop more empathy, try living the way that someone else lives for a while.\n\n\nFor example, if you wish to develop empathy for people who are living in poverty, find out what an individual\u2019s weekly budget is. Then put away all of your comfort items (such as your cell phone, your tablet computer, your television, and your fancy crystal stemware). Try to live for 2 weeks the way someone in poverty would live.\nEven if you don\u2019t give up the roof over your head, sacrificing your luxuries and trying to feed yourself on an extremely limited budget can give you a good impression of the way other people have to live every day.\n If a particular type of person makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable, try talking to him. Finding the common humanity of people who we see as \u201cothers\u201d can help us feel empathy towards them.For example, if dirty homeless people make you feel uncomfortable, try talking to someone who is homeless. Ask him what his name is and whether he has any family. Ask him his favorite food and what his favorite weather is. Then ask him about how he became homeless, where he sleeps at night, and how he gets regular meals.\n\n"}

One player plays discs black side up and the other plays white side up. Place 4 discs in the center of the board; 2 with the black side up and 2 with the white side up so that the discs with matching colors touch diagonally.\n\n\nThe player with black disks typically goes first; in other versions, the players decide who plays first.\nThe modern version of Othello requires this setup for every game. In the older game of Reversi, players placed the first 4 discs however they chose.Online versions of Othello are just as popular as the physical version and follow the same rules.;\n, To \u201coutflank\u201d a disc means to surround a row of your opponent\u2019s discs with two of your own discs. A \u201crow\u201d consists of one or more discs that form a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally.\n\n\nFor instance, the first player places a black disc in a spot that outflanks a white disc either vertically or horizontally, as it is not possible to outflank the white discs diagonally (assuming black goes first).\n Once a disc is outflanked, it is flipped to the opposite color and becomes the other player\u2019s disc. Following the example in the previous step, the white disc that is outflanked is turned to black and belongs to the black player.\n The opponent now places the second disc in a spot that outflanks at least one of the first player\u2019s discs. Assuming the second player plays the white discs, they would place one of their discs so a row of at least one black disc is framed by two white discs on each side, flipping the outflanked black disks to white. Remember that the row can be horizontal, diagonal or vertical.\n For a move to be legal, a disc must always be placed in a position where it can outflank a row of the opponent\u2019s discs. If this isn't possible, you must forfeit your turn until you can perform a legal move. If neither player can perform a legal move, usually because all spaces are filled, play ends.\n\n\nDiscs may flank the opponent's discs in more than one direction, turning them all over simultaneously.\nIf a legal move is available, you may not forfeit your turn, even if it would be advantageous to do so., Another way of ending the game is to set a specific time limit for each player's total moves. This means a game could end before players run out of legal moves and can encourage faster play. A player's time runs while he plays his turn and is paused when he passes the turn to his opponent. World championship rules typically give each player 30 minutes, but you can set a time limit as low as 1 minute if you prefer faster games., Once there are no more legal moves, add up all disks of each color. The player with more discs of his color wins the game.\n While it might initially seem like flipping as many discs as possible is the key to victory, this actually makes you more vulnerable. Most positions on the board can be outflanked; the edges of the board and the corners are the most stable positions.\n This will give you a position that can\u2019t be outflanked and is an important advantage as it protects many of your other discs from being outflanked as you reach out from the corners.Getting control of a corner is often enough to turn the tables.\n\n\nAvoid playing discs in the spaces immediately next to the extreme corners, as this gives your opponent the chance to outflank you and gain the corner position.\n Rather than simply trying to flip the most discs in one move, think about where your opponent might place his disc right after yours. You might be able to flip a large number of discs, but your opponent might play a counter that flips more discs back to their color.\n As your skill improves, you\u2019ll be able to set traps for your opponent, much like in chess. Start thinking about your opponent\u2019s likely plays, then push them towards a move that benefits you. Of course, be careful when playing against skilled opponents, as they may do the same to you!\n\n\nFor example, pay close attention if your opponent\u2019s discs move closer to the corners. They may be trying to goad you into playing close to the corner so they can outflank you and take the corner.\n\n"}

You also should not use more than you need since you should not return scalded milk to the container of un-scalded milk it originally came from.\n A low heat setting may not provide enough heat to actually warm the pan up, but anything stronger than a medium heat setting will likely bring the temperature up too quickly, causing the milk to boil and burn before you have the chance to stop it. A medium-low heat works best, but a medium heat can also be used as long as you keep a steady watch of it.\n To prevent the milk from thickening or burning and sticking to the bottom of the pan, frequent stirring is vital. Do not allow the milk to rest for more than 30 to 60 seconds at a time as it heats up.\n Do not allow the milk to start boiling, however. Once the milk has started to boil, it has gotten too hot, and a certain protein inside the milk may be destroyed as a result. The destruction of this protein could lead to a loss of volume in baked goods. Additionally, once milk has gotten hot enough to boil, it is nearly impossible to stop it from sticking to the bottom of the pan and creating a burnt film.\n Lift the pan off the stovetop and transfer it to a heat-resistant surface. You can transfer the milk to a room temperature container to prevent it from continuing to cook, or you can simply keep stirring it until it stops steaming. Most recipes suggest that you allow the milk to cool to a certain temperature before you use it, so you should check the milk periodically with a thermometer until it reaches this temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Or, it might be your mind if it's full of racing, uncontrollable, negative or unhappy thoughts. Or perhaps it's your skin, your knees, your lymphatic system, your broken heart \u2013 just pick whichever part of your body is hurting most or causing you the most discomfort in your opinion.;\n, What do you notice when you do this? For most people, you'll find that your body as a whole, including the painful area, tenses up. Be aware that this is a common strategy that we use to try to deal with pain \u2013 yet you've just learned that it doesn't work so well!\n\n, This time, pretend that the pain is no longer present. Ignore the pain and tell yourself that you're not hurting. This strategy is like playing peekaboo \u2013 first you see it but then when you no longer pay attention to it, you expect it to go away even though it's still very much there. Consider how this makes you feel \u2013 does the pain go away? No? You've just discovered another common strategy for dealing with pain that doesn't work!\n\n, Now say the following phrase to yourself, either in your head or out loud: \"I am resting for now.\" Then just pause. Think about what you notice now. For many people, focusing on resting works far better than working at trying to fix something relentlessly or to try to hide from it. Indeed, Dan Howard says that the more you work at trying to stop the pain, the less successful you will be. Instead, intentional resting requires that you notice what is going on in your body and then choose to rest what hurts.\n\n\nThis exercise can be done anywhere \u2013 you don't have to stop what you're doing but can incorporate this desire to rest the hurting part of your body into whatever it is you're doing. It can be done when walking, exercising, sitting, lying down, or being around other people.\n This isn't by any means an exact science and it'll require some trial and error on your own behalf to find what works for you. For example, Dan Howard has found that some parts of his body respond better to saying \"I'm resting into my \" than saying \"I'm resting for \". The aim is to find a settling feeling, a feeling that you've landed into deep restfulness for that pained part of yourself and you're releasing yourself from unease, anxiety and discomfort. It's a healing process and a restorative process.\n\n\nIt may be as simple as saying to the hurting part of your body: \"Rest\". Give it the permission to rest.\n It may take a number of attempts before the pieces fall into place and you discover how intentional rest soothes you and allows you to truly rest to the point of restoring your energy and reducing any pain.\n Rest does matter and yet it is tied up in so many negative connotations such as being lazy, selfish or unaware that many of us are too guilt-ridden to treat rest as the restorative we deserve. Martha Beck points out that we need to watch animals to be reminded what real rest is like. She relates an incident where she was watching a pride of lions resting after an unsuccessful hunt. Instead of sitting around down and low about it (and analyzing what went wrong if they could do such a thing), they sat, purred and rested for hours, surrendering to the need to regain strength rather than wallow in defeat.Yes, life can be hard and sometimes life stacks up all the odds against us and causes us to feel that we never get a break. However, by choosing to rest intentionally, you can heal the scars and restore your energy to face the challenges with greater strength and sense of purpose.\n\n"}

Though there are multiple lines running through and around the path where the Acela runs, there is only one single line to and from the places that the Acela will run on.\n\nUnderstand some of the other intended stops. It does make a few other stops on the line, and especially from the point of New York and points south, if it stops at one point, it won't stop at the other (look at a timetable of Acela trains and watch these differences are affected). Although it has stops in Newark (never at Newark International Airport) and Metropark, NJ, if it stops at one station, it definitely won't stop at the other.\nIt also takes up a few stops in Southern Massachusetts (not nearby Cape Cod), and Rhode Island, and Connecticut. It does make a stop or two in the tip of Southern Westchester County (New Rochelle as being one of its biggest stops in New York).;\n, Although most often times the Acela will have a train coming through about once every hour, due to seasonal changes and other track maintenance/work and other unintended delays, its time schedule can be delayed at times.\n\n\nRealize that the train may be stopped for up to one hour in New York, NY (Penn Station), as this stop is it's largest and most regularly-boarded stop on the route. It will take them awhile to debunk passengers as well as collect new passengers who are boarding, then they wait until the rest of the nearby track is clear (near the Hudson River crossing into New Jersey) and then take off again; all a process of about the hours wait. However, don't dilly-dally around when they say your train is \"now boarding\" from the timetable board.\n Obtain some money to pay for the intended trip. It's best to pay for an Acela trip as soon as those days are available to be seen directly from Amtrak's website, as fares for those days are always cheaper, and will always cost more as the trip-date nears. For a trip from New York to Washington, most Acela trains will run you $200-$300 from your pocket (and even more if you request to be upgraded to First Class/Business).\n Be sure to print out your Amtrak \"receipt\" and scan it into the self-service TripTicket kiosk, or if the nearby stationmaster is able to assist you, most stations will be able to print you out your tickets from that specific itinerary. If purchased from the Amtrak mobile app or from the Amtrak website, you can also have your tickets forwarded right to your virtual wallet on your phone.\n, If you purchased a digital ticket that can be displayed on the phone, make sure the pass is open in the virtual wallet on your phone so that the scanning experience for the train engineer is seamless.\n\n"}

Also, be carefree with many events that occur in your life, such as people calling you names. None of that matters when it comes to making yourself confident and happy. Remember that you should never change for other people, whether it's to impress them or simply fit in. Not only will you become fake, but you will also feel miserable rather than happy. You'll easily get tired of being the opposite of yourself.\n\n\nDon't worry if acting kind and blissful feels awkward at first because it'll soon feel natural once you get used to it. By then, people should know you for your pleasant manner.\nBe cautious when it comes to being carefree. You should know when to be serious in certain situations; otherwise, you may unintentionally hurt others and perhaps even lose relationships that may be important to you.\n\nFor example: Be carefree when people laugh at your mistakes, but quickly lose that attitude when a friend's family member dies.\n For example, you could say \"Sprinkle-riffic\" instead of \"terrific\". You could also exclaim, \"Dippin' dots!\" rather than use the word \"Wow!\" Not only will it sound cute and humorous to people, but it'll also be fun to say. Be creative when it comes to changing words to go your way, but make sure you don't turn them into bad words.\n\n\nKeep in mind that some people may find you annoying when you change words like that, but never change for them. However, if you feel uncomfortable saying words as mentioned above, don't feel forced to follow this step. Do only what's comfortable for you, but don't forget to be adventurous rather than uptight and stiff. Have a little fun with yourself, but not to the point that you hurt yourself and/or others!\n\n, Although you may believe that they don't want you to have any fun, keep in mind that they're only thinking of the best for you. Obey them while you're still under their care, and remember that they won't always be around so make good, happy memories with them. Tell yourself that they are the King and Queen, while you are the ice cream princess!\n\n, Ice cream princesses should listen to Nightcore music while keeping in mind that it isn't evil or bad. Actually, it's known as \"Hardcore Happiness.\" Nightcore basically consists of songs from songs that people hear today. However, the music is faster while the beat and voices are more high. Despite the fact that some ice cream princesses may enjoy it, you don't have to listen to it if you don't like it. When listening to music, make sure you choose only songs with clean lyrics. Be sure that the songs have no bad intentions hidden behind the words because ice cream princesses should be pure and not listen to any bad songs.\n\n"}

If you are nervous about apologizing to your older sister in person, you may want to write her an apology letter and give it to her to read on her own time.You can start the letter with \u201cDear Sis\u201d, and then lay out your apology. First, you may acknowledge your sister\u2019s feelings and then take responsibility for your actions.\nYou may end the letter with a heartfelt \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I did\u201d and a note that you understand it may take your sister some time to accept your apology. You may also offer to talk in person when she is less angry and end the letter with \u201cI love you\u201d to let your sister know you still care for her.\n Another way you can show your sister you are apologetic for your behavior is to compose an apology poem. This may be a good option if you feel more comfortable expressing your emotions in a creative way and do not want have to use the more formal letter format.ref>http://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/apology-to-my-sister</ref>\n\n#*You may title the poem, \u201cAn Apology for My Big Sister.\u201d You may then use the free verse form to write a poem where you address your sister\u2019s feelings and own up to your bad behavior.\n\nYou may end the poem with a line that says, simply, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I did to you.\u201d You may then sign and date the poem and give it to your sister so she can read it in private.\n You can also help to soften your sister\u2019s anger at you by giving her a special gift as an apology. You should think of a unique gift that will show her you feel bad about how you treated her and that you want to make amends for your actions.For example, if you stole your older sister\u2019s diary, you may give her the gift of a new diary with a better lock and key system. Or, if you broke your sister\u2019s favorite item, you may try to find the same item and replace it as a gift.\nYou may also want to tie an apology gift to your heartfelt apology. Telling your sister how sorry you are and then presenting her with an apology gift could end up winning her over. She may be more likely to forgive you if you offer up a gift with your apology.\n\n"}
{"title": "How to Calculate Your Final Grade1", "summary": "write out your scores.\nwrite out the total possible points.\nadd up both columns.\ncalculate your average grade.\nmultiply the decimal number by 100.\ndetermine your letter grade or grade point equivalent (gpa).", "article": " Find your scores from each assignment, quiz, homework, etc. throughout the term. Sometimes this will be collected for you online, such as in a system like Blackboard. Sometimes, you'll have to go through your graded work. Write them all in one column on a piece of paper to refer back to.\n\n\nIf things like participation or discussion are included as percentages of your final grade, you may have to ask your teacher or professor what your grade on this part is.;\n, Refer to the syllabus for the grading system. Teachers employ various systems to determine final grades, but two common systems are points and percentages. Either way, write out the total possible points in the second column next to the score you received.In a points-based system, there is a maximum number of points you can earn in the class. Each assignment has a certain number of points assigned. For example, there may be 200 total points available in a course, split up into four assignments each worth a maximum of 50 points (4x50=200).\nIn a percentage-based system, each assignment will be worth a certain percentage of your grade. These percentages add up to 100%. For example, you might have four assignments due, each worth 25% of the grade (4x25=100).\nNote that in these examples, each assignment is worth the same weight overall in your course, even though the numbers are different.\n Do this whether your assignments are graded on a percentage scale or some other total. Add up all the numbers for the first column and write the total at the bottom. Add up the numbers in the second column and write the total below.\n\n\nFor example, say you have 5 graded course activities total. 2 of these activities were exams worth 20 points each. 2 of these activities were quizzes worth 10 points each. The final activity was an assignment worth 5 points.\n20+20+10+10+5= 65. This is total number of points available in the class.\nNow add up your scores. Let us say you scored an 18/20 on your first exam, a 15/20 on your second exam, a 7/10 on your first quiz, a 9/10 on your second quiz, and 3/5 on the single assignment.\n18+15+7+9+3= 52. This is the total number of points you earned in the class.\n Now divide your total points earned by the total number of points available to get a percentage grade. In other words, divide the number you wrote below the first column by the number you wrote below the second column.\n To get a grade that may look more recognizable to you, you need to convert the decimal to a percentage. Multiply the decimal times 100. Another way to do this is to shift the decimal point 2 spots to the right.\n\n\n52/65= 0.8 or 80%\nTo move the decimal point 2 places to the right, add some more zeroes, like this: 0.800. Now shift the decimal 2 spots. This gives you: 080.0. take away the leftover zeros, and you get 80. That means you scored an 80 in the class.\n You'll need to understand your class grading scale to calculate your final grade. Some schools employ letter grades (ex. A, B, B-, etc...) while others use a point system (ex. 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, etc...). These scales all correspond with assigned percentages that work in relation to the total number of points that can be achieved in a class.\n\n\nThese scales may also vary, depending on your school. For example, some schools may assign plus/minus grades, and some may not. Some may use a ten-point scale (e.g., anything between 90-100 is an A, anything between 80-89 is a B, etc.). Others may use a seven-point scale (e.g, 97-100=A, 93-96=A-, 91-92=B+, etc.). This may also vary depending on your professor's preferences."}

You can draw inspiration from a classic model like a Fender Telecaster or a Gibson SG, or make your own unique design. Once you\u2019ve settled on a design, draw the body, full scale, on paper, and cut it out.The guitar body shape can be rounded, like a Gibson Les Paul or a Fender Stratocaster, or angled, like a Gibson Explorer or Flying V.\nYou can also choose a unique shape for your guitar, such as a square or circle.\nSome guitarists prefer a single cutaway to access the higher frets, some like a double cutaway, or you might choose not to have a cutaway at all.;\n, Many electric guitar bodies are made of swamp ash, alder, mahogany, or maple. Common woods for guitar necks include maple and mahogany. Rosewood or maple are standard choices for fingerboards.Some of these woods are rare or protected, and hard to come by. You can experiment making an electric guitar with any kind of wood you would like, however.\nThere is room for variation in terms of the thickness of an electric guitar body. Select a wood size based on the thickness of an existing guitar, or on what feels comfortable to you.\n There\u2019s a lot of variety in terms of the looks and capabilities of the parts you\u2019ll need for your guitar. You can choose based on the kind that existing guitars you like use, or experiment with something new. You can easily buy the equipment you\u2019ll need from most guitar shops or online. For an electric guitar, you\u2019ll need:One or more pickups (single coil or humbuckers)\nA bridge\nTuning pegs\nA nut\nVolume and tone controls and knobs\nA pickup selector switch\nAn input for a \u00bc inch cable\nA pickguard (optional)\nStrap pegs (optional, but recommended)\nA truss rod (optional, but recommended)\nFret wire (if you are building your own neck)\nStrings\n\n, Unless you have a lot of skill and experience in woodworking, it is recommended that you buy a pre-made neck. Since the neck is often considered the most complicated part to make, you might consider purchasing one and building the rest of the guitar yourself. You still do the rest of the work yourself., If you purchase a pre-manufactured neck, building an electric guitar doesn\u2019t require highly sophisticated tools or expertise, but the process isn\u2019t exactly beginner level, either. You\u2019ll need to know how to saw, drill, sand, and solder, and have tools capable of fulfilling these tasks.It\u2019s possible to create an electric guitar using hand tools alone. However, having access to an electric jigsaw, drill press, and router will make things much easier and faster.\n Several companies produce electric guitar kits that include all of the parts you\u2019ll need, prepared and ready to assemble. If you just want to get your feet wet, these can be a good choice. While you won\u2019t get the full experience of making a guitar from scratch, you\u2019ll still get the satisfaction of putting it together and finishing it yourself., Lay the cut-out of your guitar body design on the wood you selected, and trace the design onto it. Use a jigsaw (or another saw) to cut through the wood, following the outline you drew.Sand the sides of the body blank after cutting it out. If you would like to round off the top and bottom edges of the guitar, use a sander for that as well.\n Draw a line down the center of the body blank for reference. Then, draw marks on the body blank to identify where you want hardware like volume controls and the pickups to go.You can position things like volume and tone controls, the pickup selector, and the plug input more or less wherever you like. Follow the design of an existing guitar, or choose what feels comfortable to you.\nPickups should sit under the strings, centered with the fretboard. Mark the position of the pickups by referencing the center line you drew.\nThe bridge needs to be positioned so that the distance between it and the nut on the neck correspond to the scale length of the neck, which varies somewhat depending on the guitar. If you purchased a pre-manufactured neck, use its scale length to position the bridge accordingly. Otherwise, most guitars have scale lengths ranging from 24-26 inches.\n You\u2019ll need to make a cavity (a hole that goes partly through the body of the guitar) in the back of the guitar to fit the electronics for the volume, tone, pickup selection controls. You will cover it later with a bit of material (usually hard plastic). You\u2019ll also need one cavity in the front of the guitar for each of its pickups. Rout the pickup cavity (or cavities) to the depth recommended by the manufacturer.You will also want to rout a cavity where the neck will attach to the body that is wide enough and deep enough to secure the parts together.\n Use the marks you made earlier as a guide. The number and position of the holes you\u2019ll need will depend on the exact hardware you\u2019re using. Generally, however, you will need holes:For the bridge hardware\nFor the volume, tone, and pickup selector controls\nTo allow the pickup wires to pass from the front cavity to the back one\nTo fit the cord input in place\nFor the strap pegs (if you are using them)\n\n, Much of the creativity that comes from making your own guitar shows in the way the body looks, so use your imagination here. The possibilities are endless! You might try:An oil finish to give your guitar a natural look\nA colorful paint and either a high-gloss or matte finish\nMultiple colors to create a striking pattern\nPainting an image or design on the body for a standout look\n\n, If you purchased a pre-manufactured neck (recommended), skip this step. If not, you\u2019ll need to cut the guitar neck to the width and thickness you prefer. Leave the headstock end wider to accommodate the tuning pegs. Round off the back of the neck (using a belt sander, for instance) until it has a comfortable profile.Neck widths are usually about 1.5\u20131.75 inches (3.8\u20134.4\u00a0cm) at the nut, and widen slightly as the frets get higher.\nMake the headstock whatever contour you like.\nRouting a hole through the length of the neck to insert a truss rod is recommended, but not required.\nIf you are adding a fingerboard to your neck, cut a thin piece of wood to the same width as the neck, and glue it on top. Round the edges of the fingerboard to give it a \u201cradius.\u201d\nCut fret wire to size for each fret, then gently tap the frets in place, then file their edges smooth. Measurements need to be highly precise, so use a spacing template (available online).Glue the nut where the fingerboard meets the headstock.\nAttach the tuning pegs to the headstock, drilling holes if necessary.\n Attach the neck to the body where you previously made a cavity for this purpose. You can glue the neck in, or run bolts through the back of the body and the neck to fix it in place., There are a number of types of bridges, so the exact directions for attaching yours will depend on its design. The simplest varieties, however, simply require a few screws to fix the bridge in place.\n Run the pickup wires through the holes you previously drilled. Drop the pickups into the cavities on the front of the guitar body, and fix them into place with the screws provided by the manufacturer. Do the same for the volume, tone, and pickup selector controls, as well as the input for the guitar cord., The pickups you purchased should come with a schematic that shows exactly how to connect these to the controls and to the input for the guitar cord. Follow this schematic, using an ordinary electronics soldering iron to complete the job. Wrap any wiring connections with electrical tape, unless the manufacturer\u2019s instructions suggest another method.\n\n\nOnce the electronics are in, cut a piece of hard plastic to cover the cavity you created in the back of the guitar body. Fix it in place with small screws.\n Use your favorite string gauge. After they\u2019re in place, try playing your guitar a bit unplugged to make sure everything feels right. Then, plug your guitar in and play. If all has gone well, the guitar is done!You might need to make small adjustments to perfect the guitar's intonation, such as changing the bridge pins or saddle height. If you need help doing this, take your guitar to a local shop.\n\n"}

However, recent research examined diets of indigenous populations around the globe where there was no acne in the teenage subpopulations. When diets were compared between the controls in the US who had more than 70% acne and the indigenous teenagers without acne, it was clear that milk products in combination with too much sugar were missing in the diets of the acne free teenagers, but present in the US controls.This explains why for some people, certain foods including dairy products and diets high in processed sugars increase the risk for acne. These foods increase inflammation and provide an environment where bacteria can flourish.Studies have indicated that low glycemic index foods (GI) reduce the severity of acne.Low glycemic index foods are those foods that release sugars into your blood more slowly. The lowest GI foods are:Bran cereals, Natural Muesli, rolled oats\nWhole wheat, pumpernickel, whole grain breads\nMost vegetables except beetroots, pumpkin and parsnips\nNuts\nMost fruit except watermelon and dates. Mango, banana, papaya, pineapple, raisins, and figs have medium GI.\nLegumes\nYogurt\nWhole grains are low- to- medium GI. The lowest GI are found in brown rice, barley, and whole grain pasta.\n The vitamins that appear to be most important for the skin are vitamins A and D.Work the following foods into your diet:Vegetables: Sweet potato, spinach, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, red peppers, summer squash\nFruit: Cantaloupe, mangoes, apricots\nLegumes: Black-eyed peas\nMeat and Fish: beef liver, herring, salmon\nFish: Cod liver oil, salmon, tuna\nDairy: Milk, yogurt, cheese\n\n, Though many foods are fortified with Vitamin D, it doesn\u2019t exist in abundance in the foods we eat. While you can try to increase your Vitamin D levels through eating, the single best way to get Vitamin D is to expose your skin to the sun 10-15 minutes a week. Sunlight triggers Vitamin D production by the skin.Do not wear sun screen, and leave as much skin exposed as you feel comfortable with.\n\n\nDo not over-expose your skin to sunlight without sun screen, as it is very dangerous and could lead to cancer., Studies suggest that omega-3 fats can benefit those with acne.Omega-3 fats limiting the body\u2019s production of leukotriene B4, which increases sebum production and leads to inflammatory acne.

Use a back and forth pattern. If you're using embossed tiles, make sure to spread enough adhesive to fill in the back of the tin, because tin tends to dent.If you are using adhesive tape, put a continuous strip on the top and bottom of your tin tiles., Once you've put the tin tile against the wall, press hard with both of your palms.

{"title": "How to Care for Arthritic Hands1", "summary": "take recommended medications.\ntreat pain with injections.\nsplint your hands and/or wrists.\nconsider surgery for your affected hand.\nattend after surgery hand therapy.", "article": " Your doctor may recommend that you take certain medications on a regular basis to help reduce the inflammation and pain caused by the arthritis. Some of these medications, like ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory), does not require a prescription and can be taken several times a day. The following medications have been known to relieve the pain and inflammation caused by arthritis:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \u2014 otherwise known as NSAIDs, these types of medication include ibuprofen (e.g Advil) and acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol). Most NSAIDs are available in some form as over-the-counter medications, but you can also get a prescriptions for stronger versions of NSAIDS (i.e. Tylenol 3s and 4s, etc.)Corticosteroids \u2014 mainly used to control inflammation. These drugs are administered with an injection. Oral corticosteroids may be given for rheumatoid arthritis.Analgesics \u2014 target only pain relief and do not control inflammation and include acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol). Analgesics are also available in a cream form (e.g. Voltaren) and can be rubbed into the skin around the area that\u2019s painful. Low level analgesics (like regular strength Tylenol) and a variety of the cream versions, are available over-the-counter. Stronger versions of analgesics are available by prescription.Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs \u2014 otherwise known as DMARDs, these drugs actually work to modify your arthritis. DMARDs are available only by prescription.Biologic response modifiers \u2014 used mainly for rheumatoid arthritis, they work to block specific steps in the inflammation process of your body. Biologics are only available by prescription.Osteoporosis medications \u2014 help to slow bone loss or help to build new bone. There are a number of drugs that are used to treat osteoporosis and all are available only by prescription.;\n, If anti-inflammatory medications are not successful, your doctor may recommend getting regular injections at the site of your arthritis. These injections usually include an anesthetic and a steroid, and they can last for several months.While you may find injections successful, they are only meant to be a temporary measure and cannot be continued indefinitely.\n Splints can also be used on your hands and wrists in addition to, or instead of, medication or injections. A splint will help support and stabilize your hand or wrist in order to reduce the stress placed upon it by certain activities.Splints are normally worn for a limited time every day, as opposed to all day, every day. Most arthritis sufferers tend to use splints when performing specific activities which may cause them more pain, such as typing, driving, painting, gardening, etc.\n Unfortunately medications and injections do not always work as well as we\u2019d like. Another option to consider is hand surgery. The exact type of surgery will be catered to your specific situation, but the main goal of the surgery is to reduce the pain over the long-term.Surgery where the joint can be saved or reconstructed is always the first, and best, option. However, if it isn\u2019t possible to save the joint as is, your doctor may perform a joint replacement or a fusion.\nFusing the joint(s) together can significantly reduce the amount of pain you experience, but it will permanently remove any movement you have in that joint. The fact that the joint cannot move is how the pain is eliminated, as the joint can no longer rub together.\nJoint replacement involves replacing your original joint with a man-made joint. Man-made joints usually consist of plastic, metals or ceramic and can last a very long time. A joint replacement will not only eliminate the pain you\u2019re experiencing, but it will allow you to continue to use your hand normally.\n No matter what type of surgery you may have, you will need to perform hand therapy (a type of physical therapy) afterwards. Initially after surgery you may be asked to wear a splint full-time in order to limit the movement of your hand while it heals. You may also need to change the activities you perform until your hand or wrist is strong enough.Most people can recommence normal activities approximately 3 months after surgery. However, the speed of your recovery is high dependent on the effort you put towards taking care of your hand or wrist.\n\n"}

Your own milk is sterile and the most natural liquid to apply over the skin that will not adversely impact your baby.Manually express a little milk and let it air dry on your nipple.\nBesides providing a natural way to soothe the skin, the human breast milk is also thought to carry antibacterial healing properties.However, you should not let your skin bathe in the breast milk for extended period of time if you have thrush. Yeast can thrive in the milk if allowed to do so and this can worsen the infection.;\n, Make sure to clean your nipples with water and a gentle soap after breastfeeding to wash off your baby's saliva and dried milk.\n\n\nRinsing off your nipples after each feeding will decrease a risk of infection, which can lead to cracked and sore skin.Use only unscented, gentle soap to wash the skin to reduce irritation. Be sure to rinse off the soap entirely as leaving a residue can irritate the skin and worsen the problem.After washing your nipples, gently pat them dry with a soft cloth and allow them to air dry. This can help reduce soreness and prevent irritation caused your bra or a shirt.You can also keep your irritated nipples from coming into contact with a constricting bra by putting them into doughnut-shaped nipple shells., You may want to check out over-the-counter ointments to help soothe cracked nipples. Make sure you evaluate their ingredients, as they should be all natural and contain no chemicals that are unsuitable for your baby.\n\n\nChoose antibacterial ointment to soothe and treat skin that is infected. Your lactation specialist or doctor may also recommend a prescription strength ointment.Olive oil or medical-grade lanolin ointments can also help promote healing of your cracked nipple and keep it from forming a scab. Because the ingredients are all natural, you do not need to worry about washing it off between feedings.A moisture barrier may also help speed the healing of your sore nipple, as research has shown that keeping a cracked nipple naturally moist and slowing natural evaporation promotes healing., You can use a cold compress or a moist dressing to treat your cracked skin. Both techniques can help relieve irritation, pain, and inflammation.\n\n\nHydrogel pads can be applied to your nipples between feedings to keep them from drying out. Make sure that you do not touch your nipple tissue directly with your fingers, as you could possibly transfer bacteria to it.Avoid using hydrogel pads if you already have a fungal or bacterial infection on your nipple, as enclosing your nipple in a moist environment can worsen the infection.You can make a cold compress using ice or purchase an ice pack from the drugstore. A cold compress helps soothe your nipples and can decrease inflammation., Some practitioners may recommend using nipple shields, which are silicone shields placed over your nipples during breastfeeding. Be aware that these devices can do more harm than good if used improperly, including increasing your baby\u2019s difficulty to latch.Get help from your doctor or lactation educator so you know how to use them correctly.\n\n\nIneffective latching and breastfeeding due to the nipple shields can cause your nipples to be pinched, creating a larger injury., A saline solution that is about as salty as tears can be prepared at home to clean and disinfect cracked nipples.\n\n\nMix \u00bd tsp of table salt in a cup of sterile water. Bathe your nipples for no longer than 5 minutes in the solution.Rinse your nipples in sterile water to remove the salty taste before nursing your baby., Sore nipples are almost unavoidable in the first few weeks after delivery, as your baby's mouth is very small. Poor latching and positioning are typically the main causes of sore and cracked nipples during nursing. However, there are other causes of sore nipples you should be aware of.\n\n\nYour baby may get a yeast infection in her mouth or throat, known as thrush, and pass this onto you during nursing. Symptoms of thrush include painful, and sometimes cracked nipples, as well as redness and itchiness of the breast. If you suspect thrush, seek medical treatment for both you and your baby.Mastitis, a bacterial infection of the milk ducts, can cause your nipples to become cracked and your ducts to become too inflamed to let milk down effectively. This infection can also result in a fever, chills and body aches with more serious complications.You may suffer from nipple discomfort due to Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, which causes your nipple to become blue or white after a feeding session and you experience pain as blood flows back to your nipple., If nipple soreness persists after the first week of nursing or if you think your nipples might be infected, seek help from a lactation consultant or doctor. You might have another underlying problem in addition to a poor latch from your baby.If you experience any symptoms of infection, including bleeding or oozing nipples, tenderness around the areola, pain during or after nursing, fever and chills, talk to your doctor."}

Watch the corners of the clippers to make sure that you don\u2019t poke your horse with them.\n Work in long, narrow sections to get the most even results. Overlap each new strip of hair your clip off, so that you don\u2019t have any uneven patches. When you reach a whorl in the coat, clip out the hair from different angles to remove it all.\n When you clip near the mane and tail, wrap it and move it to the side so that you don\u2019t accidentally cut any long hairs.

Be sure to switch to the smaller clipper when clipping the face and other sensitive areas.\n If you\u2019re not doing a full clip, there will be areas of the horse which still have hair, and some of that will be a bit long. Use a pair of cutting shears to trim down extra long hair, typically around the legs.\n The hair left on the ground will need to be swept up and removed. Horsehair does not decompose quickly though, so it should not be put in a manure or compost pile. Instead, simply toss it out with your regular garbage.\n Your horse won\u2019t be used to the stark temperature change as a result of having much less hair, so they will need to be blanketed whenever they are put out. In general, if you need a thin coat, put a thin blanket on them. If you\u2019re very cold, they\u2019re also going to need a thick winter blanket."}

Other common symptoms of PPD include feeling anxious, wanting to isolate yourself from family and friends, and having a hard time bonding with your baby., Postpartum PTSD isn\u2019t the same thing as postpartum depression, but the symptoms can be similar. Postpartum PTSD is caused by a difficult or traumatic birth experience, such as an emergency C-section.Women who have experienced trauma in the past are more likely to develop postpartum PTSD.\n Let your doctor know that you have PTSD and you\u2019re concerned about developing postpartum depression. They can help you come up with a plan for staying mentally healthy after you have your baby.For instance, your doctor might recommend counseling or start you on a low dose of antidepressants at the end of your pregnancy.\n Before you have your baby, reach out for help.

It is a life transition that, even though it is temporary, is worth gathering support for. Find a local gathering of breastfeeding moms to get encouragement for the days when it is hard to persevere through breastfeeding. Finding other moms who have breastfed twins is also a good idea.\n\n\nDon\u2019t forget to talk to a lactation consultant if you get discouraged or have a question. You may have met a lactation consultant when you were in the hospital giving birth. You can also talk to other moms in order to find a good one in your area.\nYour pediatrician can also provide support and resources for you.\n Setting goals for breastfeeding twins will help you stick to it on days when you feel overwhelmed. For example, you could decide to breastfeed for six months and then switch to formula.\n\n\nYou could also set up a feeding once a week or more where your partner feeds the babies pumped breast milk while you take a break.\n Making the transition to breastfeeding twins can take a few weeks, especially if you have other children. It is wise to get help with your household chores until you have an established breastfeeding routine so that you don\u2019t get overwhelmed.\n In order to continue to produce a good milk supply, and to stay motivated to breastfeed, you must take care of your body. For the first few weeks of your twins\u2019 lives, you are also recovering from giving birth (unless of course you have adopted), so you need to make sure your body heals properly.\n\n\nDrink a lot of water, eat a balanced diet heavy in lean protein, and rest when your babies sleep.\nEating foods heavy in calcium, vitamin D, iron, and folic acid can help both your milk and your body.\nGet as much rest as you can. If necessary, ask loved ones to take care of the babies so that you can get the rest that you need.\n At some point, once breastfeeding is firmly established, you may want to consider something called \u201ccombined feeding\u201d\u2014a combination of breastmilk and formula. This can be helpful in giving you more free time or allowing you to go back to work during the day. Babies also tend to start consuming a high volume of milk as their sucking reflexes strengthen, so adding formula can give your body a break.Breastmilk is the best nutrition for a newborn baby, and making the decision to breastfeed twins is commendable because of how much time it takes, especially in the beginning.Some twins, especially if they are born prematurely, may need special formulas or supplements in addition to breast feeding. However, most babies can still have at least some breast milk, even if they do need supplements to their diet.\n\n"}

Not to make fun of the person or act like you do not care about their loss, but the sudden change of subject to something sad is awkward for you, so you feel like laughing or getting out of the conversation. Although you may not notice it, something triggers you to do so. Think first, then react. Listen closely to what the person says. Imagine immediately if you were in their situation. What would you do? Would you want someone laughing at you if your mother died? Listening to the person, then putting yourself in their place will help you realize that it's not something unimportant and funny.\n If you need inspiration, the daily news is usually full of unfortunate events that will suffice to calm you down. Think about something that makes you want to cry. Although this can be unpleasant, it usually takes care of the uncontrollable urge to laugh. If sadness doesn't work, fear is also extremely effective. Think of a scene from a horror movie you just saw or a car accident. This is physically proven to work because the adrenaline (the fear hormone) released from your brain when you have these thoughts will block out the endorphins (the happiness or laughing hormone). It may take some practice to convince yourself enough of the fear, but once you have mastered it, it's very effective.\n Bite each side of your mouth together, so that the edge of your lips aren't rising up to make you smile or laugh. Hold your breath when you are about to laugh. This can act as a distraction, helping you beat the urge to laugh out loud. If you still squeeze out a smile which other people tend to notice, press your lips together so it doesn't look like you're smiling. Sometimes when you hold your breath though, it just squeezes the laugh out even louder or you laugh at yourself, so be cautious.\n Try exhaling as much of the air as possible from your lungs. This removal of the air will not allow the laugh to continue and make it stop. This usually works best when combined with the coughing technique mentioned above. A combination of techniques is often the best!\n\n\nClose your mouth and breathe heavily through your nose, as if you are laughing, just without opening your mouth. It can be covered up as a cold or something of that nature.\n\n\nOpen your mouth wide and let the laughter out silently without smiling; this may look odd but it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPush your tongue against the top of your mouth, and at the same time pushing your mouth shut slightly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise your jaw muscles to relieve any tension and wear out the muscles.\n Do it gently, of course! Here are some biting techniques that may work for you:\n\nTry biting down on your lower lip. Then, laugh all you want without opening your mouth. People will think you are crying and trying to hold it back. Try scrunching up your face, too. But, after you are done, don't just stop. Inhale a few times as if you are hyperventilating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBite your tongue and pull your cheeks back or, if you are at a funeral or something serious, hold your hands up to your face, and smile and laugh as much as you want but, try to make the laughing sound like you're crying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBite the inside of your cheeks.\n Try a method for thinking about something else, or self calming. Some approaches that may help include:\n\nCount backwards from 10 to 1. If this doesn't work, try again. Even forward counting can help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a multiplication table in your head. This is guaranteed to work, but it may require some practice. In case if you never noticed, when we hear a joke or see something funny, we keep recreating the joke/scene in our minds over and over, and that's why we keep laughing. So the best way to stop laughing is to get the joke out of your head. Doing some mental calculation will, undoubtedly, require all your attention. Just try doing a multiplication, reading a book or thinking about anything else at the same time, you'll see it's impossible. However, if you're trying to hold laughter in a school play or something of that sort, where you still have to think about what to do next, you're going to have to learn not to look down or look distant while you're doing the math, and, also, to start doing the calculations again as soon as you feel like laughing, but without stopping what you're doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to remember something, anything. Try to remember the names of all your friends and relatives, for instance, or trying to list all the songs of your favorite music album. Whatever uses your brain capacity and takes your attention away from the joke will help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse reverse psychology on yourself. By telling yourself something like, \"This is funny! Laugh some more!\", you end up finding that whatever you were laughing at, is not so funny anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSing a song to yourself and concentrate on the lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Knowing when a given autograph was produced will help you spot a fake. Compare another autograph from the same time period to the one you\u2019re, Knowing the provenance of the autograph means tracing the line of ownership back to the moment when the autograph was created. Ask the current owner of the autograph how they came to acquire it. If they claim they are not the first owner of the autograph, follow up with the person who sold them the autograph to find out more about its origin. Continue down the chain of ownership as far as possible.If you have a video or a photo that depicts the creation of the autograph you\u2019re trying to verify, your job will be much easier. Just compare the autographed item in the video or photo to the actual object. If the two are different, you\u2019ve spotted a fake.\nIf you\u2019ve nobody to talk to about an autograph\u2019s provenance, look for corroborating documents. For instance, if someone autographs a particular item and then writes in their diary that they did so, you could use that information to establish that the autograph is authentic.\nYou could also, in some cases, ask the supposed author of the autograph directly if they recognize the autograph as their own.\n If you\u2019re evaluating an autograph of historical significance, the paper or ink from that era should be identifiable as such. Ensure that the ink or paper from the era in which the autograph was supposedly created is historically accurate.Paper produced between 1900 and 1945, for instance, was far less absorbent than paper today. If the autograph you\u2019re evaluating purportedly dates from that period but shows a \u201cbleeding effect\u201d (an uneven ink trim around each character), the autograph was likely produced by a newer pen pressed against older paper, which was less absorbent than modern paper.Like most efforts to spot a fake autograph, this is far from foolproof. Forgers often go to great lengths to produce fake autographs. They might use special inks or blank pages that really date from the historical period in which the autograph was allegedly produced. They might also artificially age photos or papers to create the appearance that they are older than they really are., Almost every industry that produces autographed collectibles \u2013 sports, film, TV, and so on \u2013 also has at least one independent autograph authentication service. For instance, if you\u2019re interested in autographs of golfers, you should get authenticated through the Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) or a similar organization., The only real way to identify whether a particular autograph is the product of an autopen or other machine signature device is to compare it to a known machine-produced signature. Lay the two signatures over each other on a light table or beneath a strong light source. If they align perfectly, both were machine-produced.Many people who use autopens or other mechanical signature machines to sign things have more than one signature loaded in the machine\u2019s memory. In order to know for sure that a particular autograph was or was not produced by a machine, you need to know how many machine-produced versions of their autograph the individual in question used. Then, compare your autographed object or document against all known variations.\nIt is possible to have an authentic document that has been \u201csigned\u201d by autopen. In other words, a machine-signed letter from the president still qualifies as an example of presidential correspondence (though it will fetch far less than a document containing a hand-signed autograph).Machines that mechanically reproduce signatures are often used in business and government. Machine signatures are also found on books, sporting equipment, and photos.\n\n"}

For a human used to ordinary decimal subtraction problems, this is probably the more difficult method to use, but could be useful to understand as a programmer.We'll use the example 101 - 11 =\u00a0?\n\n\n, For example, convert 101-11 to 101-011 so that both have three digits.\n\n\n101 - 011 =\u00a0?\n\n, Change all the 0s to 1s and all the 1s to 0s in the second term. In our example, the second term becomes: 011 \u2192 100.\n\n\nWhat we're actually doing is \"taking the one's complement,\" or subtracting each digit in the term from one. The \"switching\" shortcut works in binary, since the only two possibilities result in switching the term: 1 - 0 = 1 and 1 - 1 = 0.\n Once you have the \"reversed\" term, add one to the result. In our example, we get 100 + 1 = 101.\n Use binary adding techniques to add the new term to the original term, instead of subtracting:\n\n\n101 + 101 = 1010\nIf this does not make sense to you, review how to add binary numbers.\n This method should always end up with an answer one digit too long. For example, our example problem involved three-digit numbers (101 + 101), but we ended up with a four digit solution (1010). Simply cross out the first digit, and you'll have the answer to the original subtraction problem:1010 = 10\n\nTherefore, 101 - 011 = 10\n\nIf you don't have an extra digit, you tried to subtract a larger number from a smaller one. See the tips section for how to solve problems like that, and start again.\n This method is called the \"two's complement\" method, since the \"reverse the digits\" steps results in the \"one's complement,\" and then the number 1 is added.If you'd like a more intuitive understanding of why this method works, try it in base ten:\n\n\n56 - 17\nSince we're using base ten, we'll take the \"nine's complement\" of the second term (17) by subtracting each digit from nine. 99 - 17 = 82.\nChange this into an addition problem: 56 + 82. If you compare this to the original problem (56 - 17), you can see that we've added 99.\n56+82=138. But since our changes added 99 to the original problem, we'll need to subtract 99 from the answer. Again, we'll use a shortcut, just like in the binary method above: add 1 to the total number, then delete the digit on the left (which represents 100):\n\n138 + 1 = 139 \u2192 139 \u2192 39 This is finally the solution to our original problem, 56-17.\n\n"}

Seek out people you wouldn't normally get a chance to meet, especially people employed in low-paying jobs or struggling at the bottom of these hierarchies. This doesn't make you a socialist, but it may teach you a more realistic and detailed understanding of the social experiences socialism seeks to eliminate.\n\n\nUnderstand that most socialists desire to restructure society to eliminate this type of suffering, not just alleviate it with private charity.;\n, Socialism has long been associated with fighting oppression of all types, not just those types based on economics or class divides.\n\n\nConsider learning about and involving yourself in movements that work to end anti-immigrant hatred, racism, and discrimination based on sex, gender, or sexuality.Even movements that are rarely discussed in mainstream society, such as the campaign against inhuman prison conditions, have been championed by socialists for over a century.Consider joining an organization that educates people on these topics, protests them, and/or helps oppressed people.\nSpeak out when you witness discrimination occur. File a discrimination charge against employers when appropriate, following these guidelines for the U.S. or the E.U.\n If you work at a small business or are well-respected at your workplace, you may be in a position to argue for a more equal payment structure, or for giving lower-status employees a chance to contribute ideas and assist in decision-making. Even if you are not in a position to accomplish this, you may be able to start a petition or lawsuit against oppressive management decisions, such as mistreatment of employees or discriminatory hiring practices.\n\n\nSmall business owners looking to retire or move on may be convinced to sell their business to their employees. While this can take on several different forms depending on the legal path the owner decides to take, this can be the basis for a full worker cooperative, or at least a more equal system in which the current employees share the profits between them., Historically, the relationship between trade unions and socialists has been controversial, with a long history of both cooperation and strife.However, even if you join an anti-socialist labor union, you may find non-socialist allies for certain common goals, such as workers' rights.\n Many unions, ironically, are organized in top-down, privilege-based hierarchies, or are ineffective at defending their members' labor rights. If you are working on the union staff, and demonstrating that you are a serious and effective union member, you may be able to alter this situation. Note that arguing socialism may be less effective than training all union members in union operations, and encouraging them to involve themselves in meetings and strategy discussions.\n\n\nSome socialist organizations recommend working in the rank-and-file of the union staff for six months before trying to make big changes., There are many types of cooperatives, but the basic idea is a community that makes decisions and shares benefits on an equal basis. This could be a group of friends who distribute income and resources evenly, or a more worker cooperative in which all workers have equal decision making power in a business-like entity.\n\n"}

Some of the different types of perfectionism include:Neurotic Perfectionism. These types of perfectionists crave the approval of others and they may worry incessantly that they will not get it. For example, a neurotic perfectionist might spend hours on a relatively unimportant email to his or her boss and agonize over every word and phrase.\n\nNarcissistic Perfectionism. These types of perfectionists rely on the opinions of others for their sense of superiority. They are also fond of rules and order. For example, someone who is a narcissistic perfectionist might show off her knowledge of a procedure or rule to gain the approval of her coworkers or superiors.\n\nPrincipled Perfectionism. These perfectionists are driven by morality and ethics. They might even try to impose their morality and ethics on other people in the workplace. For example, a principled perfectionist who is opposed to eating meat might shame other coworkers for what they are eating during lunchtime.\n\nHyper-Attentive Perfectionism. These perfectionists focus in on minor details to an unreasonable degree, and they may be bothered by external stimuli. For example, a hyper-attentive perfectionist might become unreasonably upset if a coworker asks her a question while she is composing an email and breaks her focus.;\n, Many perfectionists are hard workers, which are admirable qualities for an employee to possess. However, some perfectionists have a tendency to hone in on small components of a project rather than looking at the big picture.Therefore, it might be helpful to select tasks carefully for these types of employees.\n\n\nGive them tasks that are detail oriented and limited in scope, so they don't get a large project bogged down by too many details. Some perfectionists may not be willing to delegate to others, so it's best to let them work independently on projects that require a unified vision to be successful.\n If your employee is a neurotic or narcissistic perfectionist, then he or she will have a strong drive to please others. Therefore, explaining how their work style is affecting the team's overall performance may be an effective way to motivate the person.Phrase it in terms that show that you realize they have high standards, and that you appreciate those high standards.\n\n\nFor example, you might say something like, \"You've got high standards, just like me, and that's what this organization needs. Just remember, good morale is critical to good production. A good rule of thumb is to give two compliments for every criticism.\"\n\n, Some perfectionists are quite ambitious and may even desire to be perfect, which is either due to internal motivation or external motivation.If the person is treating other people in the workplace poorly, then you might explain to the person that managers who demoralize their subordinates struggle to advance in the workplace.The higher a person advances in the corporate hierarchy, the more they have to compromise in order for the good of the whole.\n\n\nTry saying something like this: \"You are always trying to make sure that all the details are attended to, and that every little thing is done exactly right. That's fantastic, because people have to get the little things right before they can get the big things right. You're well on your way to big things.

The trouble is that a few bites can result in electrocution or severe burns, not to mention loss of the cord in question for your appliance. Always keep cords out of the reach of your pets and if you must have them in the open, get some cord guards from your local hardware or electrical store (even the vet might know where to get some from). And as horrible as this sounds, never touch a dead pet found with an electrical cord in its mouth; the pet may still be live and you will be electrocuted too. Turn the power off at the mains or call the fire brigade or police for assistance.;\n, Some plants are safe around pets but a lot of them are not. Unfortunately, many of the beautiful flowers in floral arrangements are deadly to our furry friends, such as lilies and hydrangeas. Poisonous plants should be kept out of reach from chewing pets or keep them out of the house altogether.\n Household chemicals are mostly hazardous if swallowed and a curious pet can easily fall prey to some nasty chemical combinations if attracted to the product or chewing the container. One problematic household item in particular is antifreeze. Antifreeze tastes sweet and is therefore attractive to pets. It will attack your pet's kidneys very quickly if swallowed, so never have it at pet level or where a pet can get to it. Lock it and all of your other chemical products up! See Protect Pets from Hazardous Household Products for more information.\n Do not leave a burning candle alone any time for any reason; this is how fires start. It is even more dangerous when pets are about - the flame can attract them to play with it, or they can accidentally brush a candle with a tail as they walk by, knocking it over. When using candles, always be present, have the pets away and preferably have at least one other person keeping an eye on the candle as well., Even pet toys can cause problems. Don't buy toys that are too small for your pet - they can be swallowed and the pet can choke. String and yarn should also be put away when you have finished playing with the kitten or puppy because the animal can become entangled in it when you are not present, or swallow it.\n Some modern heaters and fireplaces are very attractive and the ones with glass frontage are a danger to pets who do not realize the glass is present. Pets can push their noses against the glass thinking that they are sniffing at the fire, only to get a nasty burn from the hot glass. Keep a close eye on activity of pets around such a heater and around other heaters as well. Always keep a cover over any fans (hot or cold) in case a pet tries to play with the moving blades.\n\n"}

They're also low in fat. Follow your vet's instructions in terms of how much and how often to feed your bird. Usually, pelleted food should make up about 85 percent of an obese bird's diet., If it's okay with your vet, make them about 15 percent of your parrot's diet. Aim for calcium-rich dark leafy greens, protein-rich legumes, and Vitamin A-rich carrots and sweet potatoes. Birds also need carbs and fats in their diets, but they should make up a very small part of this 15 percent. Check with your vet for what's right for your parrot., Seeds provide essential fats, but there is such a thing as too much. Talk to your vet about how much your parrot needs. If your bird likes their seeds too much, ask your vet for pointers about reducing seeds without upsetting your feathered friend., Buy a larger cage for your bird. Divide the food into smaller bowls and place them at different ends of the cage. Provide a hanging rope for climbing and a rope perch to improve your bird's balance. Install stairs if your bird's wings are clipped. If your bird's wings aren't clipped, give them a flight cage outside. You can purchase any of these at your local pet store."}

Finding out which bus to catch can include:\n\n\n\nResearching online to find the routes. Many bus companies now include complete maps with route markers on them. Some will also show connections.\nPhoning the bus company and asking for advice.\nGoing to a public information counter and asking for advice.\nVisiting a tourist center and getting advice on bus routes and timetables.;\n, Many bus services now require accurate change, or at least coins so that the bus driver does not have to give change. Others do not mind giving change and some even have conductors to take care of this, such as London buses (you can't use cash on London buses). If you need to have a ticket in advance, you will have to work out where to purchase this from; it may be a ticket booth or an automatic vending machine. Again, ask about this when seeking the information in step one.\n Some buses are express, meaning they don't stop at all stops and might go right past the stop you want; if you are not sure, ask as you get on and be prepared to hop off and wait for another one.\n Depending on the type of bus and where you live in the world, the front door is not always the only, or even right, way on the bus. Some buses allow entrance via the middle doors, or the back. It can be of especial importance during crowded peak hour times to know that you can squeeze in through a different door.\n Some buses can take your bike. Don't assume this is possible though; always check beforehand. Also, put large parcels, suitcases etc. in an appropriate place after getting on a bus. Buses that go to airports and railways often have large case areas. Other buses will often have a smaller place for school packs and briefcases. And always remove your pack or large back from your back and carry before getting on. There is nothing more unpleasant than being clobbered in the face by a school bag on a student's back. Be thoughtful and considerate of others.\n If you have any difficulties using a bus, you might need to get a bus able to provide disabled access. Some buses are able to \"kneel\" to let on wheelchair. However, in many places, these buses are only assured at certain times of the day and you will need to find out about these in advance.\n Buses are a popular form of transport and often there is standing room only. If you have a genuine reason to sit when everyone else is already seated, be ready to ask people politely if someone is willing to stand up because you are \"sick/disabled/pregnant/exhausted etc.\". And be prepared for some people to be a little rude but persevere. Usually one person will feel guilty enough to give up their seat in this situation; this is why it is important not to single out one person but to address a group of seated people instead.\n Most buses have buttons or pull cords that ring a bell and alert the driver that somebody wants to get off at the next stop. If you can't reach it, ask for help from a passenger nearer to the bell or cord. And the best thing ever is to let the bus driver know in advance where you need to get off if this is your first time and you are unfamiliar with the route. That way, he or she will stop without you having to worry.\n It is really important to acknowledge the driver's care in getting you to where you want to go. A civil society that says thank you is a pleasant one to live in. It is especially important to say thank you when you catch the bus regularly and you get to know the driver well.\n Always wait until the bus is clear of the bus stop before trying to cross the ride; you can't see what is coming up alongside a parked bus and walking in front of a bus is just not a good idea. Be patient, or better still, walk to the lights to cross the road after alighting the bus.\n\n"}

Any rooms that do not need to be accessed by the construction crew should have closed doors at all times. Rooms such as bathrooms should be closed when not in use. Closing doors in your home will go a long way towards mitigating the spread of dust and debris.;\n, One of the most effective solutions for controlling construction dust is to hang plastic drop cloths around the area being renovated. Drop cloths can be found inexpensively in the painting aisle of your hardware store. You can hang them using tape or inconspicuous fasteners like staples. Consider cutting long vertical slits down the middle of the plastic sheets to allow for passage.\n The best way to do this is by opening a window and operating a fan facing the open window. This will force airborne dust outside, and keep it from entering other areas of your home due to the pressure difference.\n One of the things most easily ruined by construction dust is flooring. Hardwood floor finishes can be marred by excess dust, and construction dust can be ground deep into carpets where it is difficult to clean. Avoid this by laying down plastic drop cloths or tarps over all floors that will be exposed to foot traffic during the home renovation.\n Some construction tasks produce a large amount of dust, such as cutting wood or tile or sanding any surface. To reduce dust, many tools can be fitted with either a vacuum dust collection bag or a water cooling system. Tile saws should always be used with the water pump on, which virtually eliminates dust. Mitre saws, circular saws, and handheld sanders should be equipped with dust collection bags that reduce the amount of errant dust.\n If the heating and cooling system in your home uses ductwork to force air movement, turn the system off during the entire remodel if possible. Forced air systems readily churn construction dust up and distribute it through your entire home (bypassing closed doors and plastic sheets in the process). Turn the heating and cooling off, and consider taping plastic or paper over the registers and vents of your ducts.\n Tasks that can be done outdoors should be. This includes cutting wood or tile using a power saw. Performing these tasks outside and then bringing the cut materials inside will drastically reduce the amount of construction dust in your home.\n\n"}

You can provide this information to your inspector.In some areas, sellers are required by law to disclose certain types of defects, such as termite problems.\nEven if the seller doesn't have any disclosures, you still need to hire an inspector before buying the house. Sometimes sellers may not be aware of certain issues with the property, or may have been living with the problem for so long they don't even think about it.\n Typically, your real estate agent will have particular inspectors they use on a regular basis to conduct home inspections on behalf of their clients. They'll also know the reputations of local inspectors.If you noticed any potential problems in your personal walkthrough of the property, bring these up to your real estate agent before you place an offer on the house.\nYour mortgage broker also may have a particular inspector they want to use. If that's the case, they'll usually let you know in advance.\nTypically the buyer foots the bill for the inspection. Your real estate agent can give you a good idea of what to expect from the inspection and how much it will cost you.\n Before you hire an inspector, you need to make sure that their license is up to date and that they have experience inspecting homes such as the one you plan to purchase.Find out how long the inspector has been doing residential home inspections, and how many they've done. You also may want to find out if those houses are similar in size and location to yours.\nAsk the inspector how long they expect the inspection to take, and what parts of the house will be covered. If there's anything that you want inspected that won't be covered, you may need to hire a different inspector to go over that part of the house.\n Schedule the inspection at a time you'll be available and make arrangements to be there. The sellers may want to be there as well. Walk through the house with the inspector and have them explain what they see.The inspector likely will notice things that you didn't realize were signs of a problem when you walked through the house on your own.\nIf the inspector points out anything that you don't understand, ask them to explain the damage and what would need to be done to repair it.\n A general licensed inspector doesn't always go into detail regarding specific systems or issues. If potential problems are found, you may need to have a specialist come in and assess that damage.For example, if the home has a septic system, you may want to arrange to have that system inspected separately by a septic system expert.\nMost general home inspections don't inspect in-depth for termites. If your general inspector noticed termite damage, you should call in an expert on wood-destroying insects.\nLicensed inspectors also may not look at certain parts of the property, such as separate buildings or pools.\nAdditionally, general inspectors only look at what is visible. Any evidence of visible damage could indicate a more significant problem inside the walls or underground.\n\n"}

This is a small cap you can screw onto a Presta valve to essentially turn it into a Schrader valve. Some older bike pumps might also require you to have a Presta adapter. You can purchase one from your local cycle shop. When using a gas station pump, ask the attendant for a pressure gauge and inflate your tires in small bursts, checking the pressure after each one. Gas station pumps are extremely high pressure, and you can pop your tires if you're not careful.\nIf you're using a bike pump with two openings, the smaller one is for a Presta valve.\nSmart pumps with one opening will automatically adjust to accommodate a Presta valve.\nA pump with one opening may require you to reverse an internal rubber stop to fit a Presta valve.

Sooner than later, they\u2019ll have questions for you too!\n\n, English arguably has the most words of any language, which means that there are often multiple words that give almost the same meaning. Even if a word is a synonym for another word, that does not mean the two words are interchangeable. Subtle differences in word meanings can make a big difference when you use the words.\n\n\nFor example, the words emaciated and thin have similar meanings, but you would not use them interchangeably. Emaciated indicates that someone looks so thin that she seems unhealthy, while slim implies that one looks thin, yet still attractive and healthy.Check the definition of synonyms before you decide to use them. This will help you to deepen your understanding of the English language while expanding your vocabulary as well.\n Inconsistent ways of spelling certain sounds can make learning English a bit frustrating. When you\u2019re having trouble with a certain word, look at how it's spelled in other forms. This may even frustrate you further for a moment \u2013 but it will remind you that there are plenty of exceptions to English spelling rules, and you need to recognize this to master English.\n\n\nFor example, some words feature silent letters, such as \"knife\" and \"honor.\u201dThere are also rules for vowel order in some cases, such as \u201ci\u201d before \u201ce\u201d most of the time- (but not always!) and replace the \u201cy\u201d and add \u201cies\u201d for plural words.\n Verbs can also be challenging when you are trying to learn English. There are many verbs in the English language that have similar meanings, but the meaning of a sentence can be quite different depending on the one you choose.For example, \u201cMay I?\u201d and \u201cCan I?\u201d have different (yet similar) meanings. \u201cMay\u201d indicates that you are politely asking permission to do something, while \u201ccan\u201d indicates that you are inquiring about whether or not something is possible.\nMake sure that you familiarize yourself with common verbs to avoid making these types of mistakes.\n In spoken English, many words are not pronounced the same way even if they are spelled the same way. This means that you may end up making some mistakes with pronunciation now and then.\n\n\nFor example, the words \u201cbough,\u201d \u201ctough,\u201d and \u201ccough\u201d all end in the same four letters, but each word is pronounced differently."}

If at all possible, try to avoid going out into the sun during those peak hours. If you must go out during that time, make sure you take preventative measures to protect your skin from UV radiation., Sunscreen protects you from the sun's radiation, but not all sunscreen is the same. Many sunscreen products only protect against one type of radiation, but your skin can be damaged by both UVA and UVB radiation. Health experts recommend that you use broad-spectrum sunscreen, which guards your skin against both types of radiation.Choose sunscreen with a sun-protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher.\nSunscreen doesn't necessarily work instantaneously. Make sure you apply sunscreen about 15 to 30 minutes before you plan on being out in the sun.\nReapply sunscreen at least every two hours. If you go swimming or sweat a lot, you should reapply sunscreen more frequently.\nWhen you are around water, the reflection from the water can increase the strength of the sun's rays, increasing the chance of sun damage.\nUse sunscreen even when the day is gloomy or overcast. Applying sunscreen can also help prevent existing sunspots from becoming darker.\n In addition to wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen whenever you're in the sun, you should also wear protective clothing to limit your skin's exposure to UV radiation. Reducing exposure and protecting your skin is the only proven way to lower the chances of sunspots developing.Brimmed hats, long-sleeved shirts, long skirts/pants, and sunglasses can all help protect your skin from the sun.Choose tightly-knit fabrics, which are better at guarding your skin.\nYou can also buy clothing that is designed to protect against UV radiation. Some articles of clothing can provide ultraviolet protection factors of 50 or higher.\n Smoking (and secondhand exposure to tobacco smoke) has been linked to premature aging of the skin.Because of this, some experts advise that you should avoid smoking if you want to prevent sunspots and other skin conditions associated with aging."}

You can put all of the things on the floor or on a piece of furniture -- anywhere where they are in plain sight.Be prepared with four different boxes: a box for things you'll keep, a box for things you'll store, one for things you'll donate or sell, and the last one for things you'll throw out.\n At first, you may want to keep absolutely everything you've taken out. But remind yourself that the point of decluttering is to get rid of all of the extra things that are crowding your life. You should keep the items that you use on a regular basis, which you wear, cook with, or use for other household tasks.\n\n\nYou should keep anything you've used in the last year. If you're really trying to declutter, you can make that everything you've used in the last six months.\n The point is to get rid of any- and everything you no longer use, that has expired, is broken and can't be repaired, or just anything you generally don't use and just lays all over the place. Get rid of it. If you have an item that you haven't used in a year, have completely forgotten about, or can't even image what you'll need it for ever again, then it's time to toss it. Go through your things and ask yourself, \"Do I really need this?\" If the answer is no, or if you hesitate for more than five seconds, it's time to part with it.\n\n\nYou may save a few precious sentimental items, but don't overdo it. You can't save every little thing, and you shouldn't make excuses for why every little button and piece of lint has special meaning in your life.\nThis is a great time to get the advice of your trusted friends. They may be able to be more honest and tell you that you will never use a certain item.\n You should store any item that you will need eventually, but which you know you won't need for at least a few more months. Many of these items will be seasonal or special occasion items.\n\n\nStore your seasonal clothes. If it's the middle of summer, you can put away your winter sweaters for a few months.\nStore any holiday decorations. Put away those Halloween, Easter, or Christmas decorations and take them out only when you need them.\nStore any camping gear, ski equipment, fishing poles, or anything that you only need on vacation.\n You should sell or donate any items that you don't want/need but which still may have some value to someone. If you have clothes that are still in good condition, appliances that are still completely functional, or a nice painting that you just can't stand, then it's time to donate or sell the items.\n\n\nLook for doubles of useful items. If you have two coffee makers, two tea kettles, or twice as many lamps as you need, then start donating or selling the items. Even if they work perfectly well, you don't need two of them.\nYou can easily sell your items by putting them on craigslist or having a garage sale. You can donate anything that isn't sold.\nSelling items is rewarding, but it can take a bit of time. If you don't have the time, then just donate everything and you'll be doing a good deed.\n The \"maybe\" box is where you can place the items that you're not sure if you should store or keep the stuff. Store the stuff for now, and then come back to it in six months and throw it out if you haven't thought about it once. You may forget about the box all together -- but at least all the stuff in it will be out of your space.\n\n"}

In fact, by sticking to some very basic principles, you can invest your savings and see them grow over a long time period.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, there are a few types of options for investing. The main ones are stocks, and bonds. Stocks represent ownership in a business, and bonds represent money you lend to a business or government in exchange for regular interest payments.\nMost investors have a combination of debt and equity in their portfolios.\n Mutual funds and ETFs are similar in that each is a collection of many stocks or bonds. They provide a way to diversify your portfolio to an extent that would be impossible if you were only investing in stocks one at a time. There are some significant differences between Mutual funds and ETFs, so research both before deciding where to invest your money.\n\n\nETFs offer greater flexibility and lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds.ETFs are more tax efficient, but they see fewer capital gains than mutual funds.ETFs trade like regular stocks and their value fluctuates throughout the day. The value of a mutual fund is calculated only once a day, using the closing market prices of the securities in the fund's portfolio.Mutual funds are managed while most ETFs are not. The holdings of a mutual fund are selected by a fund manager who seeks to make the fund as profitable as possible. The manager actively monitors the market and revises the fund's assets accordingly.\n Decide if you want to use an online broker or a full service broker. A full service broker has the time and knowledge to make your investment work for you; however, they can also charge a substantial fee. If you feel you understand the market fairly well and want to manage your own portfolio, then you may wish to sign up with an online broker, such as TD Ameritrade, Capital One, Scottrade, E*Trade and Charles Schwab.\n\n\nAlways be mindful of fees before opening accounts, as well as account minimums. Brokers all charge fees per trade (ranging from $4.95 to $10 generally), and many also require a minimum initial investment (ranging from $500 to much higher).\nCurrently, online brokers that have no minimum initial investment include Capital One Investing, TD Ameritrade, First Trade, TradeKing, and OptionsHouse.If you want more help with your investing, there are a variety of ways to find financial advice: if you want someone who helps you in a non-sales environment, you can find an advisor in your area at one of the following sites: letsmakeaplan.org, www.napfa.org, garrettplanningnetwork.com. You can also go to your local bank or financial institution; however, many of these charge higher fees and require a large minimum to invest ($500,000 to $1,000,000 is common).\nSome advisors, (like a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER\u2122) have the ability to give advice in a number of areas, like investments, taxes and retirement planning, while others can only take direction but not give advice, Also important to know is that not all people who work at financial institutions are bound to a fiduciary duty of putting their client's interest first. Before starting to work with someone, ask about their training and expertise, to make sure they are the right fit for you.\n Instead of investing a large amount of money and hoping the timing works out, you can invest over time, lessening the risk of investing. This is known as dollar cost averaging (DCA).To do this, make a schedule (like once a month) to spend a fixed amount buying shares. When the price of the shares is low, you will purchase more shares; when the price is high, you will purchase fewer shares, all for the same amount of money each month.Let's say you commit to investing $100 in company X once a month. This month, the shares cost $10 each, so you will buy ten shares (for $100). Next month, the shares cost $20, so you buy five shares (for $100), an so on.\nAlways stay invested regardless of what happens to the market. There have been 11 market crashes since 1956, but every time the market has recovered to earn far more than it lost. Simply continue adding each and every month, and be comfortable with the fact that your wealth will grow over time.\n The real secret to wealth is to start investing early. Doing this will allow your wealth to \"compound\" over time. Compounding means that your initial amount will earn interest, then the next year, interest will be earned on your original amount plus the added interest.For example, if you invest $100 and it earns 5% in a year, you would have $105. The next year, you would earn 5% on $105. This means you would would have $110.25. The next year, you would earn 5% on 110.25, and so on.\nThe results over time are incredible. If you invested $1,000 a month starting 30 years ago, you would have $1.8 million today. This is the surest way to create wealth.\nLearn more here.\n\n"}

In the example above, a new directory called wikihow was created by typing: mkdir wikihow.\n In order to move into the newly created directory, use the cd or change directory command. The command is cd -> directory name. In the example, cd wikihow was typed. Now the prompt looks like this: C:\\users\\Brian\\wikihow> as shown above.\n In order to check the contents of the current directory, use the dir command.

In this example, delete newFile using the following command: del newFile. Now, check the wikihow directory contents you can see that newFile has been deleted. Clear the screen using the cls command.\n In order to complete the next step, deleting a directory, first, leave the current working directory. To do this, use a version of the change directory command. Use the cd.. command to move into the parent directory without typing the directory name. In the example, type: cd.. as shown above. Notice the prompt is now back to C:\\users\\Brian> which means that this is no longer in the wikihow directory.\n To delete a directory, use the rmdir command. You can't be in the directory that you want to delete (see step 10 above). If the directory is empty, meaning it does not contain any files, you can delete it by simply typing rmdir -> directory name. In this example the wikihow directory still contains newFile1 so the rmdir command will not work in this case. If the directory is not empty you will receive an error message as shown above.\n To remove a directory that contains files, use a modified version of the rmdir command. Use the rmdir /s command. In the example, type: rmdir /s wikihow and press the enter key. You will be prompted to confirm that you want to delete the directory by typing Y/N. Type Y for yes or N for no as shown above. When you type Y the entire directory and all of its contents are deleted from the system.\n\n"}

You shouldn't let one single difficulty affect the entire relationship.\n\n\nFind out what doesn't work in the relationship and address this specific issue by using what does work as a point of strength., What makes a reaction different from a response is its intensity and emotional subtext. Think your answers through. If one implies anger, sarcasm, accusations, it's a reaction. This will only turn communication into a table-tennis match where the goal is to win rather than to find a solution. However, a team always plays on the same side.Don't phrase your comments as judgments or blame your partner out of spite. This can only lead to further stress and misunderstanding.You can do this by focusing on future objectives rather than past actions. If you were disappointed at your partner's not doing the dishes, seize the next occasion to ask them to do the dishes, without mentioning the fact that they didn't in the past.\nDon't invalidate your partner's opinions just to win an argument. Proving yourself right might be good for your ego, but it never makes a team stronger.Understand that, when we're angry, communication follows war patterns: aggression and defense. You should avoid both, and try to bring the conversation back to equal terms. Express ideas as positive statements, without using them as weapons or shields., If your partner's tone becomes aggressive or judgmental, point it out gently and ask what was behind the message. What we say is usually not as important as why we said it. This will help you address the original source of stress, instead of spending time arguing over a harsh reply.Be tolerant if your partner has a bad reaction. If this happens repeatedly, point out this is not a useful discussion. It will never lead to a solution but only further stress., This is the golden rule of any relationship. Showing each other respect through what you say or do will decrease the level of stress, whether the source is external or internal.Respect means having equal power in a relationship. What you say or do is just as important as what your partner says or does. Stress, instead, always derives from a power imbalance. For example, one of the two partners might be overly controlling or submissive., Stress can also come from failed expectations. If that is the case, the problem is in what you expected rather than what your partner failed to provide. You chose your partner with all his or her faults and weaknesses, not as a fixer-upper. Love rests on acceptance and confidence.A consequence of acceptance is forgiveness. Your partner might have done something wrong. If your relationship is what matters the most, however, you should let go instead of holding grudges.\n Every relationship calls for continuous rearrangements and resolutions of conflicts. If communication is smooth and equal, negotiation happens as a natural process. This also means you should know how to lose or give up an argument, if that's not what matters the most to you.\n\n\nSurrendering doesn't mean passively fulfilling all of your partner's wants. It is an active choice to downsize your desire to be always right or in control. However, this must also occur on a mutual basis. If you're the one surrendering all the time, there is a power imbalance that needs to be worked out., If you think stress has had too much of an impact on your relationship and that you and your partner cannot solve the problem on your own, discuss with him or her the possibility of seeking professional help. A counselor will offer an objective point of view and help you focus on strategies to attack the problem.If your partner doesn't want to join you, you can still meet with a counselor or therapist on your own. This will provide an external outlet where you can take out your stress and get professional advice on how to deal with it."}

You may have been discouraged from dreaming, or acting in a certain way, or been accused of acting better than your status. Anyone who does that is not someone you should be around often.\n\n\nOf course, it isn't always possible to completely cut ties with these people. Some are coworkers that you need to tolerate, or close family you can't cut out. Ignore those people, and interact with them as little as you can.\n One common mark of a \"follower\" is being complacent and avoiding change, sticking to the same old drudgery.

Of course, people change their minds, but having an idea about how many children you\u2019d like will help you plan for your family effectively.;\n, If you have a spouse or partner, you should talk to this person at length about your plans; after all, having a family is something you will need to do together.

If you and your partner have different religious backgrounds, you should try to decide in advance how you will deal with that issue. In what religion will you raise your child? What will you teach your child about religion?\n\n, Pregnancy and parenthood will certainly affect your career. Depending on your current job, you may need to consider whether you will be able to balance your career obligations with your family life. If you plan to return to work after your child is born, consider:\n\n\nhow your pregnancy and postpartum recovery period will affect your career\nwhether your typical working hours will allow you to be an active, involved parent\nwho will take care of your child while you are working\nwhether you will be able to afford the cost of child care\n\n, When you have a child, your social life will change. It will be more difficult to go out at night, and you may find that you are too tired or too wrapped up in domestic concerns to try. You may see your friends less frequently, especially those who do not have children themselves. Traveling will become more complicated.\n Becoming parents may strengthen your bond and cement your relationship, but it will also change your time together. Your time and affections will have to be shared by your partner and your child or children, and your kids will often have to take precedence: their needs will come first. You will have to work harder to make time for romance and sex.\n Think about things you would like to do before you start your family, and try to do as many of those things as you can. For example, consider:\n\n\ntraveling, especially to exotic or romantic destinations\nenjoying parties and nightlife\nindulging in luxuries like massages, salon treatments, and shopping\naccomplishing health and fitness goals\nachieving important career milestones\n\n, Before you conceive, do some reading and research about pregnancy, prenatal care, baby care, and parenting.

Think about:\n\n\nwhether you have enough space. Will children have their own bedrooms? How do you feel about them sharing bedrooms? Do you have storage space for their belongings?\nwhether your home is conveniently located. Are you close to good schools and recreational opportunities? Are there parks and safe places to play?\nwhether you have family and friends nearby. When you have a baby, it can help to be near loved ones. Consider whether you want to be closer to friends and family members.\n It may be impossible to choose exactly how far apart your children are spaced, but it can help to think about whether you\u2019d like your children to be close in age or not.\n\n\nWhen children are close in age, they will have more in common and may enjoy many of the same activities. They will grow up together. However, having more than one young child at a time can mean a lot of work for you, especially during the first couple of years.\nWhen children are further apart in age, they may have less in common and seem less close as siblings. However, it may be less stressful to have only one young child at a time, and if you wait to have a second child, your first may be able to help and serve as a role model.\n If possible, before you start trying to conceive, consider working extra hours or doing side work to raise extra money. Having a family is expensive \u2013 often more expensive than people realize. Increasing your income now will help offset future costs.\n Children are expensive. You will need to buy equipment (crib, stroller, car seat, high chair, and the like), clothes, diapers, and feeding supplies. Ideally, you should research the costs of these things in your area before you start trying to conceive.\n If you plan to return to work, you will need to find quality child care. Depending on your area, you may also need to pay for your child\u2019s education once he or she reaches school age. These are major expenses that must be considered before you start a family.\n\n\nIf you do plan to use a child care provider, make sure you find one that is fully licensed. Doing so will help ensure that you can deduct some of the expense from your taxable income.\n Even if you plan to return to work after the birth of your baby, chances are that during and after your pregnancy, you\u2019ll miss work for various reasons. Additionally, depending on your job, you may not be paid for any maternity leave you take.\n When you are planning to have kids, you should start saving as much money as you can. Doing so will help offset future costs. It will also make you feel more comfortable and secure in your decision to start a family.\n If your job allows it, working from home may help you solve some of the most common problems with work-life balance while keeping all or part of your income.\n\n\nNote, however, that even if you work from home, you will probably need to pay for some child care. Otherwise, you will struggle to accomplish anything when home with your child.\n Depending on your job and your area, you may benefit from disability insurance, which could, in some situations, make sure that you continue to earn an income during your pregnancy. Do some research, and factor that into your plans.\n You may be able to purchase some items used, and you may be able to get some items free from friends and family members with older children. Look into these options before you start purchasing everything brand new.\n\n\nConsider checking Craigslist, garage sales, and second-hand stores as well. Children outgrow this equipment so quickly that it's best to be frugal.\nCar seats should always be purchased new. It\u2019s the only way to be sure that the seat has not been in an accident (which makes it unsafe for us). With other items, just use caution and make sure they conform to safety standards. You may have to do some research to be positive.\n Before you conceive, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to get standard blood tests, update your vaccinations, and discuss your overall health. Particular concerns may include:\n\n\nyour weight. Being at a healthy weight will make it easier to conceive and will help maximize your odds of having a healthy pregnancy.\nyour age. If you are over 35, you should talk to your doctor about how your age will affect a potential pregnancy.\nchronic illnesses. If you have heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other major health issue, you should discuss a potential pregnancy with your doctor. When you get pregnant, you may need to adjust your medications or take additional steps to ensure that you and your baby stay healthy.\n The hormone fluctuations associated with pregnancy can cause or exacerbate problems with your teeth and gums. It\u2019s best to see a dentist before you conceive to resolve any longstanding issues and make sure you start your pregnancy with good oral health and hygiene.\n In addition to seeing your doctor and dentist, you should make an appointment with your gynecologist before you start trying to conceive. Your gynecologist will perform a routine pelvic exam and Pap test to check for infections, signs of cervical cancer, and any other problems that might make conceiving or carrying a baby to term difficult.\n\n\nSeeing your gynecologist is especially important if you have a history of miscarriages, stillborn births, or ectopic pregnancies.\nIf you start trying to conceive and do not see results within six months to a year, you\u2019ll want to schedule another appointment to discuss potential fertility problems.\n Good nutrition is vital to a healthy pregnancy, even during the earliest period, when you may not even realize that you are pregnant. Therefore, it\u2019s best to start eating healthfully before you conceive. Aim to consume plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products.\n\n\nMake sure, especially, to get enough vitamin D, iron, calcium, and folic acid. Consider taking a daily prenatal vitamin as soon as you start trying to conceive.\n Regular, moderate exercise will improve your mood, energy levels, and blood circulation. It will also help you maintain a healthy weight.\n Smoking during pregnancy is very dangerous. The nicotine and carbon monoxide in cigarettes can cause stillborn births, premature deliveries, and low birth weights. Furthermore, smoking during pregnancy can cause problems for your child later in life: he or she may have lung, heart, or brain problems as a result. If you smoke, do everything you can to stop before you start trying to conceive.\n Like smoking, drinking alcohol is very dangerous during pregnancy. It increases the likelihood of miscarriages and stillborn births, and it also raises the risk of your child developing learning, speech, language, or behavior problems. In severe cases, heavy drinking leads to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which permanently damages the child\u2019s central nervous system. Stop drinking as soon as you start trying to conceive.\n Just as smoking and drinking can threaten your pregnancy and pose risks to your unborn children, using other drugs can also be extremely dangerous. The particular consequences depend on the specific drugs, but in general, it\u2019s best to stop putting any unnecessary chemicals into your body once you start trying to conceive.\n Before you start trying to conceive, you need to consider whether your job will affect your ability to conceive or to have a healthy pregnancy. If you have a physically demanding job or work someplace where you could be exposed to harmful chemicals or fumes, you may need to modify or quit your job.\n Once you have seen your doctor, dentist, and gynecologist and taken steps to ensure you are as healthy as possible, you can stop using contraception and begin trying to get pregnant.\n You can increase your odds of conceiving by charting your menstrual cycle and having sex during your fertile period. For most women, days 11 to 14 are the most fertile; for best results, you might try having sex every day or every other day between days 7 and 20.\n\n\nIf your menstrual cycle is irregular or you are having trouble conceiving, consider using an ovulation predictor kit. You can buy these kits online or at drug stores. They check your urine for luteinizing hormone (LH) to help you determine your most fertile days.\n\n"}

The parts of speech do not define what a word is. Instead, they describe how to use that word.\n\n\nA noun is a person, place, or thing.Example: grandma, school, pencil\nA pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun within a sentence. Example: he, she, they\n\nArticles are special terms that proceed a noun within a sentence. The three articles are: a, an, the\nAn adjective modifies or describes a noun or pronoun. Example: red, tall\nA verb is a word that describes an action or state of being. Example: be, run, sleep\nAn adverb modifies or describes a verb. Adverbs can also be used to modify adjectives. Example: happily, wonderfully\nA conjunction joins two parts of a sentence together. Example: and, but\nA preposition is used in combination with a noun or pronoun to create a phrase that modifies other parts of speech, like a verb, noun, pronoun, or adjective. Example: up, down, of, from\n\nInterjections are words that express an emotional state. Example: wow, ouch, hey;\n, Most parts of speech have additional rules governing their usage. If you want to master English grammar, you will need to study these rules in detail. Make note of the following for your studies:Nouns can be: singular or plural; proper or common; collective; count or non-count; abstract or concrete; gerunds\nPronouns can be: personal, possessive, reflexive, intensive, reciprocal, indefinite, demonstrative, interrogative, or relative\nAdjectives can be used on their own, for the sake of making comparisons, or as superlatives.\nAdverbs are either relative adverbs or adverbs of frequency.\nConjunctions are either coordinating or correlative.\nVerbs can be: action verbs or linking verbs; main verbs or auxiliary/helping verbs\nThe articles \"a\" and \"an\" are indefinite, while the article \"the\" is definite.\n Single-digit numbers (zero through nine) should be spelled out in word form, but double-digit numbers (10 and up) should be written in numerical form.All numbers within a sentence should either be spelled out or written numerically. Do not mix and match.\n\nCorrect example: I bought 14 apples but my sister only bought 2 apples.\nIncorrect example: I bought 14 apples but my sister only bought two apples.\n\n\nNever start a sentence with a number written in numerical form.\nSpell out simple fractions and use hyphens with them. Example: one-half\nA mixed fraction can be written numerically. Example: 5 1/2\nWrite decimals in numerical figures. Example: 0.92\nUse commas when writing numbers with four or more digits. Example: 1,234,567\nWrite out the numerical figure when specifying the day of the month. Example: June 1\n\n, At minimum, every sentence consists of a subject and an action. A sentence that lacks either one is a sentence fragment and is considered to be improper.\n\n\nThe subject is usually a noun or pronoun, and the action is conveyed using a verb.\nCorrect example: The dog ran.\n\nNote that the subject is indicated in italics and the action is indicated in bold print.\n\n\nIncorrect example: Yesterday afternoon.\nExpand your sentences into more complex forms after mastering this basic format.\n Within a sentence, both the subject and verb must share the same singular/plural state. You cannot use the singular form of a verb with a plural subject; a plural subject must have a plural verb.Correct example: They are at school.\nIncorrect example: They is at school.\nWhen two singular subjects are connected with the word \"and\" (he and his brother), the subject becomes plural. When connected by \"or\" or \"nor\" (he or his brother), the subject is singular.\nCollective nouns, like \"family\" or \"team,\" are treated as singular nouns and require a singular verb.\n Compound sentences are the easiest sentence form to master after the basic sentence. Use a conjunction to join two related thoughts into one sentence rather than forming two separate sentences.\n\n\nInstead of: The dog ran. He was fast.\n\nUse: The dog ran and he was fast.\n\n\nInstead of: We looked for the missing book. We could not find it.\n\nUse: We looked for the missing book but could not find it.\n A conditional sentence describes a situation in which one part of the sentence is true only if the other part is true. They can also be referred to as \"if, then\" statements, but the word \"then\" will not always appear when the sentence is written.Example: If you ask your mother, then she will take you to the store.\n\nNote, however, that it would also be correct to write: If you ask your mother, she will take you to the store.\nBoth forms are still conditional.\n Use clauses to form complex sentences. Clauses are the \"building blocks\" that can be used to expand a sentence past its basic form. They can either be independent or dependent.An independent clause has its own subject and verb. As a result, it could stand as its own sentence. Note that compound sentences, as mentioned previously, consist of independent clauses.\n\nExample: She felt sad, but her friends cheered her up.\n\nBoth \"she felt sad\" and \"her friends cheered her up\" could stand as separate sentences.\n\n\nA dependent clause is one that could not stand as its own sentence.\n\nExample: While he agreed with his brother, the boy would not admit to it.\n\nThe clause \"While he agreed with his brother\" would not make sense a separate sentence, so it is a dependent clause.\n There are multiple punctuation marks and various rules governing their usage. You should study these rules in detail, but first, you need a basic understanding of how each punctuation mark is used.Periods (.) mark the end of a statement sentence.\n\nEllipses (...) indicate that a portion of text has been removed from the passage.\n\nCommas (,) separate words or word groups when a pause is necessary but a period is inappropriate.\n\nSemicolons (;) should be used in complex sentences that lack a connecting conjunction.\n\nColons (:) are used to introduce lists within a sentence.\n\nQuestion marks (?) are used at the end of a sentence when the sentence asks a question.\n\nExclamation points (!) are used at the end of a statement sentence to indicate surprise or emphasis.\n\nQuotation marks (\") separate words spoken by another person from the rest of the text.\n\nParentheses () enclose information that clarifies a preceding thought.\n\nApostrophes (') separate contractions and show possession.\n A basic paragraph consists of three to seven sentences. Each paragraph must have a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence.The topic sentence is usually the first sentence in the paragraph. It is the most general sentence and introduces the idea you plan to discuss throughout the rest of the paragraph.\n\nExample: English grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information.\n\n\n\nThe supporting sentences explain the idea presented in the topic sentence with greater detail.\n\nExample: English grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. At the \"word\" level, one must learn about parts of speech. At the \"sentence\" level, topics like sentence structure, subject/verb agreement, and clauses must be explored. The rules governing punctuation use are also a part of \"sentence\" level grammar. Once a person starts writing larger piece, he or she must also learn about paragraph structure and organization.\n\n\n\nThe concluding sentence summarizes the information presented in the paragraph. It is not always necessary, but you should still know how to write one.\n\nExample: English grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. At the \"word\" level, one must learn about parts of speech. At the \"sentence\" level, topics like sentence structure, subject/verb agreement, and clauses must be explored. The rules governing punctuation use are also a part of \"sentence\" level grammar. Once a person starts writing larger piece, he or she must also learn about paragraph structure and organization. All of these rules define and describe how to write English correctly.\n\n\n\nAlso note that the first sentence of a paragraph should be indented a few spaces to the right of the paragraph's left edge.\n While you could technically have a paragraph that uses nothing but basic sentences, a better and more grammatically pleasing paragraph will have a variety of simple and complex sentences.\n\n\nCorrect example: I love my cat. He has soft, orange fur. On cold days, he likes to cuddle next to me for warmth. I think that my cat is the greatest cat ever, and I am really happy to have him.\nIncorrect example: I love my cat. He is orange. His fur is soft. He cuddles next to me on cold days. My cat is the greatest cat. I am really happy to have him.\n After you feel comfortable with your paragraph writing skills, try writing longer works, like academic essays. Essay writing is a separate subject, so you should study about it in greater detail. There are a few things you should keep in mind as you begin, though.\n\n\n\nOrganize your essay by writing an introductory paragraph, three or more body paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph.\nThe introductory paragraph must be a general paragraph that presents the main idea without providing detail. The supporting paragraphs must expand on this main idea with greater detail, and each paragraph should cover its own separate point. The concluding paragraph restates and summarizes the information presented in the essay and does not introduce any new information.\n The rules and information provided in this article will not teach you everything you need to know about English grammar. This article is intended to serve as a starting point in your studies. The actual subject of English grammar is much more complex, and you will need to devote a lot of time and effort if you really want to learn it.\n Some aspects will be similar while others will differ.\n\n\nWhen the rules are the same, rely on the knowledge you have of your native grammar to help you with English grammar.\nWhen the rules differ, devote more time and concentration on practicing those aspects of English grammar as you study.\n People who do a lot of reading tend to be more proficient with English grammar in their own writing and speech.\n\n\nThis does not refer to grammar books. Grammar books are helpful, of course, but the principle of this step is a different one.\nRead books, magazines, or other materials written in English that you enjoy. The more often you read, the more familiar you will naturally become with the way that grammar is used in word, sentence, and paragraph levels. Learning the rules of English grammar is an important step, but you will be able to put those rules into practice better if you are actually used to seeing proper grammar.\n If you are no longer in school, consider taking a grammar class at a community college, community center, or library. You could also look for a class online.\n\n\nFor non-native English speakers, look for classes specifically designed for students who are learning English as a secondary language. These classes are usually labeled as ESL (English as a Second Language), ENL (English as a New Language), or ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) classes.\n If formal classes do not help, find a mentor who can review grammar rules with you one-on-one. This mentor could be a teacher, professor, or professional tutor. On the other hand, it could also be a parent, sibling, friend, or other relative who has a strong grasp of the English language and is willing to help out.\n Go to a bookstore and purchase an English grammar workbook, or hop online and access some free grammar resources through the Internet.\n\n\nAs a general rule, look for Internet sources that come from educational (.edu) websites. Examples include:\n\nThe Guide to Grammar and Writing by Capital Community College Foundation (http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/)\nPurdue University's Online Writing Lab (https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/1/5/)\n\n\n\n, Above all else, practice makes perfect. The more you can practice English grammar, the better you'll get with it.\n\n"}

Then, braid them for about three inches and tie them in a second knot. You have just created one of the ends that will be tied around your wrist. Tape or pin this knot to a tabletop or your pant leg.\n Lay your strings out flat, leaving a bit of space between each piece. Start on the left side and tie basic knots across each string by laying your first string in an \u201cL\u201d shape over the string directly to the right. This should create a \u201c4\u201d shape. Take the end of this string and loop it underneath the string to the right, pulling the end through the center. This should create a loop around the 2nd string, which you should pull taut to the top of the strings. Repeat steps to finish the knot.\n Using the same string that you started with, work your way to the right side of the strings by tying knots around each of the adjacent threads. When you get to the right side (after tying knots over all the strings), let the thread go and start again on the left side. Continue the same pattern you started by starting with the 2nd thread, working until you get to the right side. Eventually you will work your way across all the strings with all four of your threads, and start the pattern over again with the original 1st thread. Make sure to keep pulling the threads taut to the top of the bracelet, so that your finished product is sleek, smooth, and flat.\n Stop your weaving pattern of the bracelet when the the striped section is long enough to wrap around your wrist. Tie a knot at the end, and then braid a 3\u201d section of string past the knot.

While there may be things that she\u2019s said or done that contributed to the rejection, or her even if her job loss or her relationship with the boyfriend wasn't ideal, unsolicited advice may be difficult for your friend to benefit from at this time.For example, this isn\u2019t the time to remind her that she spent a lot of time complaining about the job she just lost, or the man who just broke up with her.\nRejection can hurt regardless of the circumstance, so being a good listener is an effective way to help a friend cope with this initial sting.\nIf your friend says that she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing wrong, and asks you for help figuring it out, then you might offer a gentle suggestion.;\n, You don\u2019t want to be too quick to talk about the \u201copportunity for growth\u201d inherent in a rejection, but at the same time you might help your friend find ways to benefit from the experience. There are always positive aspects to any situation. Sometimes it takes a friend to help you find them.For example, if she didn\u2019t get the job she wanted, now she\u2019ll be able to attend the family vacation she\u2019d been looking forward to.\nBeing single means having more freedom. Having a story rejected for publication means being able to submit it somewhere else.\n One way of supporting your friend is to help him navigate his pain. Ask him how he\u2019s feeling, and affirm that his feelings are okay. If he knows that he can share painful things with you as a friend, without being rejected, this may help him feel better.Saying things like, \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re pretty broken up about things,\u201d can help him feel supported.\n If your friend was deeply wounded by the rejection, she may not have words to articulate how she feels. She might just want to sit quietly with you. Being present and showing that you\u2019re ready to listen when she\u2019s ready to talk will be enough.You can always offer a hug, or a gentle supportive touch.\nTalking about something other than the rejection, or doing an activity together are other ways you can offer support for a friend who\u2019s not ready to talk about her feelings yet. For example, try going on a hike, or playing video games together.\n Rejection is a side-effect of trying something new and brave. Even if it ultimately didn\u2019t work out \u2014 the guy stopped calling, she didn\u2019t get the role in the play, she was turned down for a promotion \u2014 she deserves credit for trying to get what she wanted.It can help to remind her of the chances she had of rejection. For example, writers often paper their walls with rejection letters because they are so common. Even famous writers collect hundreds of rejection slips before publication.\nIf the rejection was for something that had a low chance of rejection \u2014 an anticipated job offer, for instance \u2014 you can remind her that although she didn\u2019t get it this time, she can try again.\n After all, everyone experiences rejection, repeatedly, over the course of a lifetime. Going out for the team, applying for colleges, trying to get the perfect job, or asking out the person you\u2019ve been into all summer are all opportunities for rejection.Even though every rejection feels personal, most of the time it\u2019s just a matter of bad timing.\nIt really doesn\u2019t matter how smart, funny or talented you are \u2014 everyone will experience rejection. If it helps, find people who\u2019ve eventually succeeded and look at the number of rejections they experienced.\n It can be helpful to remind your friend that he's not the only one who\u2019s had rejection. Sharing your own rejections \u2014 the jobs you were fired from, the rejection slips you\u2019ve received, the relationships that didn\u2019t work out \u2014 can help your friend feel more normal and less alone.At the same time, you\u2019ll need to be aware that your friend\u2019s experience might be very different from your own. Don\u2019t talk too much about yourself, and don\u2019t claim to know what your friend is feeling.\nNever say, \u201cYou will\u2026\u201d or \u201cYou should..\u201d to encourage your friend. Although these phrases might seem supportive to you, they\u2019re likely to be misunderstood by someone trying to cope with rejection.\nInstead, you can share how you coped with a rejection experience similar to what your friend is experiencing, and then state that everyone has their own way to cope with rejection.\n While your friend may have qualities that could use improvement, she certainly has positive qualities too. Remind her of what others appreciate about her. Offer specific examples that she can\u2019t argue with.\n\n\nFor example, reminding your friend of her great sense of humor right after she\u2019s cracked a dark joke about her situation can help her notice the truth of your statement.\nDon\u2019t go overboard on compliments, or say things that you don\u2019t really believe. Your friend will pick up on your insincerity.\n Being able to accept the rejection will help your friend move on to the next chapter in his life. If you\u2019re helping hims to cope with the rejection, take the rejection at face value.No one can predict the future. Maybe the person offered the job will refuse it, and he\u2019s next in line. Or maybe his ex will change her mind. But holding out hope for a dramatic turnaround isn\u2019t productive or practical.\nYou don\u2019t have to insist that he definitely won\u2019t be offered the job, or that his ex won\u2019t be changing her mind. Simply stay quiet, without agreeing. He\u2019ll get the message.\n Rejection is a universal experience: some people will like us, some people won\u2019t, and there\u2019s very little we can do about it. Not every person we fall in love with will feel the same way; we won\u2019t get every job that we want.Encourage your friend to divert her attention to someone who might return her affection.\nRemind your friend of what she\u2019s done recently that has earned positive attention and praise.\n What are some of the things that your friend used to enjoy before the rejection? Find ways to get him interested in some of these things again. Make a point of spending time together, going on hikes, watching sports games together, or going to movies.If the rejection meant a loss of income, your friend may be financially stressed. Make sure that you\u2019re finding things to do together that don\u2019t require money, which may only make him feel worse.\nTry to avoid doing things together that might trigger memories of the rejection.\n Some of the signs of depression include getting angry about small things, or being uncharacteristically moody and irritable. Changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping too much or not being able to sleep, can signal depression.Your friend may not seem like herself, even long after she should be \u201cover\u201d the rejection.\nYou may notice loss of interest in things that she once enjoyed.\n If your friend is starting to talk about death and dying, listen carefully. Saying things like, \u201cI might as well be dead,\u201d or \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just end it all and put everyone out of their misery,\u201d may signal suicidal thoughts, even if said lightly.\n\n\nIf you believe your friend is in any risk of harming himself (or someone else) you should talk to him directly about this. Ask him, \u201cAre you thinking of hurting yourself?\u201d He may deny it, but he may be grateful for the opportunity to talk.\nIf you feel that he\u2019s unsafe and in a crisis situation, you should call 911 for emergency support.\nEncourage him to seek help. If your friend is suffering from clinical depression, he may not be able to recover without treatment. Talk to him about what you\u2019ve noticed, and explain why you\u2019re concerned for him. Let him know that you\u2019re willing to help him make an appointment, or attend a support group.\nRemember that you can\u2019t force him to seek help. If he\u2019s not ready to seek treatment, let him know that you\u2019ll be available to help him whenever she is ready.\n The warning signs of suicide are too often recognized only in hindsight, but they\u2019re surprisingly common. If your friend is experiencing untreated depression following her experience of rejection, she may be at risk of suicide. If you notice significant increase in the signs below, talk to a medical professional or counselor immediately. If this is an emergency situation, call 911. Some warning signs include:\n\n\nObtaining the means to commit suicide, such as stockpiling medicines (for an overdose) or purchasing a gun.\nSharply increased use of drugs or alcohol.\nGiving away one\u2019s belongings, or taking urgent steps to get all affairs in order, when there\u2019s no apparent need to do so.\nSaying goodbye to people as if they won\u2019t be seen again.\nDoing very risky or self-destructive things.\nShowing signs of personality changes, severe agitation or anxiety, especially in combination with some of the signs listed above.\n\n"}

Guys usually try to act cool and do stuff like laugh harder, try to be the center of attention, and kind of act like jocks \u2013 if they are trying to impress you.\n He (or she) sees you several times a week, including weekends. You have met most or all his friends and coworkers. Everyone has heard about you. He makes plans for the future about you two, everything from buying a house, bed sheets, fried chicken, a ring, the brake job on the car. He talks as if you two will be together forever. He takes photos of you two and they are all around his house. He is very interested in what you do, think and where you go. He\u2019s a lover.\n\n\nHow often do you think about this person? Can you ignore them or do you have to text back ASAP? Are they the first person you go to with big news (and are you)?\nA lover is someone who puts you as their number one priority, and you are more likely to spend more time together and share the same lifestyle. Lovers spend most of their time with you. They are always making plans to see you.\n Don\u2019t fall for the trap of assuming sex means you\u2019re in the lover role. Guys who don't love you and have sex with you, do not bond with you. Women have a tendency to bond more with guys when they have sex. However, sexuality is a component of most relationships that move from friend to lover.\n\n\nAnother piece of this puzzle is the lumping together of love and sex- historically, this was not always the case. If you had one-time, unplanned, casual sex with a friend, just be friends. If you date and have repeated good, exciting, and emotional sex with someone, they are a lover.\nSexual chemistry is a strong hint that he likes you for more. A friend is someone with whom we have fun and can share our deepest secrets with if we're really close with them; they are someone we go to the movies with or watch a sports game together. A lover is often just the same, only with an added sexual layer to the relationship, and an overall greater intensity. You think about them more, you feel excited and nervous in their presence etc., Jealousy can mean that a person cares in a way a friend doesn\u2019t. Friends aren\u2019t jealous if they are real friends because they want you to be happy. However, if you are jealous it could also be a sign that the love is unrequited or not returned.When your friend acts rude to a new friend whom you like, or always seems to put down the person you like, it's possible that they like you. They might be jealous and worried that person is going to take you away from them.\nDo you get annoyed or feel irritated when he/she checks another person out or says anything good about their attractiveness in front of you? If you do, he or she is probably a lover.\n Does this certain someone try to spend time with you alone? They may be a potential crush. But if they only speak to you with a bigger group of mutual friends, or are already taken, chances are, they're just a really good friend.\n\n\nWith a friend, they won't ever really act flustered around you. If you've ever been to a pool party and have that one friend who always sees you and gets flustered, that's one way to tell.\nConsider whether he or she chases you. If you don't have to do anything to chase this person because they\u2019re always around or trying to get you to hang out, they\u2019re probably interested. If you have to make any effort, they are probably not that interested.\nConsider whether your mood changes when you see this person. The feelings you get near a lover are not the same as a friend; they are closer and deeper. For example, you may feel happy around a certain friend, but with the person you love you feel as if your day has gone better by just having seen them.\nWhen you are around them, do you get butterflies or do you just wave and chat? When you sit near or next to them at the lunch table do you think about holding hands or do you think about lunch? When you see them out of school do you blush and smile or do you calmly walk over to them and start a conversation? Do you find yourself dreaming about them when in or out of school? If so, you are in love with that person.\n True love is all about a continuous sacrifice. It never ends. Your friends may not always be around, especially when your tough times start to become their tough times. But your lover will, and you may have to sacrifice a job, your health, money, time, and other things for them.\n\n\nA lover knows you more than you know yourself. A lover would argue with you but wouldn\u2019t stay mad at you because they just care too much. A lover would know your past...all the wrongs you\u2019ve done but he/she would look past it, and they wouldn\u2019t use it against you.\nA lover would care for you when you\u2019re down. That means that they bring you pizza and they would always imagine their future with you. If they want to travel to live in another country or find a new place to live in, they would always picture you with them. A lover would love you for who you are, even with your flaws.\n This is the bottom line. Someone who considers you a lover will be more invested in you, more available to you, and they will make you a priority in their life.\n\n\nHow do they talk to you? Friends will start talking to someone else even though they were just talking to you and yell a 'hi' or 'hey' to someone they are friends with while talking to you. A lover is completely focused on you. Even if someone else says hi to them or tries to talk to them, they might not even notice unless you point it out or the other person does something like snap in their face to get their attention.\nWhen your friend always seems to care more than they should, or they always tend to be worried if you\u2019re okay, they most likely like you as more than a friend (or wish you liked them as more).\n\n"}

Dremel also produces a number of other types of tools, including powered screwdrivers and scroll saws. Research which tools they're currently selling to find one that fits your needs. The price range varies so it's especially important to find out if you're getting the right tool. Options on Dremels include:Fixed or cordless models\nLightweight and mobile, or sturdier and stronger\nLonger battery life\nFixed speed (usually cheaper and easier to use) or variable speed (better for intricate grinding projects and more expensive);\n, Your Dremel will come with a variety of drill bits and other attachments, the tool, and an owner's manual. Be sure to read the manual before using your Dremel for the first time. This will also help you become familiar with the controls. Find out where the speed controls, on/off switch, and button to change the bit are located.Since your model may be different than a previous year's model, it's important to read the manual that came with your tool.\n Always wear work or rubber gloves when you run the Dremel. Gloves will keep your hands safe from debris and sharp edges. You should also wear safety glasses, especially when cutting, polishing, or grinding with the Dremel.Keep your work space clean. You should also keep children and other people away while you're operating the tool.\n To insert a bit, place the bit into the hole at the end of the Dremel and back it out slightly. Tighten the collet nut so that the bit is secure and doesn't wiggle. To remove the bit, press down on the shaft lock button while turning the collet. This should loosen the bit so you can replace it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to practice inserting and changing the bit when the Dremel is turned off and unplugged.\nSome models are equipped with collets designed for quick and easy connection and release.\nYou can also get collets in different sizes for use with different sized accessory shanks.In some cases, you will need to use a mandrel, a type of shank with a threaded head. This is a type of permanent shank for use with polishing, cutting, or sanding bits.\n You should choose your bit attachment based on the type of material you'll be working with. Dremel makes many bits with a variety of materials for almost any material. For example, for:\n\n\nCarving and engraving jobs: use high speed cutters, engraving cutters, structured tooth carbide cutters, tungsten carbide cutters and diamond wheel points\nRouting jobs: use router bits (straight, keyhole, corner, or groove). When using a router, take care to only use router bits.\nSmall drilling jobs: use drill bits (purchased individually or as a set)\n\n, Once you plug it in, turn it on to the lowest setting and practice switching to different speeds.\n\n\nTo get a feel for the Dremel, try using different grips to hold the tool. For intricate jobs, you might want to hold it like a pencil. Or, for a larger job firmly grip the tool so that your fingers wrap around it.\nUse clamps or a vice to secure the material you are working on. Check your user\u2019s manual to determine the correct speed for the job you have in mind.\n Remove the bit and place the bits back in the case. Take the time to wipe down the drill with a cloth after each use. Keeping your Dremel clean will significantly extend the life of the tool. Consult the owner\u2019s manual before disassembling the tool for major cleanings.You will need to frequently use compressed air to clean out the Dremel's air vents. This will help prevent electrical failure.\n The Dremel is lightweight and easy to maneuver, making it deal for small detailing and little cuts. It can be difficult to give smooth, long curves, because you're mostly working free hand. But, you can make several straight cuts to get the kind of edge you're looking for and then even up the edge with the sanding bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid using the Dremel for long or large cuts that would be better suited to a larger saw.\n Depending on the object or material you're cutting, secure the object with a vise or clamps. Do not hold the material you're cutting in your hand.\n A speed that is too high or too low can cause damage to your motor, the bit, or the material you're working on. If you're not sure, check your owner's manual to see what speed is recommended for your particular Dremel and material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're cutting thicker or tougher material, make several passes to cut it. If the material is too hard and thick to cut without difficulty, you may need to use an oscillating saw rather than a Dremel.\nIf you see smoke and discoloration, your speed is too high. If you hear the sound of the motor dropping or slowing down, you may be pressing too hard. Lighten the pressure and readjust the speed.\n Fit a flat saw blade onto your Dremel. Remember to put on eye and ear protection before you begin cutting the plastic. Set the speed between 4 and 8 so you have enough power, but don't burn out the motor. Sand any rough edges once you've made the cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid pressing down too hard while cutting, which can damage your Dremel and your bits.\nDepending on your project, it may be helpful to draw an outline of your cuts onto the plastic. This will make it easier to ensure your cuts are where you want them to go.\n Secure a metal cutting wheel onto your Dremel. Put on eye and ear protection before you start cutting. Turn on your Dremel and set the power between 8 and 10. Make sure the metal you're cutting is affixed firmly in place. Gently touch the Dremel to the metal for a few seconds at a time until you see the metal being cut. You'll also see sparks fly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiber reinforced disks are more durable than ceramic disks, which can shatter when cutting metal.\n For grinding, attach grinding stones which can be fixed to the mandrel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use grinding stones, grinding wheels, chain saw sharpening stones, abrasive wheels and abrasive points to grind a material. Carbide bits tend to work best on metal, porcelain, or ceramic.\nUse cylindrical or triangular tips for round grinds. To grind a notch into something or grind an inside corner, use a flat disc shape. Or, use cylindrical or triangular tips for round grinds.\n Select a sandpaper bit and secure it in your Dremel. Sandpaper bits are available in fine through course grits, and all grades should fit on the same mandrel. Tighten the screw at the end of the sandpaper bit. Turn on your Dremel and set it between 2 and 10. Choose lower settings if you're sanding or polishing plastics or woods. Select a higher setting if you're sanding metal. While holding the material secure, run the bit across the material so that the sandpaper bit completely comes into contact with your material and sharpens or sands it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the sanding bits are in good shape so they don't scuff or mark your material. They should fit in the drill snugly and shouldn't be worn. Have several sanding bits on hand so you can quickly replace them.\nTo sand, you can use sanding bands, sanding discs, flap wheels, shaping wheels and finishing and detail abrasive brushes.\n If you've got a big job, begin with coarser bits before moving to softer bits. This can help you sand out larger scratches quickly and then you can have more control over working through the material. If you skip the coarse bit and begin with a softer bit, it will take you longer and you'll wear out the softer bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the bit every minute or two to see if the bit is worn or torn. Remember to turn off and unplug the Dremel while you do this.\n The Dremel is an excellent tool for fine-detail polishing or polishing in tight spots. Rub a polishing compound over the surface of your object and fit your Dremel with a felt polishing tip or wheel. Start your drill at a low speed (2) and run it against the polishing compound. You should work the wheel in circles until the material is polished. Avoid using a much higher speed (don't go over 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can polish without using a compound, but you'll get shinier results with it.\nFor cleaning and polishing jobs, use rubber polishing points, cloth or felt polishing wheels, and polishing brushes. Be sure to get the right kind of coarse polishing brush for the job. These bits are good for taking old paint off of metal furniture or cleaning up tools and grills.\n\n"}

Squares are easy \u2014 taking the square of a number is just multiplying it by itself. For instance, 3 squared is the same as 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 and 9 squared is the same as 9 \u00d7 9 = 81. Squares are written by marking a small \"2\" above and to the right of the number being squared \u2014 like this: 32, 92, 1002, and so on.\n\n\nTry squaring a few more numbers on your own to test this concept out. Remember, squaring a number is just multiplying it by itself. You can even do this for negative numbers. If you do, the answer will always be positive. For example, -82 = -8 \u00d7 -8 = 64.;\n, The square root symbol (\u221a, also called a \"radical\" symbol) means basically the \"opposite\" of the 2 symbol. When you see a radical, you want to ask yourself, \"what number can multiply by itself to give the number under the radical?\" For instance, if you see \u221a(9), you want to find the number that can be squared to make nine. In this case, the answer is three, because 32 = 9.\n\n\nAs another example, let's find the square root of 25 (\u221a(25)). This means we want to find the number that squares to make 25. Since 52 = 5 \u00d7 5 = 25, we can say that \u221a(25) = 5.\nYou can also think of this as \"undoing\" a square. For example, if we want to find \u221a(64), the square root of 64, let's start by thinking of 64 as 82. Since a square root symbol basically \"cancels out\" a square, we can say that \u221a(64) = \u221a(82) = 8.\n Up until now, the answers to our square root problems have been nice, round numbers. This isn't always the case \u2014 in fact, square root problems can sometimes have answers that are very long, inconvenient decimals. Numbers that have square roots that are whole numbers (in other words, numbers that aren't fractions or decimals) are called perfect squares. All of the examples listed above (9, 25, and 64) are perfect squares because when we take their square roots, we get whole numbers (3, 5, and 8).\n\n\nOn the other hand, numbers that don't give whole numbers when you take their square roots are called imperfect squares. When you take one of these numbers' square roots, you usually get a decimal or fraction. Sometimes, the decimals involved can be quite messy. For instance, \u221a(13) = 3.605551275464.\n As you've probably noticed, taking the square root of perfect squares can be quite easy! Because these problems are so simple, it's worth your time to memorize the square roots of the first dozen or so perfect squares. You'll come across these numbers a lot, so taking the time to learn them early can save you lots of time in the long run. The first 12 perfect squares are:\n\n\n12 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\n22 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n\n32 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n42 = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n\n52 = 5 \u00d7 5 = 25\n\n62 = 6 \u00d7 6 = 36\n\n72 = 7 \u00d7 7 = 49\n\n82 = 8 \u00d7 8 = 64\n\n92 = 9 \u00d7 9 = 81\n\n102 = 10 \u00d7 10 = 100\n\n112 = 11 \u00d7 11 = 121\n\n122 = 12 \u00d7 12 = 144\n\n\n, Finding the square roots of imperfect squares can sometimes be a bit of a pain \u2014 especially if you're not using a calculator (in the sections below, you'll find tricks for making this process easier). However, it's often possible to simplify the numbers in square roots to make them easier to work with. To do this, you simply need to separate the number under the radical into its factors, then take the square root of any factors that are perfect squares and write the answer outside the radical. This is easier than it sounds \u2014 read on for more information!Let's say that we want to find the square root of 900. At first glance, this looks very difficult! However, it's not hard if we separate 900 into its factors. Factors are the numbers that can multiply together to make another number. For instance, since you can make 6 by multiplying 1 \u00d7 6 and 2 \u00d7 3, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\nInstead of working with the number 900, which is somewhat awkward, let's instead write 900 as 9 \u00d7 100. Now, since 9, which is a perfect square, is separated from 100, we can take its square root on its own. \u221a(9 \u00d7 100) = \u221a(9) \u00d7 \u221a(100) = 3 \u00d7 \u221a(100). In other words, \u221a(900) = 3\u221a(100).\nWe can even simplify this two steps further by dividing 100 into the factors 25 and 4. \u221a(100) = \u221a(25 \u00d7 4) = \u221a(25) \u00d7 \u221a(4) = 5 \u00d7 2 = 10. So, we can say that \u221a(900) = 3(10) = 30.\n Think \u2014 what number times itself equals -16? It's not 4 or -4 \u2014 squaring either of these gives positive 16. Give up? In fact, there isn't a way to write the square root of -16 or any other negative number with ordinary numbers. In these cases, we have to substitute imaginary numbers (usually in the form of letters or symbols) to take the place of the negative number's square root. For example, the variable \"i\" is usually used for the square root of -1. As a general rule, the square root of a negative number will always be an imaginary number (or include one).\n\n\nNote that although imaginary numbers can't be represented with ordinary digits, they can still be treated like ordinary numbers in many ways. For instance, the square roots of negative numbers can be squared to give those negative numbers, just like any other square root. For example, i2 = -1\n\n\n, Though it can be a little time-consuming, it's possible to solve for the square roots of difficult imperfect squares without a calculator. To do this, we'll use a solving method (or algorithm) that's similar \u2014 but not exactly the same \u2014 as basic long division.Start by writing out your square root problem in the same from as a long division problem. For example, let's say that we want to find the square root of 6.45, which is definitely not a convenient perfect square. First, we'd write an ordinary radical symbol (\u221a), then we'd write our number underneath it. Next, we'd make a line above our number so that it's in a little \"box\" \u2014 just like in long division. When we're done, we should have a long-tailed \"\u221a\" symbol with 6.45 written under it.\nWe'll be writing numbers above our problem, so be sure to leave space.\n To start solving your problem, group the digits of the number under the radical sign into pairs, starting at the decimal point. You may want to make small marks (like dots, slashes, commas, etc.) between your pairs to keep track of them.\n\n\nIn our example, we would divide 6.45 into pairs like this: 6-.45-00. Note that there is a \"leftover\" digit on the left \u2014 this is OK.\n Start with the first number or pair on the left. Pick the biggest number with a square that is less than or equal to the \"group\". For instance, if the group was 37, you would pick 6, because 62 = 36 < 37 but 72 = 49 > 37. Write this number above the first group. This is the first digit of your answer.\n\n\nIn our example, the first group in 6-.45-00 is 6. The biggest number that is less than or equal to 6 when squared is 2 \u2014 22 = 4. Write a \"2\" above the 6 under the radical.\n Take the first digit of your answer (the number you just found) and double it. Write this underneath your first group and subtract to find the difference. Drop the next pair of numbers down beside the answer. Finally, write the last digit of the double of the first digit of your answer to the left and leave a space next to it.\n\n\nIn our example, we would start by taking the double of 2, the first digit of our answer. 2 \u00d7 2 = 4. Next, we would subtract 4 from 6 (our first \"group\"), getting 2 as our answer. Next, we would drop down the next group (45) to get 245. Finally, we would write 4 once more to the left, leaving a small space to add onto the end, like this: 4_.\n Next, you want to add a digit to the right side of the number you've written off to the left. Pick the digit that multiplies with your new number to be as large as possible, yet still less than or equal to the \"dropped down\" number. For example, if your \"dropped down\" number is 1700 and your number to the left is 40_, you would fill in the blank with \"4\" because 404 \u00d7 4 = 1616 < 1700, while 405 \u00d7 5 = 2025. The number you find in this step is the second digit of your answer, so you can add it above the radical sign.\n\n\nIn our example, we want to find the number to fill in the blank in 4_ \u00d7 _ that makes the answer as large as possible but still less than or equal to 245. In this case, the answer is 5. 45 \u00d7 5 = 225, while 46 \u00d7 6 = 276.\n Continue performing this modified long division pattern until you start getting zeroes when you subtract from your \"dropped-down\" number or you reach your desired level of accuracy. When you're done, the numbers you used to fill the blanks at each step (plus the very first number you used) make up the digits in your answer.\n\n\nContinuing from our example, we would subtract 225 from 245 to get 20. Next, we would drop down the next pair of digits, 00, to make 2000. Doubling the numbers above the radical sign, we get 25 \u00d7 2 = 50. Solving for the blank in 50_ \u00d7 _ =/< 2,000, we get 3. At this point, we have \"253\" above the radical sign \u2014 repeating this process once again, we get a 9 as our next digit.\n To finalize your answer, you need to put its decimal point in the right place. Luckily, this is easy \u2014 all you need to do is line it up with the decimal point in your original number. For example, if the number under the radical sign is 49.8, you would simply move the point up between the two numbers above the 9 and the 8.\n\n\nIn our example, the number under the radical sign is 6.45, so we would simply slide the point up and place it between the 2 and 5 digits of our answer, giving us 2.539.\n Once you've memorized your perfect squares, finding the square roots of imperfect squares becomes much easier. Since you already know a dozen or so perfect squares, any number that falls between two of these perfect squares can be found by \"whittling away\" at an estimate between these values. To start, find the two perfect squares your number is between. Next, determine which of these two numbers it is the closest to.\n\n\nFor example, let's say we need to find the square root of 40. Since we've memorized our perfect squares, we can say that 40 is in between 62 and 72, or 36 and 49. Since 40 is greater than 62, its square root will be greater than 6, and since it is less than 72, its square root will be less than 7. 40 is a little closer to 36 than it is to 49, so the answer will probably be a little closer to 6. In the next few steps, we'll narrow our answer down.\n Once you've picked out two perfect squares that your number is between, it's simply a matter of whittling away at your estimate until you reach an answer you're satisfied with \u2014 the farther you go, the more accurate your answer is. To start, pick a \"tenth place\" decimal point for your answer \u2014 it doesn't have to be correct, but you'll save time if you use common sense to pick one that's close to the right answer.\n\n\nIn our example problem, a reasonable estimate for the square root of 40 might be 6.4, since we know from above that the answer is probably a little closer to 6 than it is to 7.\n Next, square your estimate. Unless you're lucky, you probably won't get your original number \u2014 you'll either be a little higher than it or a little lower. If your answer is too high, try again with a slightly smaller estimate (and vice versa if it is too low).\n\n\nMultiply 6.4 by itself to get 6.4 \u00d7 6.4 = 40.96, which is slightly higher than original number.\nNext, since we over-shot our answer, we'll multiply the number one tenth less than our estimate above by itself and to get 6.3 \u00d7 6.3 = 39.69. This is slightly lower than our original number. This means that the square root of 40 is somewhere between 6.3 and 6.4. Additionally, since 39.69 is closer to 40 than 40.96, you know the square root will be closer to 6.3 than 6.4.\n At this point, if you're happy with your answers, you may want to simply use one of your first guesses as an estimate. However, if you'd like a more accurate answer, all you need to do is pick an estimate for your \"hundredths place\" that puts this estimate between your first two. Continuing with this pattern, you can get three decimal places for your answer, four, and so on \u2014 it just depends how far you want to go.\n\n\nIn our example, let's pick 6.33 for our two-decimal point estimate. Multiply 6.33 by itself to get 6.33 \u00d7 6.33 = 40.0689. Since this is slightly above our original number, we'll try a slightly lower number, like 6.32. 6.32 \u00d7 6.32 = 39.9424. This is slightly below our original number, so we know that the exact square root is between 6.33 and 6.32. If we wanted to continue, we would keep using this same approach to get an answer that's continually more and more accurate.\n\n"}

Maybe you start huffing and puffing because your breath has gotten faster. Maybe you feel your teeth clenching together, or maybe you notice your hands are balled up. Maybe you feel your face getting red. All of these signs are your body's way of telling you you're feeling angry.Some of the other physical signs of anger you may notice include clenching your jaws or grinding your teeth, headache, stomach ache, increased and rapid heart rate, sweating (especially your palms), feeling hot in the neck/face, shaking or trembling, and dizziness.\nKeep in mind that not everyone will show anger in the same way. You may feel some of these things, but you might also feel different things when you get angry.;\n, Some people, when they get mad, literally \"see red,\" meaning they notice more redness in their environment.\n\nOther people get a sort of tunnel vision, meaning they have trouble seeing right. Other people feel a tenseness in their bodies, or they may feel like something heavy is on their chest. All of these things could help you realize when you're angry., Some kids don't know how to talk about their anger. When that happens, they just bottle it up inside. That's not good because it can make you feel worse, both in your heart and your body. You may notice that you get headaches, for example, or have a stomachache., It is important to acknowledge how you are feeling and to put a label on it. When you're angry, the first person you need to tell is yourself. That is, you need to be able to admit to yourself what you're feeling. So you could say to yourself (out loud or in your head), \"I'm feeling mad.\"It can also help to figure out how angry you are. Think of it like a stoplight. Green is not angry at all. Yellow is getting angry, and red is angry. How angry are you?\n\n, Next, you need to figure out why you are upset. What has happened to make you so mad? You might need to take a few minutes to think about what has you upset, though sometimes you might know immediately.For example, you may be mad because your sister stole your favorite book, or you may be upset because your mom told you can't do something you want to do.\n Often, you may feel angry about a situation, and you don't know why. Sometimes, anger can come from feeling afraid or hurt. Instead of dealing with that emotion, which can be hard, you turn to anger, which may feel easier at the time.Try to see if you can find an underlying feeling. Are you really feeling mad at your best friend who said something mean, or are you feeling hurt?\n\n, The best thing to do when you're mad is to talk about it with the person you're made at or an adult. Taking with someone about how you are feeling can help to make you feel better and to try to find a solution to the problem. The key is to not say mean things or lash out. Instead, try to say why you're mad.For example, if your sister borrows something without asking, you may want to lash out at her. Instead, say what you're feeling, like \"It upsets me when you take things without asking. I like knowing where things are, and it frustrates me if I can't find something. Will you please ask the next time?\"\nTry not to blame the other person. For example, DON'T say, \"You're always taking my things. You're a bad sister.\"\nTo a parent, you could say, \"I feel frustrated that our trip to the zoo got cancelled.\"\n\n, Anger can make you want to throw things, hit people, and say mean things. But, doing those things won't make you feel any better, and it will make the people you're with feel worse. It's best to try to discuss your feelings calmly.Before you say something when you're angry, ask yourself, \"Is it nice? Do I really want to say it? What will happen if I say it?\"\nNever use violence to resolve your anger. Throwing things or trying to hit people doesn't solve anything.\nRemember that it is important to avoid acting on your anger and stay rational.\n You might have heard people say \"Count to 10 when you get angry.\" What they really mean is you need to take a moment to breathe and calm down. Counting to 10 gives you the moment you need to breathe. When you feel yourself getting angry, try counting slowly up to 10 in your head, breathing deeply in and out as you do.You don't actually have to count to 10. You can also just take a moment to breathe. Try breathing like Darth Vader does. You just want to take deep, heavy breaths. Take a big, slow breath in through your nose, and then slowly blow it out through your mouth. Keep doing it until you feel yourself calming down., Another way to calm down is to imagine yourself somewhere you like or would like to be. Just close your eyes, and pretend like you're there. Try to use all your senses. What do you see? Smell? Hear? Feel? Taste? Just pretending to be somewhere else can help you calm down.For example, you could pretend to be in your favorite movie, or you could imagine yourself in the last place your family went on vacation.\n Sometimes, when something is making you really mad, you just need to walk away from the problem. Of course, you shouldn't run away from your parents or teachers, but if you feel yourself getting mad at your brother or sister, for example, sometimes it's just best to leave the room instead of getting in a fight.If you are mad at your parents, you can say, \"I'm getting really mad, and I need to be alone for a minute.\"\n\n, Sometimes, a good way to let your anger out is to actually just spend some time yelling. However, you don't want to yell at anyone. It's best to use this one in the privacy of your bedroom. Just let the person know you need to go be angry for a minute.Go into your room, and try yelling \"Raw!\" or even just screaming into your pillow.\n Finding an activity that will take your focus away from what is making you angry is a good strategy. Do something that you enjoy, such as reading a book, calling up a friend, going to see a movie, playing a game, or going for a walk.\n\nExercise is an especially good way to distract yourself because the physical activity will help to get rid of the cortisol in your system. Go outside and do something, such as riding your bike, playing basketball with a friend, or even just walking or running around.\n\n"}

True, it might be easier for you because you don't have to deal with the pressure of her being there, but it's so much worse for her, because she doesn't know what to say after that. It's much more natural in person.Plus, there is more of a chance to get that \"no\" when she doesn't feel that you really mean it.\n If you cannot ask her out in person, then call her up. At least you're really talking, not using childish abbreviations and emoticons on Facebook. Tell her how you feel about her. Let her know that you'll always be there for her. Don't tell her you love her right away, because depending on how long you've known her, that's a little creepy. Be honest with her, and be yourself, and it will come naturally. Also, when asking a girl out and you don't have a lot of self confidence you just have to be a man and say \"Hey I like/love you and I really would like to get to know you better\" and if she says no, then just be like she couldn't handle all this awesomeness, because you are awesome and you should know it.\n (EX:a guy who hates doing whatever the girl is passionate about.)\n\n, she will probably say no, but if you lay it gently like,\"Hey (insert name here), I know we're just friends but will you go out with me?\" She may say no to even this, but don't be so discouraged, keep on trying, not too often though.\n\n"}

If the wall does not absorb a sprinkle of water, or if there's obvious surface contamination, wash the surface thoroughly. If the wall is coated in paint or sealer, or if it's too smooth to support stucco, try one of the following treatments:Acid etching\nSandblasting\nBush hammer or roughing machine (for unpainted, smooth surfaces)Applying a bonding agent, referring to specific product instructions. Do not use over water-soluble paint.If there is any doubt that the wall can support the stucco, follow the instructions in the stud wall section above, attaching metal lath and plastering over it.\n Wet the wall right before you apply the first coat of plaster, preferably with a fog spray. This improves the suction bond and reduces the amount of water the wall absorbs from the plaster, preventing premature drying. The surface should be damp, but not soaked.Delay the job if the next week of weather involves freezing temperature, hot weather (above 90\u00baF / 32\u00baC), or high wind. These conditions will interfere with the curing process.\n This coat should be 1 part cement material (including lime) and 2\u00bc to 4 parts sand.Plastic cement, which has been pre-mixed with lime, is usually the easiest to mix and work with. Combine this with plaster sand from a dry material yard.Only add enough water to allow you to trowel the plaster, or it may sag or fail to stick to the wall.\n Trowel on a layer \u00bc inch (6.4 mm) thick.Score this with shallow, horizontal lines using a notched trowel, keeping the tool perpendicular to the wall.These grooves will help the next coat bond onto the surface.\n\n\nAcid-etched surfaces (among others) may not be quite rough enough for a strong bond with this method. Instead, dash on the scratch coat using a cement gun, or by whipping it on with a fiber brush or whisk broom. This forces out air to create a stronger bond.Some builders combine the scratch coat and brown coat into one base coat. If you choose to do this, plan on a total stucco thickness of about \u215c\" (9.5 mm) for cast concrete, and \u00bd\" (12.7 mm) for unit masonry.Allow about \u00bc\" (6.4 mm) of this thickness for the finish coat., With modern cement on a rigid surface, there is no need to wait for the scratch coat to cure completely. For a stronger bond, trowel on the second, \"brown\" coat as soon as the scratch coat is rigid enough to resist cracking, usually after four or five hours.Rod and float this surface until it is level and \u00bc\" (6.4 mm) thick.The brown coat mix should contain 1 part cement materials and 3 to 5 parts sand.It may help to compact this layer with a shingle float.\n Over the next 48 hours, it is critical to keep the stucco moist. If the relative humidity of the air is below 70%, you will need to mist or fog the surface once or twice a day.Wait at least seven days for the brown coat to cure, wetting periodically if it begins to dry prematurely. Some organizations recommend 10 or even up to 21 days of drying for even more crack resistance.In extremely hot or windy conditions, put up a windbreak and sun shade. You may even need to cover the moistened surface with polyethylene.\n The decorative finish coat contains 1 part cement materials and 1\u00bd to 3 parts sand.Optionally, it may include pigment as well to add color.

Soft or uneven ground can affect how the vehicle sits, giving you a less reliable outcome.Blacktop or concrete are the preferred surfaces to conduct this test on.\nAn uneven surface will shift the weight of the vehicle, causing the suspension to respond differently than it would otherwise.\n The bounce test requires that you compress the suspension of the vehicle and assess how it recovers. In order to do so, place both of your palms on a stable part of the front of the vehicle (the hood will suffice) and press down with all of your weight. Take your hands away and watch the vehicle as it rises again.Press on the hood near the very front of the car to prevent putting a dent in it.\nIf you are unable to put enough pressure on the vehicle to compress the suspension, ask a friend to help.\n After releasing the vehicle, it should bounce back up and right itself in a single bounce.

Friends can insult each other unknowingly. When in doubt of whether they are friends or friendly enemies, you could just see if the one who hurt you is ready to apologize or looks not so happy after hurting you. If they seem perfectly at peace or if they do it again and again, you know you have a friendly enemy.;\n, Most bullies do not change their ways any sooner. If they get to a point where they enjoy hurting or maneuvering plans to trouble you, they would be very sure of what they are doing. This is to say that they may come back to you with more trouble. Do not share, talk or indulge in friendly conversations with them. The more you avoid them when you meet them, the better you will find to protect yourself.\n Unfriendly friends become so or behave badly because of some emotional or mental situation. There are some who do it for the fun of it. Either ways, it is best to remain civil and peaceable. As they are the friendly enemies and not you. You could be yourself and not get into revenge or bad mouthing them. This may put your character under scrutiny too.\n It goes without saying that the more they know that you do not want to be friends with them, the better the chances of them not getting back to you. Keep your distance and do not share any of your experiences or stories with them. Allow them to feel left out if they would. This is a classic way to have them realize that you do not need them. When you don't need them, they would not be under the impression that they could manipulate your feelings and hurt you.\n In order to hurt you they may try to involve themselves in your activities or try to voice their opinion in your matters. Do not entertain their views or accept help from them. Try to do your work on your own or with the help of those who are genuine with you. If you do not need friendly enemies, they may not have an opportunity to hurt you.\n Once they realize that they are not having any bad impact on you, they may feel discouraged and change, temporarily. They may not look at you as an easy victim to their jokes, pranks and insults. But if you allow them to get back in your life as friends, they may get back to being friendly enemies or unfriendly friends.\n Whatever they are jealous of, you keep improving it. Unfriendly friends should not affect you enough to get weak or lose trust in your strengths. The number of such friends are not certain. Hence, it may work well for you if you stay focused with your work and do not think about what they do, say and think about you.\n You could choose to be by yourself if you have no other friends. If you do have good friends with whom who have similarities or are supportive, you could appreciate them and work with them."}

It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \"bad\" cholesterol.

Within a day, you're less likely to get a heart attack. If you make it a year, your risk of heart disease gets cut in half. And in 15 years, it's like you never smoked. So, yes, you still have time.A person's risk of heart disease and heart attack greatly increases with the number of cigarettes he or she smokes.

Look for the Hard Disk on which your system is installed on and remember the disk number (disk 0, disk 1 and so on). Then, look at the disk's partitions which are listed from left to right, and remember the partition number which you want to be the active partition (the left most partition is number 1, and so on).;\n, Before you do that, make sure that you have installed Windows XP on the partition to be activated. If you set a new active partition and there is no Windows XP installed on that partition, the Windows XP boot loader will look for an operating system on the new active partition, but will fail to do so and your computer will not boot at all. In this example, I had already installed Windows XP on the partition to be activated. It's also possible to just copy your Windows XP installation from the old active partition to the new active partition, but not while that Windows XP installation is running.\n I cannot link to it here because wikiHow doesn't allow the download link for whatever reason, so just do a Google search for \"hxd\". You can download the portable edition which does not need to be installed. You can use any other hex editor you like, but it needs to be capable of opening system drives.\n You should have remembered the correct disk number from step 1 (note that HxD starts counting disks at 1 not 0 like the diskmgmt.msc).\n Let's go! What you see here is the first sector (sector 0) of your hard drive which contains the boot loader code, the master boot record and the partition table. Look for the last 5 lines of the first sector (sector 0). The sector ends with \"55 AA\". This is where the partition table is stored. It starts at offset 1BE and ends at 1FD. We need to change the \"bootable\" flag of our partitions. It can only have two states: \"80\" means bootable, and \"00\" means non-bootable. The bootable flags of the four primary partitions are located at offset 1BE, 1CE, 1DE and 1EE. Look at the image to the right where I highlighted the bootable flag of the four primary partitions. In my example, the first partition is bootable because the bootable flag says \"80\", while the second, third and fourth partitions are not bootable because their bootable flag says \"00\". So you may have already guessed what to do now, overwrite the old bootable flag with \"00\" and change the new partition's bootable flag to \"80\". Do not set two partitions as bootable, this is not allowed and may lead to a non-booting system. Only one of the four partitions may have the bootable flag set. DO NOT reboot your computer yet, you have to finish the next step first!\n\n, Now there's one important thing left. When your computer boots and runs the Windows XP boot loader, it will look for the Windows XP startup bootstrap files. If these files are missing on your new active partition, your system won't boot. If you have installed Windows XP on different partitions on the same hard drive, the startup bootstrap files might only be present on the current active partition. So you'll have to copy these files from your old active partition to the new active partition. Have a look at the image to the right, where the needed files are highlighted (8 files). Do not include pagefile.sys, this is NOT needed. Copy these 8 files to your new active partition. In my example, I copied the 8 files from C: to D:. Again, important note: Windows XP has to be installed on your new active partition in order for this to work. If it's not, your system will not boot.\n"}

Does it make you feel claustrophobic? Do you stress over lack of control? Are you fine until the plane hits turbulence? Is the anticipation of the flight worse than the flight itself? Once you acknowledge the cause of your travel jitters you can begin finding methods to help prevent it. , Once you book your flight, begin learning calming breathing techniques. The more you\u2019re able to practice these exercises, the easier they will be to use when travel jitters strike. A good exercise for beginners is abdominal breathing. Practice for ten minutes every day, a good time is right when you wake up and your mind is still calm. For added benefit, whenever you encounter a stressful experience, an important work meeting or a 3-hour pot roast burns, practice the breathing exercise. This will give you the opportunity to feel the helpful benefits before the pressure of flying! Place one hand on your belly and one on your chest.\nBreath in through your nose, expanding your diaphragm, for a count of five. (Your chest should not rise during your breath.)\nBreath out through our mouth for a count of five. Focus on pushing all the air out of your lungs.\nRepeat 6-10 times.\n Travel jitters generally come from a mental, rather than a physical fear. Meditation focuses on overcoming those fears or anxieties. Through meditation you can learn to recognize and move past those anxieties. There are multiple forms of mediation but two that may be most beneficial to overcome travel jitters are mindfulness and visualization. Both are best practiced through finding a class or downloading a class from the internet. Mindfulness. Practicing mindfulness is about learning to live in the present moment. It does not banish travel jitters, but rather helps you acknowledge and move past these feelings.\nVisualization. Often, when you find yourself in a situation that causes panic, it can be helpful to visualize yourself in a different location. So when you sit down on the plane and begin to feel anxious, visualization can help you escape the immediate fear by placing your mind in a safer \u201chappy place.\u201d\n\n, Once you\u2019ve packed, go back through everything and double check that you have all the necessities. You don\u2019t want to be on your way to the airport and realize you forgot your wallet! The length and location of your trip will affect your list, but here are a few necessities to help get you started. Once you\u2019ve ensured you have everything you need, set it together by the door so you will not forget it when you leave the next day.\n\n\npurse/wallet\nphone charger\npassport and foreign currency (if traveling out of the country)\nappropriate clothes and shoes for your destination\nmedications\nticket (if possible do an early, online check-in to avoid standing in an extra line the day of)\n\n, Look up the travel time and have a plan to stay distracted during the flight. Reading a book, doing puzzles, or watching a movie are all great ways to stay busy. Make sure you consider time during take-off and landing (often some of the most stressful moments in flight) when you can\u2019t use electronics! , If you have an early flight, allow yourself plenty of time to get up, organized, and to the airport. If your flight isn\u2019t until later in the day, set an alarm to remind yourself when it is time to leave. Remember, for most domestic flights you should try to arrive at least 60 minutes, if you\u2019re not checking baggage, and 90 minutes, if you are. For international flights you should arrive at least 2 hours early. If you are driving yourself, add an extra 30 minutes to your travel time, as parking is often a shuttle-ride away from the airport.\n Is a friend driving you? Send a text to confirm the time. Taking a cab? Call and order one the night before. Driving yourself? Make sure your car has enough gas.\n Drink a cup of tea, make your bed, or do some simple stretches. Whatever your normal routine, the more you\u2019re able to stick to it on travel day the less stressful the day will seem. Just try your best to avoid extra caffeine as it increases feelings of anxiety.\n About 10 minutes before your boarding time try to use the restroom. After you get on the plane there will likely be at least 30 minutes before the plane is in the air and you\u2019re free to walk around the cabin. Additionally, if your anxiety over travelling stems from a fear of enclosed places, not having to use the small aircraft restroom will take an extra stress off your mind.\n Mention your anxiety to the flight attendant or have a conversation with the person seated next to you. Don\u2019t let the conversation spiral into a discussion about all the terrors of flying, but just having someone that knows how you\u2019re feeling can be enough to keep travel jitters away. Remember 25 percent of people have some fear of flying and talking to those around you on the flight can help create a support group to help you through the flight. , Now is the perfect time to use the breathing and meditation techniques you\u2019ve been working on! Remember deep abdominal breathing and whichever meditation technique you have been studying. Focus yourself as soon as you get on the plane and then at any point when you begin to feel jittery. Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed. The best way to deal with travel jitters is to keep them from happening!\n\n, After you get settled on the plane get out a book and start reading. Find an interesting book before your flight, something by an author you know you enjoy. Begin the book a few days before the flight, stopping a few chapters in, preferably at a cliffhanger or plot twist. Then when you start reading during the flight you\u2019re already into the story and more likely to keep your attention. , New regulations allow you to use small electronics during take-off and landing. Once the plane starts taxiing to the runway, take out your smartphone, iPod, or small tablet. Before flying download a new album from your favorite artist or put together a playlist of your favorite songs and listen to it during takeoff. Having headphones in will block out any noise from the plane during takeoff and help you feel more relaxed.\n Once the flight gets going you\u2019re able to take out your laptop. An engrossing two hour movie is a great way to use the majority of your flight time. If possible, pick a movie you\u2019ve never seen before that has been on your \u201cmust watch\u201d list for a while, or chose one of your favorites that you know will make you laugh.\n The most important thing to remember during the flight is to keep yourself distracted. Go back to your book, listen to more music, play a game, meditate, or watch a TV show. Find whatever is best at keeping your attention and mind off of the flight stick with it!\n\n"}

If you see a lot of red doors, consider this color for your own front door.\nIf you want to stand out just a little, pick something that fits with the color scheme but is unique. If most red doors tend to be very bright, go for a shade like burgundy.\n You do not have to match strictly with the color of your paint or siding. Look for subtle exterior colors found outside your home. For example, maybe the porch rails are painted yellow. You could make a yellow door to match to draw everything together. You could also look at the trim near your home. Pair a blue door with a blue trim."}

If, while researching a charity, you find key information is unavailable, you may be dealing with a fraudulent charity.Charities should be upfront about basic contact information, such as addresses and phone numbers.\nReputable charities are honest about where the money goes. You should be able to find detailed information on a charity's website regarding how donations are used and what percentages of donations go towards the actual cause.\nA charity that is not upfront about such information is more likely to be fraudulent.\n Most charities will work hard to make their case for a donation. This is how charities continue to sustain themselves. However, if a representative is very pushy or rude, even after you've declined a donation, you're likely dealing with a charity scam.It's normal for a charity representative to politely make the case for a donation. They may calmly repeat the benefits of their charity and ask you to reconsider.\nA scammer, however, will use more aggressive tactics. They may become somewhat hostile and attempt to guilt trip you into donating, asking questions like, \"Don't you care about this cause?\" A scammer will not politely restate their case. They will aggressively attempt to coerce you into donating after you've declined or requested more information.\n A legitimate charity should be able to easily provide you with paperwork that allows you to claim a tax deduction for a donation. If a charity is unable or unwilling to provide this paperwork, it's likely a scam. Do not work with charities that cannot provide such paperwork., A reputable charity would not conduct a sweepstakes for donations. Real charities put the bulk of their money towards their cause and organization. If a charity claims you're eligible to win a prize or sum of a money in a sweepstakes as a reward for donating, you're likely dealing with a fraudulent charity., Reputable charities track donations carefully and want to make sure there is no risk of the money getting lost or stolen. They will rarely request cash donations and certainly will not demand cash only donations. A charity that requires cash only donations is likely fraudulent, as they're trying to prevent donations from being easily traced. The money is likely not being used for charitable reasons., Unfortunately, it is impossible for a charity to direct 100% of donations towards its cause. All charities have administrative, operating, and marketing costs to consider. A charity that claims 100% of funds are put towards a cause is likely fraudulent.In general, charities have to spend at least 65% of donations on their cause. Stick to donating to charities who claim a percentage of donations in this range goes towards their cause.\n There are often news stories circulating about fake or fraudulent charities. Pay attention to any stories on the news regarding new charity frauds. If you are contacted by a charity that sounds similar to a recent fraud charity, be very suspicious. Research this charity extensively before agreeing to give money.\n\n"}

Density is a measurement of how much mass fits in a given volume for any substance. Materials that we consider \"heavy\" have a high density, while \"light\" materials have a low density.\n\nDensity tables exist online or in many text books for a wide range of substances. You can find a table of density values by searching for \u201cdensity table,\u201d \u201cliquid density table,\u201d or \u201csolid density table.\u201d\n\nThe density of pure water is set at 1000 kg per cubic meter. This is the same as 1000 mg/ml.\n\nFor comparison, some other common liquids have the following densities:Alcohol = 800 kg/m3=800 mg/ml\n\nGasoline = 737 kg/m3=737 mg/ml\n\nMilk = 1050 kg/m3=1050 mg/ml\n\nMercury = 13590 kg/m3=13590 mg/ml\n\n\n;\n, If you are trying to convert amounts for a prescription, you should check with your pharmacist. A pharmacist is in the best position to provide you with the correct density of whatever compound you need to measure.\n\nYou may find the density of your substance printed on the bottle. You might check that before contacting the pharmacist.\n Recall that density is equal to an item\u2019s mass divided by its volume.Rearranging this formula,\n\n\nVolume=massdensity{\\displaystyle {\\text{Volume}}={\\frac {\\text{mass}}{\\text{density}}}}.\n When you know the density of the material and the measurement of the sample you wish to convert, perform the division to convert from mass to volume of your substance.For example, suppose you wish to convert 20,000 milligrams each of water, alcohol, gasoline, milk and mercury into milliliters. 20,000 milligrams is equal to 20 grams, which is about the weight of 20 paper clips.The conversions for these five liquids are as follows:\n\nWater: (20,000\u00a0mg)/(1000\u00a0mg/ml)=20\u00a0ml water{\\displaystyle (20,000{\\text{ mg}})/(1000{\\text{ mg/ml}})=20{\\text{ ml water}}}\n\nAlcohol: (20,000\u00a0mg)/(800\u00a0mg/ml)=25\u00a0ml alcohol{\\displaystyle (20,000{\\text{ mg}})/(800{\\text{ mg/ml}})=25{\\text{ ml alcohol}}}\n\nGasoline: (20,000\u00a0mg)/(737\u00a0mg/ml)=27.137\u00a0ml gasoline{\\displaystyle (20,000{\\text{ mg}})/(737{\\text{ mg/ml}})=27.137{\\text{ ml gasoline}}}\n\nMilk: (20,000\u00a0mg)/(1050\u00a0mg/ml)=19.048\u00a0ml milk{\\displaystyle (20,000{\\text{ mg}})/(1050{\\text{ mg/ml}})=19.048{\\text{ ml milk}}}\n\nMercury: (20,000\u00a0mg)/(13590\u00a0mg/ml)=1.4717\u00a0ml mercury{\\displaystyle (20,000{\\text{ mg}})/(13590{\\text{ mg/ml}})=1.4717{\\text{ ml mercury}}}\n\n\n\n\n, Because milliliters and teaspoons are both measurements of volume, the density of the different materials no longer makes a difference. Converting from milliliters to teaspoons is fairly easy because the conversion factor is just 5 to 1. That is, 5 ml = 1 tsp.\n\nIf you know a measurement in milliliters, you can convert to teaspoons by just dividing by 5.\n Using the five samples from above, prepare for the conversion to teaspoons.\n\nWater: 20,000 mg = 20 ml/5 = 4 teaspoons\n\nAlcohol: 20,000 mg = 25 ml/5 = 5 teaspoons\n\nGasoline: 20,000 mg = 27.137 ml/5 = 5.4274 teaspoons\n\nMilk: 20,000 mg = 19.048 ml/5 = 3.8096 teaspoons\n\nMercury: 20,000 mg = 1.4717 ml/5 = 0.29434 teaspoons\n\n\n, Pure water is set as the standard for conversion density, with a density of 1.0 grams per milliliter. The densities of all other substances are set in relation to the density of water. Notice that mercury, with an extremely high density, converts to only about a quarter teaspoon for the same mass of water that equals one teaspoon.\n"}

Your bird's immunity levels lower when soaked with water, making them more prone to illnesses such as a cold, and they could also accidentally inhale the water. Soaps and shampoos can also irritate and dry out your quail's skin and get rid of the important oils on their feathers.\n\n\nThis is why you shouldn't randomly decide your quail needs a bath when they actually don't. If your quail seems smelly to you, there's usually nothing to be concerned about and it's a poor reason to bathe your bird.\n Is it dirt or gum?

You can choose to enlarge this pen, or change the specifications to fit your needs. This will be an enclosure that will comfortably house three or four small to medium size turtles. Use pressure treated wood since it will last longer. You should not use wood that has been treated with arsenic. Timber that is treated with ACQ (Ammoniacal Copper Quat) is good, while CCA (Chromated Copper Arsenate) should be avoided. You can find what the wood has been treated with on a tag that should be stapled to each piece of timber.For this portion of the project, you will need:\n\n\n8-foot-long landscaping timbers\n8-foot-long two-by-fours\n3-foot-tall stakes.\n2-foot-long two-by-two lumber\nA box of nails for wood\nHammer\nMeasuring tape\nShovel\n8 foot by 8 foot section of wire mesh\n\n, Clear any debris out of the area so you have a clean space to work. Use a measuring tape and some wooden stakes to mark out the area. This will be a square shaped pen.\n You need to dig a trench so you can put the walls down into the ground. Turtles are skilled diggers and can easily escape the enclosure if the walls are not deep enough., With your trench dug, you will place one 8-foot-long landscaping timber into the each eight-foot long ditch. This will create a square shape, and the first part of your support wall. You will use the 2-foot-long two-by-two pieces of lumber to attach the walls at the corners.\n\n\nUse the hammer to nail each corner together. The four corners should meet and be secure.\n Now that you have the corner supports attached, they will be significantly taller than the 8-foot-long landscaping timbers which are only a few inches tall when they are laid in the trenches. Using the 8-foot-long two-by-fours you will add height to the walls by nailing a two-by-four along each side to the two-by-two stakes. This will stack the timbers on top of each other and give height to the wall.\n\n\nYou can make the wall as tall as you\u2019d like. The minimum height should be twice as high as the adult length of a turtle. So if you have turtles that reach 10\u201d once they are mature, your wall should be at least 20\u201d high. This ensures that your turtles can\u2019t crawl over the walls and escape.\nTurtles don\u2019t fully grasp the concept of walls and when they are able to see out of the enclosure, like through wire mesh, they may spend their time pushing against the barrier, hoping to escape. A wooden barrier, at least as tall as the turtle\u2019s height, prevents this problem., An outdoor enclosure needs to let sunlight in but not any predators hoping to grab your turtle. Wire mesh is a good barrier since it allows sunlight and rain to fall through while still offering protection.nail the wire mesh directly to the top of the enclosure, but be sure to leave a corner accessible so you can put food and water into the enclosure.\n\n\nYou can also build a removable top to the enclosure, but this will take more time and additional materials.\n\n"}

For instance, you could say: \u201cI\u2019m planning to study for this exam by re-reading the assigned chapters and making flashcards with the vocabulary. Does that sound like a good plan to you? Would you suggest anything else?\u201d\n\n, Just as your teachers try to encourage you, you can encourage your teacher to provide interesting, relevant lectures and assignments. This is a long-term approach, but it can pay dividends in your learning as well as in making the class more bearable.But always be sincere: faking enthusiasm will only make the relationship worse.\n\n\nAsk questions that show that you\u2019re doing the reading and engaging with the material. Burnt-out teachers may become more engaged and lively if they see that their students are genuinely interested.\nDon\u2019t only talk to your teacher to ask for extensions on deadlines or other favors.\nThank her for a particularly clear explanation or an assignment that really helped you to learn.\n It\u2019s easy to get caught up in passing judgment and developing theories about people you don\u2019t like. But difficult people usually have some hidden reasons for their unreasonable behavior.Remember that you don\u2019t need to be friends with your teacher. Keep your focus on how to succeed as well as possible in the class.\n\n"}

If you want to keep brown sugar soft, you're best option is to store your brown sugar in a sealable, airtight container as soon as you open it up.Limit air exposure as much as possible when storing brown sugar. Choose a smaller container and pack the brown sugar to the top. Make sure to seal tightly, double checking for cracks and openings.You may not find a small enough container. In this case, use a small Ziplock bag. Squeeze out all the excess air before sealing the bag.;\n, Kitchen shops and some grocery stores sell what are called terra cotta sugar savers. These are small, circular devices made from terra cotta clay. They are inexpensive, about $3 each, and can be easily used to soften brown sugar. They are designed to release moisture into your sugar, keeping it soft in storage.\n\n\nAfter purchasing the terra cotta sugar saver, soak it in water for 15 minutes. Then, dry off the disk.Store the sugar saver with the brown sugar. Ideally, you should be using the terra cotta sugar saver alongside a sealable airtight container or plastic bag.If you add a sugar saver to a bag of brown sugar that's already hardened, it may take up to 8 hours for the sugar to soften., If you don't have a sugar saver, marshmallows work for some when it comes to keeping sugar soft. Throw a few marshmallows into your sugar container and see if it helps., Apples and bread are both fairly moist by nature. Adding a few slices of apples or a piece of bread to a bag of brown sugar can help keep it soft. The idea is the sugar will draw moisture from the bread or fruit. If you're adding apples or bread to hardened brown sugar, it may take a day before it begins to soften."}

The squidger is a larger piece of round, thicker plastic that you use to propel smaller discs into the pot. Winks come in yellow, red, green, and blue. There are 6 winks of each color.\nThe pot is the container that you try to put the winks into. The mat is basically the playing field. It\u2019s usually 6 feet by 3 feet. Place the mat on a flat surface in order to play. The mat has lines etched on both ends. This indicates the field\u2019s boundaries and baselines. The mat is usually made of felt.;\n, The goal of Tiddlywinks is to propel as many winks into the pot as you can.\n\n\nYou can either play Tiddlywinks in two-person teams or against another player. It\u2019s also possible to play the game with three people. Only 2 to 4 people can play Tiddlywinks.\nThe verb \u201cto squidge\u201d means you propel or flick the smaller plastic discs toward (and hopefully into) the pot using the squidger.\nThe way you squidge a wink is by putting your squidger on a wink. Apply pressure to it, and it should pop the wink forward. It can be difficult to squidge a wink when someone else\u2019s wink is on it. The wink below another wink is said to be \u201csquopped.\u201d You must only touch the top wink in your color sequence. If all the winks are squopped, the game is over.\n Some people sandpaper their squidger down. This will make it so they have less sharp edges.\n\n\nSome people use different size squidgers for different shots. Squidgers must be round and between 25 mm and 51 mm across and no thicker than 5 mm.\nThey cannot damage the winks. You may only use one per play. However, you can use different squidgers throughout the course of a game.\n Partners use blue and red winks or they use green and yellow winks. Once you have a partner, you should stand diagonally across from your partner on the mat\u2019s opposite corners. Blue winks are put in the corner diagonally positioned across from red; the same is true of green and yellow.If you\u2019re playing in a team, each player should take one of the two colors of the pairs above. Team play in Tiddlywinks is called \u201cpairs.\u201d\nIf you just playing against another person, one player will use blue and red winks and the other green and yellow winks. This is called \u201csingles.\u201dIt\u2019s possible to play with three people. In that instance, one of the people controls both colors and the other two each control one other color.\n This means that you see whose winks get closest to the pot or into it. If yours makes it into the pot or is closest, you get to start.\n\n\nPlace the pot in the middle of the mat. Place the winks behind the baselines. Each corner of the mat should contain winks of only one color. Arrange the colors clockwise in alphabetical order from the English language (blue first, and then green, etc.) Tiddlywinks turns then move in clockwise rotation after the squidge-off.\nPlay a wink of each color from behind the baseline in the direction of the pot. You always want to make sure you stay behind the baseline when you play a wink. The wink in or closest to the pot is the winner. Then, put the winks back behind the baseline.\n Generally, games of Tiddlywinks last 20 minutes for single matches and 24 minutes for pairs. Start the clock after the squidge-off.\n\n\nThe game can end before the time runs out, though, if someone squidges all the winks of their color into the pot. Games with three players usually run 22.5 minutes.\nYou can also choose to play until all winks are potted. There is usually a round limit period after the ending of the time period if all the winks are not potted. That means you continue playing until the turn of the color that won the squidge off. Five further rounds of the color are played, with each ending after the turn of the color that won the squidge-off.\n Start with the color that won the squidge-off. The colors take turns in alphabetical order of the English language. Use the squidger to propel the winks toward the pot when it is your turn.\n\n\nIf you get the wink inside the pot, that is called a potted wink. If the wink stops on all or part of another wink, the top wink is the squopping wink and the lower wink is the squopped wink.\nWinks that are not potted or squopped are called free winks. When it is your turn in the clockwise rotation, see how close you can flip one of your color\u2019s Tiddlywinks toward the pot. Be careful. If you send it off the mat, you lose your turn. If you get your color in the pot, you get another shot.\nIf a person\u2019s shot causes a wink of the same color to go off the mat, the next shot with that color is forfeited.\n Potting out means you empty out the pot to see how many winks are inside of it. You \u201cpot out\u201d if all of your winks are in the pot.\n\n\nIf all six winks of a single color are potted, that color is \u201cpotted out.\u201d The person controlling that color then wins the game. If you pot out, you also get an extra point and your opponents score one less point.\nIf all of the colors are not potted when the time runs out, add up the score for each color. Every potted wink is three points. Every uncovered wink is one point. Squopped and unplayed winks don\u2019t count. So, for example, if blue has 3 potted winks and 2 free, the score is 11. If yellow has 4 winks in a pot and 1 free, the total is 13.\nThe top scorer gets 4 points, the second scorer gets 2 and the third gets 1 point.\n Tiddlywinks is not just blind luck when it\u2019s played well. Some people will squop another person\u2019s Tiddlywinks in order to stop another person who has potted colors.\n\n\nFor example, if a player has five of his color in the pot but the sixth is squopped, he or she can\u2019t do anything until his or her partner frees it up.\nThere are many possible game plans, but a standard strategy is to try to build an area of friendly winks close to the pot, and to squop as many enemy winks as possible. Trying to put winks in the pot too early may end in disaster as your remaining playable winks become captured.\nHold the squidger with a firm but relaxed grip. Hold it high up so your fingers don\u2019t get in the way of the flick. Place the edge of the squidger on the middle of the wink, about 45 degrees to it., You cannot play a squopped wink. This means that a wink is covered even a tiny bit by another wink. You can, however, play the top wink of any pile if it is yours and follow through to any wink directly under it.If someone pots out, the time limit no longer matters. The game continues until all winks of a partnership are in the pot. All squops must be squidged. Covering winks are moved to 2mm away from all other winks. Play continues in the regular order. First color to pot out wins.\nTo play a squopped wink, you first play the upper surface of the unsquopped wink. Winks vertically below the wink you first touch can be hit by the squidger. The shot has to be short and continuous from start to finish. You could play a pile shot in which you send the enemy wink far away. This is called a boondock.\n\n"}

You can perform a colonic, also known as colon hydrotherapy. This is done using a small tube inserted into the rectum, through which warm water is gently pumped. You can also take an oral solution to increase excrement output, which are essentially homemade laxatives.Doing water or salt water enemas at home without a professional assistance is not recommended unless instructed to do so by a doctor.Most mainstream physicians do not recommend regular colonics for healthy individuals, though some natural doctors and other healthcare professionals recommend colon cleansing once or twice a year to help release toxins.;\n, Colon cleanses can be very helpful, but can also become harmful over time. Even natural, homemade colon cleansers can be hurtful to you. Just because something is natural doesn\u2019t mean it is harmless and a serious problem can occur if you begins to depend on colon cleansers rather than your healthy, natural colon function.\n\n\nThis dependence is called laxative abuse and can be an addiction much like any other.\nLaxative abuse can result in damage to the kidneys and the cardiovascular system and can be life-threatening.Never use a cleanse more than every six months unless under the care of a health professional.\n Once you do a colon cleanse, you need to put back in certain nutrients, called prebiotics and probiotics, into your body. Be prepared to restock and support your colon bacteria by eating foods that contain good bacteria for at least one to two months after you cleanse. These foods include:\n\n\nBananas\nGarlic\nLeeks\nWheat bran\nAsparagusSauerkraut\nKefir\nYogurt\nKimchee\nAged cheeses, Talk to your doctor before you try any colon cleanse. Discuss the type of cleanse you plan on doing to be certain it isn't going to hurt you. Certain herbs, fruits, and vegetables can interact with prescription medications, so be aware of the side effects of your medications.\n\n\nAs a general rule, anyone with a condition that affects the digestive tract, the kidneys, the liver, or the cardiovascular system should be very cautious about using a colon cleanse and should always talk to their doctor before using a cleanse.\nIf you have more than three to four bowel movements in a day, discontinue all cleanses and call your doctor for advice.\n For natural, food based cleanses, you need to pick the right foods. Vegetables contain fiber that is essential for healthy and frequent bowel movements. Pick the freshest fruit you can, and try to buy organic is possible. You want to be ingesting as many nutrients as possible with no additives. Make sure all vegetables and fruits are raw when you use them in the cleanse. Good produce to include is:\n\n\nSpinach\nAsparagus\nBrussels sprouts\nCabbage\nCelery\nCollard greens\nLeeks\nPeas\nSwiss chard\nMustard greens\nDark green lettuces\nWheatgrass\nKale\nBok choy\nParsley\nCilantro\nCucumber\nBeets and beet greens, The best ways to use fresh produce for a colon cleanse is to use a juicer or to make them as smoothies in a blender. The juices will kick start your colon and also give you added energy, and the edible skins give you added fiber. You can also add organic apple juice as needed to the juice to make it thin enough to drink easily. Apple juice contains pectin, a kind of fiber which is very helpful in achieving complete bowel movement.\n\n\nYou can mix and match vegetables to your own taste, but you should add enough to have three eight ounce glasses every day for five to seven days.\nAdd some fruit to improve the taste. Use bananas, oranges, cherries, berries, plums, or apples. If you leave the edible skins on the fruit, it will give you an added boost of fiber. , If you aren't sure what kind of recipe to start with, try a green cleanse recipe. Chop two apples, four stalks of celery without the leaves, one cucumber, six kale leaves and add it to a blender or juicer. Add one tablespoon of finely chopped fresh ginger root and lemon juice. Blend or juice and enjoy. If this mixture is too bitter, try adding one teaspoon of honey to sweeten it.\n If you don't like straight greens, try a recipe with more fruit. Mix two peeled oranges, one quartered and cored apple, two tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 cup of spinach, and one kale leaf in a juicer or blender. Once smooth or juiced, drink and enjoy.\n\n\nYou can add a little apple juice if this mixture isn't thin enough for you.\nYou can also add some baby carrots for some extra color, fiber, and sweetness.\n For a more nutrient packed cleanse, try an aloe vera juice based cleanse. Add together one cup aloe vera juice, \u00bd cup of rolled oats, one cup spinach, two kale leaves, five Swiss chard leaves, one peeled banana, \u00bd a medium cucumber, \u00bd cup of blueberries, and one teaspoon of cinnamon. You can either put it through a juicer or mix it in a blender. Once smooth or juiced, drink and enjoy.You can add some honey if it isn't sweet enough.\n One popular cleanse for colon health is a psyllium and bentonite clay cleanse. Bentonite clay is a mixture of mineral salts, which includes calcium bentonite and sodium bentonite. This clay absorbs many times its weight in water as well as minerals, toxins, and organic substances. This ability makes bentonite clay useful in cleanses. It is commonly used by natural health professionals and has found a place in mainstream medicine to safely treat various types of poisonings and overdoses.Bentonite clay and psyllium husks, a naturally derived fiber-heavy powder, can be purchased online or at your local health food store.\n Be careful how much of the bentonite clay you use. An overabundance of this product can cause electrolyte, or mineral, imbalances. This can cause some serious health issues, which is counterproductive to the goal of a cleanse. Make sure to talk to your doctor before your try this cleanse. It is not recommended for everyone, so always follow your doctor's advice. He or she knows your situation and how this product can effect you better than anyone.\n\n\nAlso, always follow the directions on the products you buy., To make this cleanse, add one rounded teaspoon psyllium husk, which can be dark yellow or brown husks, to one teaspoon of bentonite clay powder to an empty glass. Add eight ounces water or pure, organic apple juice to the glass, stirring briskly to dissolve the powder. Drink it quickly before it has time to thicken.\n\n\nThis should immediately be followed by another eight ounces of water or apple juice.\nYou can also get bentonite clay in liquid form., The Master Cleanse is great for cleansing, but it has also been used as a weight loss method. It has been in use since 1940, but it does have some known adverse effects, such as vitamin deficiencies, blood sugar changes, muscle breakdown, and frequent bowel movements.\n\n\nAlways consult a physician before doing the Master Cleanse. You should not do a Master Cleanse for longer than four to five days.\nIf you are pregnant, nursing, under 16 or over 50, or have chronic heart, kidney, liver or digestive conditions, you should not use the Master Cleanse., The traditional Master Cleanse has a set recipe. Start by freshly squeezing the juice of one lemon into a cup, which should be about two tablespoons. Next, add two tablespoons of pure, organic maple syrup. To this, add a pinch of cayenne pepper, which is about 1/10 of a teaspoon. Pour 10 ounces of purified water on top and stir vigorously. Once it settles, drink the whole glass.\n\n\nDrink a minimum of six to 12 glasses throughout the day whenever you are hungry or feel you need a colon cleanse. , In addition to these other cleanses, you can try tea cleanses before bed. Try teas with laxative-like qualities, such as herbal detox teas or senna tea. Herbal detox teas contain ingredients that will help cleanse your system and energize your as well. Senna has been used as medicine in Arabic and European countries since 800 BCE, mainly as a laxative. You can buy these at your local heath food stores.\n\n\nTo make herbal detox tea, boil a tablespoon of the loose leaf tea, or the tea bag, in eight ounces of water for 15 minutes. Let cool, strain, and drink.\nTo make senna tea, take one teaspoon of dried senna or three tablespoons of fresh senna leaves. Add the leaves to eight ounces of boiled water. Steep for five to 10 minutes, strain, and drink."}

{"title": "How to Graph1", "summary": "take your data and analyze your variables.\nplot each point.\nplot all your points and draw a line of best fit.this is a smooth line or curve that follows the dots as best as possible without making sharp corners.\nfigure out the slope of the line.\nfind the y-intercept.", "article": " Your variables are the two things that have been measured. You need to determine which axis you want each variable to lie; the general rule is that the independent variable, or the factor you control lies on the x-axis, whereas whatever you measure in relation to that is the dependent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you are measuring how changing the amount of water fed to a sunflower plant affects growth, you would control how much water you give each sunflower plant and measure each plant\u2019s growth after a fixed amount of time. Because the amount of water is controlled, the amount of water given each day would be recorded on the x-axis. It is understood that you expect plant growth to be dependent on how much water you give; therefore, it is dependent on the independent variable, and would be recorded on the y-axis.;\n, Each data point has two numbers: the x-value and the y-value. These come in pairs and create a link between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if a plant that is watered 2 cups of water a day grows 6 inches (15.2\u00a0cm) in three weeks, its x-value is 2 (because it represents the variable that is controlled: water) and its y-value is 6 (because that is the variable that is measured: plant growth).\n This line does not necessarily have to go right through each point as long as it the curve is as smooth as possible and runs very close to as many points as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line represents the relationship between your two variables. For example, in the case of watering plants, giving too little water will completely dry out your plant and keep it from growing, but giving too much water will drown the plant and make it rot. Therefore, growth is very low for very low or very high quantities of water, and highest when the quantity of water is somewhere in between. The amount of water that causes the most growth is the highest point on the line\n\n, The slope is how much the y-value increases when the x-value increases by 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a straight line, the slope is constant. This is because the line does not ever get any steeper or flatter. As x increases, y increases by a constant amount, creating a straight line.\nOn a flat, horizontal line, the slope is 0. This is because no matter how x changes, the change in y is always zero.\nOn a vertical line, the slope is undefined. This is because you can\u2019t measure how y changes with x because x never changes.\nOn a curved line, the slope is not constant. This is because the line changes in steepness as you go across; one unit of change in the x-axis does not always create the same change in the y-axis.\nOn a line with equation y=mx+b, the slope is m. This is because when x changes, y increases or decreases by the m multiplied by however much x changes. So, if x increases by 1, y increases by m.\n This is the value at which the line crosses the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that every point on the y-axis has an x-value of 0. So, the y-intercept generally refers to the y-value at which the line crosses the y-axis.\nOn a line with equation y=mx+b, the y-intercept is b and lies at point (0,b). This can be shown by plugging in 0 for x.\n\ny = m*0 + b = b\n\n\nYou can find the y-intercept for any equation with variables x and y by simply plugging in x=0 and solving for y.\n\n"}

Most LLCs are best filed as either a sole or partnership, but if your profits will be over $75,000, it will be more beneficial to file as an S-Corp. The distinction is only for tax purposes and will not affect your overall LLC operation.You'll need to file File Form 2553 Election by a Small Business Corporation with the IRS.\nC-Corp filing is intended for very large LLCs.

It could pose injury to yourself or others.\n Limit is usually around 143 lbs. Most pogo-sticks state the weight limit either on the directions, or directly on the pogo-stick. If you exceed the weight limit, you will not be able to pogo as high and it may be a safety risk.Also, make sure you are wearing adequate safety gear, as riding a pogo stick can be dangerous when you are first learning. Be sure to start on a hard surface outdoors with lots of room (not grass, your pogo-stick will sink into the dirt.) Wear a well- fitting helmet, and if you want, elbow pads (knee pads may make it harder to hop on the pogo-stick)., Check the pogo stick for loose parts before you get on. Make sure that everything is secured and fastened properly. You don\u2019t want an important piece to fall off while you are jumping. , Always wear safety gear before you get on a pogo stick, especially a helmet. Also make sure to wear elbow pads and knee pads.\n\n\nAlways wear shoes that lace up and have rubber soles. Never use a pogo stick barefoot or in sandals. Make sure your laces are properly tied and far from the springs. , If you are below 5\u20195\u201d use a pogo stick that is 46 inches. Use a pogo stick that is at least 51 inches if you are between 5\u20196\u201d and 5\u201911.\u201d If you are 6\u201d or taller make sure to use a pogo stick that is at least 56 inches.\n Your pogo stick could get stuck in the ground and you could fall. Don\u2019t use the pogo stick in traffic or in the middle of the street. Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye out for pedestrians, cars, bikers, skate boarders, and skaters. , If you struggle to balance you can practice your balance off the pogo stick. Use a balance board before you get on to work on not falling. This will help you learn to keep control of the pogo stick once you get on.\n\n\nStand in a split stance on the board and try to keep the board still.\nTry putting your feet with one foot in front of the other then slowly rock the board back and forth very controlled.\nPut your feet side to side. Slowly and controlled tilt the board from one foot to the other. , Make sure the pogo stick is facing outwards. Put the pogo stick vertical and place one foot on the foot rest. Hold on to the handle bars and put your other foot on the pogo stick. Try not to put all your weight on one foot as you get on or you might fall over. Place both hand on the handlebars and grip firmly.\nPush down with one foot HARD on one of the foot bars.\n So you don\u2019t lose you balance, immediately start jumping on the pogo stick when you get both feet on. Jump towards the pedals, not away from you. Keep your arms on the handle bars and use them to stay steady and keep your balance. Keep the pogo stick close to you, don\u2019t push it forward. You will have trouble bouncing and you might break your stick. Try just doing one or two bounces at first then get off. This will give you the feel for the pogo stick.As you push one foot down, bring the other foot onto the other foot bar.\nNow that you have both feet on the feet bar, hold on tight. To hop, push down with your legs by crouching down, and hop up by pulling gently but quickly up on the handlebars while standing up completely.\nDo this motion several times, and you will be hopping. Just bring your bottom down near the floor, and jerk up on the handlebars.\nDon\u2019t jump too high. If you jump high you could lose control of the pogo stick and fall. Only jump high enough to be bouncing up and down slightly off the ground. , If you start to fall over in one direction, lean your body away from how you are falling. Don\u2019t lean too hard or you might fall over in that direction or you could start going in circles. , You might have seen people online or friends doing stunts with pogo sticks. Only do what you are comfortable doing and don\u2019t do anything you are not ready to try. Make sure you can do regular jumping with ease before you attempt any tricks. , Once you have control of your pogo stick, you can try jumping with one foot. Start jumping how you normally would. When you have a good rhythm going, take the foot off the pogo stick that is not dominate. (If you are right footed, take off your left foot). Lean to the side of the pogo stick that does not have a foot on it to try to center yourself perfectly.\n To jump without any hands, start jumping how you would normally jump. Then, use your knees to get a good grip on the pogo stick. Slowly take your hands off of the pogo stick handles. Make sure to continue to jump, securing the pogo stick with your knees and using your knees to pull the pogo stick up.\n\n\nOnce you start jumping with no hands have somebody give you a ball. You can use a basketball and shoot it in a basket while you are on the pogo stick.\n\n\nDo not leave it in the rain, snow, or any extreme weather. This may cause rust and other problems.\nDo not leave it unattended. It could get stolen.\nKeep it clean! A buildup of dirt or grime could slow the pogo-stick down and make it harder to hop.\nIf a piece comes off or starts to come off, such as the rubber bottom, Stop use immediately and fix it, get it fixed, or replace the pogo-stick. A missing piece could be dangerous.\nDo not attempt tricks until: you are very good at the pogo-stick, you have supervision by someone who can help in an emergency, and proper safety gear (a helmet).\nDo not use the pogo stick in dangerous places, such as: streets, near edges, near stairs, or near skateboards.\nDo not pogo near small children. They could get seriously injured by your pogo-stick.\nDo not attempt to go down or up stairs. You could, and probably will, hit your face on them.\nKeep your pogo-stick in temperatures closest to room temperature as possible.\n\n"}

Draw up a rough diagram of your house or print out the blueprints and note where you might want to place cameras.

You may want cameras for:\n\n\nFront and back doors.\nOff-Street Windows\nLarge common spaces (kitchen, living room etc.)\nDriveways\nPorches\nStairways;\n, You can buy each piece individually, but it is generally cheaper and easier to buy bundled security systems. At a minimum your system should have 1-3 cameras, a DVR (digital video recorder), appropriate wiring (siamese and BNC cables), and power cords. Unless you are choosing to monitor a large area, wireless cameras with wall mounting should cover your needs.\n\n\n\nBasic Home Security: Get a package with 2-3 outdoor cameras (to monitor doors), and a DVR with at least 3 days of recording time.\n\nMonitoring Valuables/Young Children: 1-3 indoor wireless cameras can cover a small room effectively and stream the footage right to your computer.\n Once you know how many cameras you need, you'll need to think about what specific cameras you want. A home surveillance system can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to well over a thousand, so make sure you consider the type of cameras you need before buying -- the features below should be clearly labeled on the box. While you can buy all of the parts separately, buying a full \"surveillance set\" is usually cheaper and easier to install.\n\n\n\nWireless vs. Wired: Wireless cameras are easy to set-up without drilling or running cables through your house, but the quality can be sub-par the further they get away from the receiver. If you are covering a big area, go wired, but most houses find wireless and easier set-up process.\n\nIndoor or Outdoor: Cameras that are not made to be placed outside will quickly break when exposed to rain and humidity, so be sure to choose accordingly.\n\nMotion Sensing: Some cameras will only record when they notice motion, saving lots of space and energy while only capturing footage when someone is in the room.\n\nRemote Viewing: Many high-end cameras offer the ability to stream their footage to your phone or laptop anywhere in the world, making it possible to check out your house through a provided program or app., In order to store and view your footage, you need a Digital Video Recorder (DVR). This device receives all of the video feeds and broadcasts them onto a monitor, usually a computer screen or small TV. DVRs have a variety of memory capacities that allow them to store a certain amount of video, from hundreds of hours to one day's worth of footage.\n\n\nIf you buy a complete surveillance set the DVR is usually included with the camera.\nNetwork Video Recorders (NVR) and analog recorders (VCRs), also available for purchase, work the same way as a DVR, using an internet signal (NVR) or blank tapes (VCR) to record instead of a digital hard-drive.

You can ask your relative's healthcare worker if you don't know of any dietary restrictions. And of course, you can ask the patient directly when possible.;\n, Find out what he or she likes. If the relative asks for a treat like ice cream or fast food, that would be all right for a one-time treat. However, most of the time, try to bring a healthy meal - one with protein, vegetables, and a starch. Whole grains and raw vegetables are sometimes difficult for the elderly person to digest, so be sure you know what they are capable of eating.\n\n\nIn most cases, the hospital will provide the food, taking into consideration all the dietary needs and restrictions of the patient. If you wish to change from the usual meal, let the staff know that you'll be bringing in a favorite meal in place of the usual meal.\n Once you have the meal in front of you, be sure your elderly relative is sitting in a comfortable, upright position. This is important so that the person can swallow the food safely without choking on it.\n\n\nSome elderly people who are not able to feed themselves may spill food when trying to get it to their mouths, or will drop food from their mouths. Perhaps a towel or adult bib is called for to keep their clothes clean.\n Always talk patiently to the person you are feeding, let them know you are ready to provide another spoonful or forkful of food. Don't just hold the utensil in front of them, waiting for them to open their mouths (although this is sometimes the natural rhythm that occurs). Ask them if they would like a sip of water to help them swallow the food.\n\n\nAsk if you can wipe or dab the mouth when food is stuck around the mouth, instead of just presuming.\n See if they do better with a bit of communication, or peaceful concentration on the task at hand.

Bear this in mind when talking to them as they eat.\n You do not need to finish the whole plate. On the other hand, it may take a long time for them to finish a small meal. Just because they eat slowly does not mean they're full.\n Enjoy yourself. Make the meal a peaceful experience. Remember, someone had to feed you sometime in your life, or you wouldn't be here.\n\n"}

Family members and personal friends may be able to provide a different perspective on the retiree than colleagues, so be sure to include them in the party planning if possible. In particular, ensure that you include the retiree\u2019s significant other (if he or she has one) in the party planning.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, determine if the retiree would enjoy a retirement party. If you don\u2019t know the retiree well, ask a family member or colleague who is a better friend of the retiring employee. Not everyone enjoys a big party, and in this case, a gift certificate to a restaurant where the retiree can have a quiet dinner with a significant other or a friend may be a more appropriate send-off.;\n, A budget will ensure that you keep finances under control and avoid breaking the bank for the party. You will need to consider if you will be required to pay for the venue, and you will definitely want to include a gift for the employee who is leaving.\n\n\nSet your budget and stick to it. When you finalize a budget for the party, you may be able to present it to someone at work (either an employee responsible for company finances or a committee responsible for delegation of money to events outside of the workplace) to see if they are willing to cover any of the costs.\nYou will likely need to collect money from colleagues for the event. This amount can vary, but the requested amount should be reasonable for all employees. You can also let people know that they can donate more toward defraying the cost of the party if they want.\n For example, you may want to invite a lot of people if you work for a large company, so you might need to book a more price-efficient venue. On the other hand, if you want to plan a fancy dinner at a restaurant, you may only be able to invite a handful of colleagues and friends.\n\n\nThere is no right or wrong way to prioritize for a retirement party. Your \u201cparty priorities\u201d list will depend largely on the size and general atmosphere of your company, as well as the personality and relationships of the retiree.\n This guest list should include those people who are important to the employee. In addition to a spouse or partner, don't forget to invite the retiree's children. You may want to ask the person closest to the retiree for help making this list to ensure that no one important is forgotten.\n\n\nIn addition to family and friends, make sure that no one important in the office is forgotten. You don\u2019t want to create an uncomfortable situation in the workplace by selectively inviting some while leaving others out. If this is the case due to budgetary constraints, you may want to explain this to the people who are not invited. A simple \u201cwe\u2019ve chosen only to invite colleagues that have worked with Sam for more than five years because of our budget restrictions\u201d may be helpful to avoid any hurt feelings.\n The venue can be as simple as a conference room at work, as personal as the house of a coworker, as big as a church hall or other public space, or as small as a table at a restaurant. The venue will largely depend on the set budget as well as the \u201cparty priorities\u201d (most specifically, how many people you want to invite and whether or not you want food to be provided).\n\n\nConsider renting a private space so that people are more likely to be able to make speeches and participate in party activities about the retiree. For example, if you decide to hold the retirement party at a restaurant, see if they have a private room that you can book for that afternoon or evening.\n The invitation should include information about who the party is honoring, whether the party is a surprise, where the party will be held, what kind of food will be provided, how long the party will run, what gifts are suggested, if there is a specific theme or expected dress, and if there is convenient parking and/or public transportation (or even carpools) to the party.Invitations specific for retirement parties are available online- a simple Google search will provide you with some options.\n\n\nIf someone in your office is particularly good at art or calligraphy, you may want to design and produce your own invitations. This can also help save money that can then be used toward other aspects of the party.\n Choose something that is appropriate and emulates the type of person the retiree is. Whether it is a material possession, tickets to an event, a gift card to a favorite store or restaurant, or another unique idea, putting thought into a gift for the retiree is an important part of planning a retirement party as it will serve as a reminder of the retiree\u2019s career.\n\n\nIf you have a party theme, take it into consideration when getting a gift. For example, if traveling is the retiree's next endeavor, then opt for a set of luggage that is personalized.\nYou will likely want to include a photo album (or something personal that commemorates the employee\u2019s time at a company) as part of the gift. Include photographs of the retiree and peers throughout the years, along with messages from work colleagues and superiors. This can be put together as a \u201cmemory book.\u201d\nFor a unique gift, consider making your gift a donation to the retiree\u2019s favorite charity.You can write directly on the invitation to donate to a specific charity, and have people donate whatever amount they feel is appropriate.\n Choose a theme that highlights the retiree\u2019s interests.You may want to choose one theme (think travel, golf, the outdoors, cars, etc.) or you may want to choose several different interests of the honored guest as a way to highlight the many dimensions of his or her life. As an alternative, you can pick a popular theme for retirement parties.\n\n\nSome popular suggestions for retirement party themes include \u201cHis or Her Hire Year\u201d (where you feature clothing, music, television, movies, toys, and popular events from the year that the retiree was hired), \u201cCompany in Mourning\u201d (where you ask everyone to dress in black and have them \u201cpay their respects\u201d for losing an important employee), and the popular \u201cPermanent Vacation\u201d (which can be a beach or luau-themed party complete with a Hawaiian shirt dress code and tropical drinks)., While you don\u2019t want to have a minute-by-minute schedule of how the party should proceed, you will want to set aside a dedicated time for party activities such as speeches or games. Making a program can help inform your guests of your desired schedule. Print out the program on a piece of card stock and add pictures of the retiree for a personalized touch.\n\n\nConsider how you want the event to flow. You may want to break up different courses of the meal with short speeches or songs that honor the employee, or you may want to schedule any speeches in the first part of the event so that everyone can relax for the remainder of the party.\n This person should be tasked with keeping the party on schedule. His or her responsibilities will include announcing when it is time to eat, encouraging guests to join in on party activities, and introducing any speakers. You may want to explore the possibility of renting or borrowing a microphone for your emcee, but this depends largely on your venue and other details of the party.\n If you have it in the budget, and if the status of the retiree calls for it, commission a professional photographer to take pictures of the event. Otherwise, designate a guest (preferably another colleague) to be the event photographer or videographer. Documenting the retirement party will ensure that it is a fond memory for the retiree for years to come. Make sure to provide access to these photos to the retiree after the party!\n\n, If you choose to hold the party at a place that does not provide food, you may wish to make it a \u201cpotluck\u201d party, where everyone brings a dish and is free to eat whatever they\u2019d like. This can be a great option if you are particularly strapped for cash when it comes down to organizing the food for the party.\n\n\nMake a sign-up list so that everyone can see what others\u2019 are bringing. Try to make several different columns (including appetizers, mains, salads, and desserts) so that you don\u2019t end up with twelve platters of vegetables and dip. You can also make suggestions and have guests sign up for a pre-suggested dish.\n Having the party catered will enable you to hold the celebration in almost any venue that you want.\n\n\nCall several local caterers to see if they require a minimum number of guests at the party or money that must be spent at the caterer. You want to ensure that you stick to your budget when planning the food for the party.\nPeruse your menu options, and ensure there is food that your guests would enjoy. You will want to make sure you include vegetarian options and options for those with gluten intolerance. Ask guests to warn you beforehand of any particularly severe food allergies or intolerances so that you can be aware of them when planning the menu.\nCall around to find a reasonably priced caterer. It is always advantageous to get several price quotes from several different companies before settling on a caterer. This will help you stick to your pre-set budget.\n If you choose to hold the retirement party at a restaurant, it may be possible to create a \u201cset menu.\u201d This will help you include some of the retiree\u2019s favorite dishes while still providing guests with a selection. In addition, it will help you to guarantee that you stay within budget.\n\n\nAsk the restaurant if you can temporarily rename your chosen dishes in honor of your retiree. For example, having \u201cHank\u2019s Holiday Hummus\u201d or \u201cRosie\u2019s Relaxing Rice and Beans\u201d is a creative and unique way to honor the retiree. If possible, fit in the naming of the dishes with the theme of the party.\n Ask everyone in the room to write something down about the guest of honor based on a particular prompt provided by the party emcee. Invite anyone who would like to speak up one by one, and make sure you have a microphone if you are in a large space.\n\n\nMake up your own unique prompts tailored to the retiree, or try one of these:\n\nAn embarrassing moment I had with Kevin was\u2026\nSomething I thought I would never tell Kevin was\u2026\nThe funniest moment I ever had with Kevin was\u2026\nThe time I was most impressed by Kevin was\u2026\n\n\n\n, You will want to include a whole history (such as his first job, his first boss, etc.) and have everyone try to guess the correct answers (you may want to make this multiple choice). The person who gets the most correct answers wins a prize.\n Ask the retiree's superior to give a short toast that emulates thanks for work done and regret for the employee leaving. A toast should be solemn, but should also be positive at the same time. It is not a time to \u201croast\u201d the employee, but a time for genuine appreciation for a job well done.\n\n\nOther guests may also want to stand up and say something about the retiree. You can either do an \u201copen mic\u201d session, where people are free to stand up and briefly say what they would like, or you can ask people to let you know when they RSVP to the party invite if they would like to make a short speech recognizing the retiree.\n The entertainment should be based on what the retiree would appreciate. You can have coworkers sing a farewell song or perform a humorous sketch about the retiree. The most important aspect of retirement party activities is to make them feel as personalized as possible so that the retiree recognizes how special he or she was to the company.\n\n"}

This will create a much more natural look compared to other types of self-tanner.\nContouring typically lasts for about a week.If you're using a self-tanner for the first time, be sure to spot test it on a normally unexposed patch of skin. That way, if your skin turns out to be sensitive to one or more ingredient, any reaction will be hidden from view rather than all over your face.\n Use your fingers to evenly massage the tanner all over your face. By starting with this base, you'll give your skin a gentle glow.If you've decided to use only one shade of tanner, skip this step., Use a stippling foundation brush to brush the tanner on slightly under your hairline.Focus on your temples and the top of your forehead. Stop just above your cheekbones., Use a sharply-angled contouring brush to apply tanner below your cheekbones. Under each cheekbone, draw on a line from your ear to your mid-cheek. Try doing this with a single stroke., Like conventional makeup, to blend your self-tanner you need to buff it in. Use your fingertips to make circular motions, focusing on the edges of your darker tanner. Buff until your makeup looks even and natural.Keep in mind that your tontouring will likely look much more harsh just after application compared to the rest of your week., Follow the instructions on your self-tanner's bottle. In general, this step takes a few hours.A good rule of thumb is to wait eight hours after applying tanner before swimming or bathing.\n\n"}

(45 ml.) of whiskey, 0.75 oz. (22 ml.) of lemon juice, 0.5 oz. (15 ml.) of simple syrup, one splash of orange liqueur, and one egg white together in a cocktail shaker. Shake thoroughly, until the egg white has broken up into froth; the cocktail will be very unpleasant if it still contains globs of egg white. When properly shaken, the egg white will make the cocktail much smoother on the mouth, and soften the lemon flavor a little.Shaking the ingredients together without the ice first may help emulsify the egg white, distributing it evenly throughout the drink.You can skip this step and just shake everything once, but shake extra vigorously to make up for it.\nThere is a tiny risk of salmonella infection from raw egg white. If you are concerned about this, or if you are serving the drink to an elderly or immune-compromised person, use \"pasteurized shell\" eggs., Now, place a handful of ice into the cocktail shaker and shake the ingredients again for another ten seconds. The ice will help cool the ingredients.\n Pour into a rocks glass or a short-stemmed sour glass. The small mouths on these glasses help maintain the distinctive foamy head from the egg white.Optionally, add ice to the glass first.\n Since this version contains orange liqueur, an orange twist is a thematic garnish.

Spending time with people who really know you and love you for who you are is a remedy for emptiness. Focus on building and strengthening your relationships with these people. You can find meaning in the simple act of spending time with a loved one who takes pleasure in your company. Spending time with friends and family can also help reduce stress and give you a deeper sense of belonging.Reduce the time that you spend with people who are harmful to you, even if they don\u2019t mean to be. If you must spend time around someone who is hurting your self-esteem or making you feel powerless, make sure your meetings always have a time cap.;\n, The pleasure of meeting someone you connect with and letting the relationship grow in unexpected ways is a terrific antidote to feelings of emptiness. A new friend or love interest can help you have rich new experiences and show you that you're an interesting, lovable person. Suddenly the world can seem like it has a lot more to offer than you previously thought. Making friends can also help you to have a deeper sense of purpose and belonging.Sometimes it's difficult to make new friends and meet people, especially in later years when you're no longer in school. Joining clubs, taking classes, or spending time in a favorite hangout are good ways to meet people.\nPractice being more generous with your time and saying \"yes\" when you're invited to do something. If you feel you never have enough time to give new relationships, they won't grow.\n Research has shown that having a pet can make life feel fuller and more meaningful.People who own pets are also less likely to suffer from depression and may experience health benefits from owning a pet as well.Having a companion animal that depends on you for care can also help make your life seem more meaningful. Consider adopting a cat or dog from a local shelter to reduce your feelings of emptiness.\n Performing random acts of kindness can help you feel more fulfilled by refocusing your attention on other people. Look for small ways that you can demonstrate kindness to others. The kind acts that you perform will make other people feel good, which may help you to feel more fulfilled.\n\n\nFor example, you could offer a compliment to a stranger such as, \u201cI love your dress! It is so beautiful.\u201d Look for ways to show kindness in whatever situation you are in. Even something as simple as smiling and nodding at people throughout the day might help to brighten someone\u2019s day and help you to feel more fulfilled."}

Alternatively, your workplace may have a baseball or soccer team. Joining a team gets you active even when you're just having fun., While working your abs by doing crunches and sit-ups can help your overall health, it's not going to flatten your stomach on its own. That's because exercising increases muscle in the areas you work, but it draws fat from your whole body. Therefore, while crunches and sit-ups can be a good workout, you can't focus only on them to flatten your stomach.If your main goal is to lose belly fat, then it's fine to stick solely with aerobic exercise.You should be getting at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week.If you want to add in abdominal work, you can add 10 to 20 minutes to your routine.\n If you're like many people, you may eat when you're bored.

Or, do you tend to think it's okay to throw a tantrum or sulk when things don't go your way? These sorts of behaviors suggest that you're being self-absorbed and expecting others to bend to your wishes.;\n, This sort of focus tends to push aside others because you aren't willing to take into account their needs and wants, and you're unwilling to compromise so that everyone gets something they're after. If you can learn to spot that you're only interested in feeling good no matter how others are feeling, then consider that you may have a problem with being self absorbed.\n Are they strained in any way? Are there too few such relationships to recall? What are the things you hear people saying about your behavior? The inability to have or maintain long-term friendships and relationships can be a warning signal that it's all about you and that you're not giving enough to others.\n\n\nRealize that self-absorbed behavior tends to alienate other people. As social beings, all interactions are about give and take, not all take.\n Self absorption is likely a defense mechanism born of a bad experience or series of bad experiences somewhere along the way. After being hurt by any sort of abuse or neglect, self absorption can be a reaction akin to self protection. It doesn't excuse continuing to do it but it does explain a tendency toward it. Thus, understand that it's a coping mechanism or self-protection and take care of yourself in the process of undoing it.\n\n\nAnother reason can be an early discovery that your physical appearance lets you get away with things, such as easily gaining friendships and popularity or getting other people to do things for you. When this sort of unearned power lands at your feet, especially as a young person, it can be hard to not let it go to your head unless you have good guidance from people who can spot this early and are in a position to also teach you humility and grace.\n Looks fade, intelligence and skills last. Spend a lot of time honing your smarts and your skills and let your appearance simply be the icing on the cake. It may feel unrealistic to you now but in time, appearance changes and doesn't garner you the same, easy favors it once did. At that point, you must fall back on your wits, charm and ability. Thus, spending time cultivating these latter essences of self makes a lot of sense.\n\n\nAvoid spending excessive time on your grooming and fashion. Don't take this to the opposite extreme though. Neglecting self-care is just as harmful as obsessive grooming, so don't sacrifice basic hygiene in order to seem less vain.\n It can be hard to let go of the need to be first, to get the biggest slice of cake, to be heard before others and to feel less in control. But unlearning selfishness is a way of opening yourself up to greater opportunities in life, to experience more connections with others and to be happier.\n\n\nCheck out How to stop being selfish and How to be less selfish for some ways to help yourself.\n Humility isn't innate. It's a self-taught skill that needs to be constantly nurtured and resorted to. It is part of undoing excessive self-concentration and opening you up to the reality that even with the best of skills in the world, an individual is not an island alone but shares all achievements with others. It also helps you to realize that you are connected to other people and that luck plays a part in life's success, not just one's own talents.\n Read a book. Watch a movie. Appreciate the value of things that exist beyond your internal world.\n In that way, you won't so tempted to avoid the hard work of self-change or to make the excuse that other people simply aren't good enough for you to be around.\n Do you hear \"I\" and \"I want\" and \"I prefer\" and \"My opinion is\" and \"I think\" coming from you all of the time? Use this deliberative awareness to begin changing the manner in which you converse with others, reducing these types of interjections gradually to 1 in 3, then 1 in 5 and so on. Substitute with such conversation as \"What do you think?\", \"How do you do that?\", \"Does it bother you?\", \"Where did you get that?\", \"How are you?\", \"What are you working on right now?\", and so on.\n\n\nWork up to active listening. This is where you speak less, listen more and feed back to the speaker that you have genuinely heard what he or she has said.\n When you encounter other people, address them by name. If you're self-absorbed, you're probably avoiding using the names of other people. By doing this, you are treating them as interchangeable props in your own personal drama (even if you don't think that this is what you're doing). Calling people by name will help you start to engage with them as living, breathing, unique individuals. It's a small step, but a crucial one.\n And mean it too. It will help take your mind off yourself and start focusing on the beauty of others.\n Choose a charity or other volunteer opportunity to donate your time and skills to. Be among people who help other people and connect with those needing help. This will improve your humility and also helps you to stop focusing solely on yourself.\n It takes time to become more outward focused but it's definitely worth the effort. Remember to be kind to yourself\u2013\u2013it's an epic journey but you're already doing well by acknowledging the need for change and accepting that there is a better and more social version of you awaiting to be uncovered.\n\n"}

When you sit down to create your own mission statement it will force you to examine yourself in more detail than usual. You will need to learn just what you want to achieve and why you want to achieve it.Express and understand your goals clearly. You might have a broad understanding of what you want to achieve in life, but it may be difficult to put that understanding into precise words. Examining your goals will allow you to focus them into clear and concise statements.Knowing your goals will help you to achieve them more easily.\nRelate your goals and how to achieve them to your values and beliefs.\nMake your statement a way of life. Creating a personal mission statement will allow you to start living your goals and values. After clarifying and focusing your ideals and life direction you will be able to work your mission statement into everything you do.Don't just settle for writing your statement on paper.\nAlways strive to live in accordance with your values and beliefs.;\n, The first main step in writing your personal mission statement will be to imagine exactly who you want to become. Examine the qualities you want to obtain, the relationships you want to have, and the way of life that you want to live.\n\n\nFind a person you admire. Examine that person that you most admire. Discover the qualities in them that you find so admirable. List those qualities and think about how you could best bring them into your own life.Try to make this list as detailed as you can.\nStart practicing these qualities from you list in your daily life. Try to picture exactly who it is you want to become. Envision the details of your accomplishments, your personality, or any future you may want to find yourself living in.For now, forget about how you will achieve this.\nFocus only on what you want to achieve.\nThink of the roles you play. Examine your relationships to friends, family, career, hobbies, or other areas of your life. Think about how you would want to be described in these relationships.Understand your roles and what you want from them.\n Writing your personal mission statement isn't directly about laying out a path to your future. The main function of your statement will be to help you better know yourself. The personal mission statement is focused on self-discovery, rather than creation.\nYour mission statement should be written only to inspire you, not to impress another person.\nKnowing yourself will help you to relate to and engage with the world at large.\n Your mission statement should answer questions about your life and how you desire to live it. By answering these questions, you will be able to live your life in a more focused and aware manner. Some of the most common questions your mission statement should answer are:What do I want from life?\nWhat are my values?\nWhat do I excel at?\nWhat do I hope to accomplish?\nHow do I want to be remembered?\n\n, When you create your mission statement, you will want to list your beliefs. Think about them until they become as clear as they can. Knowing your own beliefs will help you fully understand your own unique approach to life.Clarify your beliefs on a broad level first. Ask yourself the big questions:\n\nHow should I treat people?\nHow would I like to be treated?\nWhat do I want the world I live in to be like?\nWhat do the words Justice, Truth, Love, etc, mean to me?\n\n\nWork to apply the broad beliefs to more focused issues. Think of detailed situations and how your beliefs would be applied. For example:\n\nIf someone is treating me poorly, how will I respond?\nWhat should I do if someone asks something of me that goes against my beliefs?\nWhat profession would be allow me to practice my beliefs?\n\n\n\n, Your mission statement will provide a great approach to life in general. To apply it effectively you may want to examine how your roles in life relate to you mission statement.For instance, think of your professional role. Where do you want to be, professionally, in a few years time? What responsibilities do you see that role requiring of you? What attitudes or practices have you found to work best for you in your profession?\nUnderstanding each role will help us to balance our focus on the roles that most need it.\nOnce you have your mission statement, apply it to your roles and relationships directly.\n Continue to focus your statement by adding goals to the various roles you play. Goals are the most specific level of your mission statement. Think of them as applying your general beliefs and values to very specific tasks and deadlines.Some examples of a goal would be, \u201cI want an increase of five percent in my salary within six months\u201d or \u201cBy next year, I want to lose twenty pounds\u201d\nGoals are the foundation of our roles and mission.\nGoals have deadlines and very specific details.\nGoals allow us to fulfill our roles and realize our mission statement.\n Once you have an idea of what you mission statement is shaping up to be, start living it. See how it works for you and if you are able or still willing to achieve your goals and directions you originally set..Examine your actions and check that they are in accordance with your own beliefs, goals, and values.\nAsk yourself if your goals are realistic for you. You may have to change details of your goals, for example, moving a deadline to a more reasonable time.\nAfter you have a good understanding of yourself, goals, and mission statement, it's time to start writing it.\n Don't worry about how rough it may be, even if it is just a list of qualities and ideas. Carry it with you and work on it when you feel inspired.Your draft should contain at least a rough outline and include the following information:\n\nYour name.\nYour overall statement.\nWho inspires you and why.\nWhat qualities you want to obtain.\nWhat roles you play and how you want to be known for those roles.\nSpecific goals you have.\nBeliefs that you hold.\nAnything else you might want to focus on.\n\n\nEvaluate how well you feel your first draft matches your values and actions.\nFeel free to add or remove ideas or parts of your first draft.\n Once you have worked with your first draft for a while, evaluating and adjusting it, it's time to lay out your information to create the final draft. While there is no one correct layout for your final draft, there are many examples:Benjamin Franklin opted for a list of concepts and then wrote his thoughts about each to form his mission statement. \u201cTemperance: Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation. Order: Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve...\u201dGandhi wrote his mission statement using active phrases such as \u201cI will\u201d or \u201cI shall. \u201c...I shall not bear ill will toward anyone. I shall not submit to injustice from anyone. I shall conquer untruth by truth...\u201dYour actual mission statement could be no longer than a paragraph. Aim to capture everything from your goals, to your beliefs and values. An example would be \u201cI am a responsible student who values and practices hard work and rigorous study. I will achieve and maintain a 4.0 GPA during my time of study. I will graduate with honors by December this year.\u201d\n\n, Once you start to better understand you goals and how they can be best expressed in your statement, you can create a final draft. Keep this draft with you and refer to it often.Compare your actions to your statement to make sure you are living as you intend.\nWork your mission statement into every area of your life that you can.\nCheck to make sure you are meeting your goals in a way that is in line with your own self.\nAdd or remove whatever parts you see fit.\nFind a format and style that suits your own personality best. Don't be afraid to make your own, as this is your personal mission statement.\n Your views and goals may change over time and it's important to have a mission statement that is still in tune with yourself. Review your mission statement to make sure that you and the statement are always aligned with one another.Don't be afraid to change any part of your mission statement.\nExamine any changes with the same scrutiny that you did when first making your statement.\n\n"}

Tomato plants are also significantly easier to grow by transplant, rather than by seed.;\n, Most tomato plants require a 15-gallon (60-liter), 18-inch (46-centimeter) pot in order to have adequate room to develop. Some small varieties may fit inside a 12-inch (30.5-centimeter) pot, but the roots will be restricted and your yield may not be very impressive.\n Sturdy clay pots may look nice, but a pot this large will get very heavy and you will not be able to move it without some strain. As a result, plastic pots with drainage holes and saucers may work best.\n This step is crucial if your pot once held another plant, since it may have left bacteria and microscopic insect eggs behind. At minimum, you should wash the pot out with hot water and soap. You can also use a little bleach for a more thorough cleansing.\n Never use garden soil, which may contain harmful pests and bacteria that can damage tomatoes, which are susceptible to disease. An all-purpose potting soil provides an excellent base, but you can also mix it with equal parts perlite, sphagnum peat moss, and compost to improve drainage and provide additional nutrition. Make sure that any compost you use has been heated to high enough temperatures to kill off potentially harmful organisms.\n You can use a commercial fertilizer safe for vegetables, or you can mix in organic fertilizing components, including soy meal, blood meal, bone meal, kelp meal, and greensand.\n\n\nOrganic fertilizing components can purchased online, and a few common types, like blood meal and bone meal, can usually be found in big chain garden and home improvement stores, as well as specialized nurseries. Feed stores that sell food for livestock may also carry a few organic components, like kelp meal.\n\n"}

Everyone grieves differently, but grief has some common elements.\n\n\nThe five stages of grief introduced by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in 1969 have become a universal guideline for what someone experiencing a loss can expect to go through: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.\n\nYou won't necessarily go through all of these stages in your journey toward healing and even if you do, you may not go through them in order. Still, it's good to know what you might expect and understand that what you're feeling is perfectly normal.\nDepending on the circumstances of your breakup, you may also feel sadness, loneliness, regret, anxiety, guilt, insecurity or a variety of other negative emotions.\nYou may also experience physical symptoms of grief. Headaches, nausea, insomnia, loss of appetite, weight gain, aches, pains and fatigue are not uncommon for someone going through a breakup.\n Keeping your emotions bottled up can prolong the pain you feel. This is the time to reach out to friends and family members who are good listeners. Or if you're not much of a talker, you can share your thoughts in a journal or blog.\n\n\nTalk to someone you trust. Turn to your mom, your grandma, your aunt, even your cousin or best friend. Sharing your feelings and knowing that someone else understands what you're going through can ease the burden of your grief.\nHave an imaginary conversation with your ex. One study showed that people who had imaginary conversations and then said goodbye to their partner had more relief from grief than those who didn't. Write a letter to your ex--but don't send it. Rather than fuming about what you should have said and what you'd say now if you ran into your ex, commit those thoughts and feelings to paper. Don't worry about being terribly coherent, and good grammar and spelling certainly don't count here. The idea is to get the anger, sadness, resentment and whatever other emotions out of your system and onto paper.\n It turns out that using bad language may benefit you by reducing your pain. A study published in NeuroReport showed a link between cursing and pain reduction. , Whatever form it may take, turning to a spiritual practice can help you find peace in the midst of the turmoil caused by a breakup.\n\n\nIn a grief study reported in the British Medical Journal, researchers found that people who have strong spiritual beliefs seem to resolve grief more rapidly and completely than those with no beliefs.Try meditation. Every major world religion has some form of contemplative practice with a meditative component,so choose the one that suits you best. These include yoga, Tai chi, prayer, Qigong and transcendental meditation to name a few.\n Women who hadn't gotten over a relationship by 16 weeks after a breakup had decreased brain activity in the regions associated with emotion, motivation and attention. In other words, their brains physically changed, which explains the inability to concentrate and to get up and go. Do not let yourself go this length of time without intervention. "}

But they will not survive temperatures below 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C).If planted in a pond, these plants must be taken out in the fall and stored in a cool, dry area where they will not be exposed to frost during the winter.\n Unlike terrestrial plants that should be planted in containers with drain holes, aquatic plants do not need a container with holes as the potting soil can wash out through the holes.\n Fabric pots are ideal for aquatic plants. The fabric allows water to soak into the potting soil but keeps the soil in and the flexible fabric on the bottom makes it easier to keep the plant level.Fabric pots are a bit more expensive than plastic pots, though, and harder to move when the plant is taken out of the water.\n Smaller containers keep plants smaller while larger containers let them grow larger. Certain species of aquatic plants also grow better in smaller or larger containers\n\n\nHardy water lilies like the \u201cComanche\u201d (Nymphaea \u201cComanche\u201d),which grow well in Zones 4 to 10, and Cannas should be planted in containers that are 10 inches deep and 15 inches wide.Tropical water lilies like the \u201cDirector George T. Moore\u201d (Nymphaea \u201cDirector George T. Moore\u201d)which only grow well in Zones 10 and 11, should be planted in containers that are 10 inches deep and 20 inches wide.\nSmaller plants like the \u201cKatie Ruellia\u201d (Ruellia brittonia \u201cKatie\u201d), which grows to 5 to 10 inches tall and grows well in Zones 9 to 11, can be planted in a 5-inch deep, 8-inch wide pot to keep it them smaller or a 5-inch deep, 12-inch wide pot to let it grow a little larger., They will be able to tell you which size pot will work best for each plant.\n If the soil in your yard is naturally loamy clay, it can be used for the aquatic plants., You can use a brand like PondCare Aquatic Planting Media.This mix contains kiln-fired clay pieces, provides plant nutrients and anchors the aquatic plant securely in its container.\nWhile sandy soil may keep the plant anchored, it will not hold enough nutrients to keep aquatic plants healthy.\n It is too light and will leach into the water.\n Then, put two to four aquatic plant fertilizer tablets on the soil spaced evenly around the container 2 to 3 inches in from the edge.\n\n\nThe number of tablets required varies, depending on the size of the tablets and the size of the container.\nThere should be 1 to 2 ounces of fertilizer for each gallon of soil.Fertilizer tablets with a 12-8-8, 10-6-4, 20-10-5 or 5-10-5 ratio are fine., Do this until the container is \u2154 full.\n These rhizomes are actually thickened stems that resemble sweet potatoes.\n\n\nThe growing end of the rhizome with growth buds or \u201ceyes\u201d should be placed at the center of the container with the \u201ceyes\u201d facing up and buried deeper than the other end so that the whole thing is sitting at a 45 degree angle.\nThe growth buds or \u201ceyes\u201d look very similar to the \u201ceyes\u201d on a potato.\nThis placement gives the hardy water lily room to grow in the pot.\n The higher end should be just above soil level and the lower end should be covered.\n Their \u201ceyes\u201d should be facing up and the top of the rhizome should be above soil level.Lotuses grow well in Zones 4 to 10.\n Then, cover them with 2 to 3 inches of soil., Then, hold the plant in the center of the container and add more damp soil until the roots are covered.\n This will help to keep the soil in the container and keep fish from displacing the soil.\n The soil should be wet.\n Aquatic plants that get only four hours of sunlight or less will grow very slowly or may not grow at all.\n Aquatic plants such as hardy water lilies and lotus do well in these conditions.\n Cannas and tropical water lilies will do well in these conditions., This will then allow sunlight to easily reach them. Bricks or overturned clay pots can be placed beneath the aquatic plant container to raise it up if the water is too deep.\n\n\nDeeper water will not let the sunlight reach the plant rhizomes or roots to trigger new stem growth.\nHardy water lilies grow best with 1 to 1 \u00bd feet of water covering the container.\nTropical water lilies do fine with 6 to 12 inches of water over the container but lotus grow in 4 to 6 inches of water.Cannas grow well up above the water.They should be placed so that the top of the container is 6 to 8 inches deep.\n Adjust this to 6 to 8 inches if the pond gets more than six hours of sunlight.\n\n\nLotus should be submerged to a depth of only 2 inches until they begin to grow.\nAfter the aquatic plants reach 4 to 6 inches tall, they can be moved into deeper water.\n They will break. Instead, lift the container by grasping it at the top with one hand on either side to hold it level or grasp it at the top on one side, tilt it just enough to get a hand underneath and move it with one hand on the bottom and one hand at the top of the container.\n This will keep the gravel from spilling over the side of the container.\n\n"}

Never force.\nIf you start having trouble lining them up, gently take off the end that has the problem and clean the joint with a soft cloth, which you should be doing frequently anyway. Never use lipgloss or vaseline to ease the joints of the flute together. It will give you a quick fix, but later down the road will give you much more trouble than it's worth as dust/dirt and grime will build up much quicker when they have something to adhere to.\nIf you will march with this flute, make sure that the joints are snug enough to prevent parts from flying off when the instrument is snapped up or down, and definitely think twice about joint lubrication. Marching is hard on instruments, so it makes sense to march with a spare instrument if you have one, especially if there is any chance of rain.;\n, The pitch will change somewhat with the temperature. If the flute cools off between playing passages, you can warm it up by closing the keys and softly blowing warm air straight into, not across, the hole. Feel free to play scales or some music to make it interesting.\n, Remove the moisture by gently sliding the cleaning rod through each of the sections in the same direction \"without\" using a twisting motion. By twisting the rod and cloth, and if pushing/pulling it back and forth inside your flute, the cloth and rod run the risk of snagging a pad or even getting stuck inside! If you use a cleaning swab or stick, do not store it in the body of the flute; the moisture in it will be absorbed in the pads. Also, never store the cleaning cloths inside the case of the flute, as the pads could, again, absorb the moisture.\n Make sure to always handle the flute by the barrel when cleaning, as to not bend the keys and/or rods. Pay extra attention to the areas between the parts of the flute, as this is where the most gunk usually builds up, but be careful not to damage the keywork when trying to reach these areas. Don't worry if there's still some dust etc., when your flute is professionally cleaned, they will sort this.\n, They also sell small tools for doing this.\n If sticky, they will make a little noise when they lift up. Slide pad paper or a piece of clean cigarette paper under a key, then close the key firmly. Never used the gummed edge of the cigarette paper. Do not use dollar bills--they are filthy! Do not pull the paper out while the key is pressed down, as this will create friction in the pad and bladder of the key. Instead, open the key and then slide the paper out. It will be just as effective and pulling the paper from under the keys, but not nearly as harmful to the pads. The stickiness is due to moisture, so make an effort to keep the flute dry. Use this technique gently and sparingly, since it could damage the thin membrane that makes the seal when you close a key.\n The case is the safest place, but if you play frequently enough and have a safe corner, you might also consider getting a stand for any occasional breaks from practice.\n If a key fails to lift when released, look to see if a spring (one of the tiny wires along the rod) has popped out of place. You may be able to push it back into place with the eraser end of a pencil or some similar, soft instrument. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, take it to a music shop or to an instrument repair shop.\n If your flute is consistently out of tune, check the cork at the top of the head joint. Take the head joint off of the flute, insert your cleaning rod carefully into it upside down. The end of the rod should have a line towards the bottom of it which should appear directly or close enough to the centre of the embouchure hole. If the line is not in the center of the embouchure hole, then it means your cork is slightly out of alignment. Corks that are out of position will cause your flute to not properly play in tune. Do not attempt to solve this yourself by pushing in or pulling out on the cork, as you could cause damage.\n Misaligned keys or deteriorating pads, especially, can mean leaks, which can affect your tone. If you find that you need to press down harder on the keys to get the notes to speak best, you probably have a leak and need some pads replaced at the repair shop.\n There are some problems that develop over time and simply require professional care.\n"}

Apply a tourniquet proximal to the injury, i.e. closer to the body, by tightly tying a belt or strip of cloth above the area.\nOnly splint a broken extremity if you have to move the victim for their, or your, safety. Otherwise, keep the person still and calm until help arrives. Speak in a soothing voice and calmly tell them to keep still and that everything is okay.\nProvide basic first aid by cleaning and covering wounds, if possible.\n In the event of a broken arm or leg or injured joint, try to apply a splint to minimize pain and further injury and make safe travel easier. Follow these basic guidelines for splinting an injured limb:Locate a strong, straight object to use as a splint. It can be a log, branch, rolled up towel, or anything else at your disposal. If using something from nature that may splinter, wrap it in extra clothing.\nGently wrap the injured limb in padding, such as extra clothes.\nApply the splint so it overlaps the joints above and below the injury. For instance, if the lower leg is injured, the splint should overlap both the knee and the ankle. Place the splint on the uninjured side of the limb (i.e. not over the injury), if possible.\nSecure the splint with ties or tape above and below the joints. Do not tie something directly over the injury, and try not to tape directly on the victim\u2019s skin.\nMove the injured limb as little as possible.\nIf the person expresses pain, numbness, or tingling in the extremity after splinting, remove the splint and try again. Impeding blood flow with a splint can cause long-term damage to the limb.\n If the victim is unharmed enough to walk, assist them in leaving the area. Keep them as warm as possible by insulating them and using heating packs, removing wet clothes and replacing them, and giving them warm fluids to drink. Take them to the nearest hospital.\n\n\nIf help is on the way, stay where you are.

Was it followed by a smile and a longing look of approval? If so- it was probably intended humorously.\n\nInsult: Was the situation heated before the comment?

If you're on a set salary, you probably get the same amount of money every month after taxes. If you're on a freelance salary or paid hourly and don't work set hours, it may be harder to calculate your salary.\n\n\nDon't forget to account for other sources of monthly income besides paychecks, including things like rental payments from tenants if you own properties; child support or alimony; social security payments, disability payments, or pension; or income from interest or capital gains if you have investments.Add up all the sources of monthly income and write down the total amount. This amount is your total income, and as you create your budget, all of your expenses cannot exceed this amount or you will go into debt. If your expenses are less than this amount, you will have money left over to save.\nRemember that paychecks are after-tax, and so the tax must be added back in to obtain gross income.;\n, Fixed expenses are those bills that come due in the same amount every month like clockwork. When you build a budget, these are the first things that you have to account for, because you can't affect the amount or choose not to pay these expenses.\n\n\nFixed expenses from housing or debt can include your rent or mortgage payment, car payment, child support or alimony payments, or credit card or personal loan debt.\nList each housing or debt expense, and add them up. Housing and debt should account for about 30% of your budget. That is, if your monthly income is $5,000, your housing and debt payments should pay for no more than $1500.\nHousing and auto expenses should include taxes, insurance, maintenance, and fuel (utilities).\n Taxes are a huge expense, but many people fail to account for them in their budgets. You should account for state and federal income taxes, local and property taxes, and withholdings from your paycheck such as FICA and Medicare.Taxes should account for about 25% of your budget (if your income is $5000/month, your taxes should account for no more than $1250). For some people, it will be less and the additional money will be put into your discretionary fund to use on living expenses.Locate your marginal federal tax rate for the current year by visiting the IRS's website at https://www.irs.com/articles/projected-us-tax-rates-2016.\nYou can change your tax burden due each year by setting number of dependents to reduce or raise spendable income.\nAlternately, some people have more money taken out for taxes to get a larger, lump sum refund at end of year.\nThe method that works best for you will depend upon your budgeting needs.\n Insurance should include any insurance payments you must make for yourself or your dependents, including health insurance, life insurance, car insurance, and homeowners or renters insurance. However, homeowners or renters insurance is generally included in housing costs, so make sure not to count it twice.\n\n\nInsurance should account for around 4% of your monthly budget. If you earn $5000 per month, insurance should be $200 or less.\n Your variable expenses are costs that come up in different amounts each month. Variable expenses can include things like food, entertainment, clothing, pet care, the beauty salon, the dry cleaners, or other places you spend your money. You may also include any money you regularly put into savings or investments in this category.\n\n\nFor example, if you own a dog, you may typically spend $50 on dog food per month. But some months you may need to take the dog to the vet, groomer, or a boarding kennel, which can add to the expense of having a dog substantially. That makes pet care a \"variable expense\" for the purpose of your budget.\nThe money left after your fixed and variable expenses are paid for is \"Discretionary spending.\" That means this is money that you don't directly owe anyone but can decide what to do with each month on your own. It should be the remaining portion of your budget.\nFor example, a variable expense is buying food for the month, whereas a discretionary expense might be going out to eat.\n Tracking your spending will help you identify whether you are staying within these guidelines, or if you need to identify places where you can make cuts in your spending. If you spend more than your income each month, you'll go into debt. But if you can come under your budget in any area each month, you'll save money.\n\n\nAs you track your spending you may find that your budget may need a bit of tweaking depending on your personal circumstances-- for instance, severe medical issues might make it necessary for you to spend more money on quality health insurance. That's ok, as long as you don't exceed your monthly income in expenditures.\n\n"}

Someone may be exiting at this floor, and you should always let them exit before you attempt to board. Stand to the right of the doors so that the left and middle is open for those getting off the elevator. Don't board the elevator until everyone has gotten off., There is a lot of debate about this particular point: do you hold the door or not hold the door? When deciding whether or not to hold the elevator, use the following suggestions to guide you:\n\n\nDon't hold the door if you are in an elevator full of people. You will be delaying everyone in the elevator and cramming one more person into a tight space.If you are alone in the elevator, it\u2019s good elevator etiquette to hold the elevator for a person approaching the elevator.\nDon't hold the door for a friend or colleague who has taken a quick side-trip, such as to get coffee or go to the restroom. Never hold the door more than 15-20 seconds on a crowded elevator.\n When the elevator doors open and you see it is full, don't try to be that person that squeezes into the elevator when you don't fit. If you have been waiting in line and the elevator fills with the person before you, just wait patiently for the next. Don't be the person asking for the elevator to be held. If you cannot make it before the elevator doors close, then wait for the next elevator politely instead of being rude. The people in the elevator's time is just as important as yours.\n If you are standing near the buttons, be willing to push a button for someone who asks. You can also ask someone who has just entered what floor they are going to.\n\n\nDon't ask someone else to push the button for you unless you cannot clearly push the button yourself.\n When you step into an elevator, file in so others can board behind you or board on another floor. Stay farthest from the door if you will be the last person to step out. If you are traveling to the ground or top most floor, it's better to stand farthest from the elevator doors after you board the elevator. This way you will avoid inconveniencing others.\n\n\nIf you happen to be riding in the front, make sure to step off the elevator when the doors open on each floor. When in this position, hold the elevator with your hand as the people from the back of the elevator make their way out.\n When you reach your floor, get out quickly so that those waiting to board can do so. Don't worry about letting other people off first unless they are already exiting. Simply exit in a quick and orderly fashion. However, do not shove your way out or knock people over in the process.\n\n\nIf you're in the back, announce your floor is coming up as it approaches. A simple \"Excuse me, my floor is next\" is enough. Then, make your way to the front, or wait until the elevator stops.\n When only going one, two, or three floors, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Unless you are injured, unable to climb stairs, or carrying heavy objects, you shouldn't take the elevator for one floor. Taking the elevator for two or three floors, especially during busy elevator traffic, is also considered poor etiquette.Reserve the elevator for people who have long walk ups or who are unable to climb the stairs.\n If the elevator is busy enough to have a line, never break in line. Wait your turn just like everyone else. If you are in a hurry, try to arrive earlier or take the stairs.\n One of biggest issues with elevator etiquette is whether or not someone should make small talk. Most people are hesitant to engage in conversation while in an elevator. If you must talk, break the ice politely. It never hurts to say \"Good Morning\" or \"Hello\" to people.\n\n\nIf you are with someone, don't continue conversations while riding the elevator with someone else. Put the conversation on pause until you get to your destination.\nIf you want to speak to a colleague in the elevator, keep the conversation light. Never gossip or discuss personal or private information while in an elevator., There is nothing more annoying than having someone stand six inches from you on an uncrowded elevator. If the elevator is crowded, give as much space as you can without crowding others or yourself. Follow these guidelines when standing on an elevator:\n\n\nIf there are one or two other people on the elevator, go to separate sides of the elevator.\nIf there are four people, go to each corner.\nIf there are five or more, spread so each person is equally spaced in the elevator.\n Making quick eye contact, smiling, and nodding is appropriate when entering an elevator. After that, turn around and face the door. Keeping your back towards the door and facing the passengers is a huge break in etiquette and can make some people feel extremely awkward., When carrying briefcases, purses, backpacks, shopping bags, or other bulky materials, keep them low either directly in front of you or beside you. Legs take up less space than upper bodies, so there is more space for bags.\n\n\nIf you are at the back of the elevator and carrying a bulky object, keep it low, announce your exit as the floor nears, and excuse yourself if you accidentally bump someone when exiting., A huge elevator faux pas is talking on your cell phone while riding. End all conversations before entering the elevator, or put the phone on mute until you exit again., Elevators contain a limited space, and in busy office buildings, many people try to fit into one car. Unnecessary movements can annoy fellow passengers, or cause you to make unwanted bodily contact. Jiggling your leg, pacing, moving your arms, or other movements can result in you rudely bumping into other passengers.Texting or looking at your phone is a common way to avoid eye contact with strangers. However, do not text in a crowded elevator. Operating your phone takes space, which is limited in an elevator, and the movement can cause you to bump people.\n Good hygiene should be practiced every day, but especially if you are taking elevators on a regular basis. The small, confined spaces can draw attention to any body odor. Try not to pass gas or belch while riding in the elevator. If you do, excuse yourself. Don't bring extremely smelly food onto the elevator. Instead, bring your food in containers. Never eat in an elevator. Never apply perfume or lotion. What smells normal to you may make someone else very sick."}

However, if you or someone else finds themselves in the following situations, seek immediate medical help:\n\n\nThe sting itself covers more than half your arm, half your leg, a large part of your torso, or your face or genitals.The sting causes a severe allergic reaction, including but not limited to difficulty breathing, dizziness or light-headedness, nausea, or palpitations.The sting came from a box jellyfish. Box jellies have extremely potent venom. They are found off the coast of Australia, and elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, as well as Hawaii.They are pale blue in color and have a cube-shaped head, or \"medusa.\" They can grow approximately 6 feet (2 meters) tall.;\n, To head off the possibility of being repeatedly stung and to begin treatment, seek land as soon as you are stung.\n\n\nAs you get out of the water, try not to scratch the sting-site or touch it with your hands. There are likely still tentacles attached to your skin, and itching or touching them will only get you stung more.\n Vinegar has been shown to inactivate the stinging cells from a diversity of species, and will make it so that no further harm comes from the tentacles , and it is recommended by health authorities. , If you are experiencing shock, make sure that someone has called emergency services and try to calm yourself as much as possible. The more you move around while you attempt to remove jellyfish tentacles, the more venom will be released.\n\n\nTweezers, a knife, or a pair of clean sticks may be helpful in removing the venom-filled tentacles. Do not attempt to rub or scrape the tentacles, as this will cause more stinging cells to fire.\n Drive down to 0% the likelihood that you'll accidentally sting yourself again.\n Studies have shown that heat inactivates the venom toxins, relieving pain better than ice If you are experiencing extreme pain, take a recommended dose of a painkiller, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n The idea that urine was a good treatment for jellyfish stings probably originated as an old wives' tale, and then entrenched itself even further after a Friends episode used it for comedic effect.There's no need to pee on your jellyfish sting!\n\n, Most jellyfish stings occur in saltwater. That means that the nematocysts have large concentrations of saltwater in their venom cells. Any change to the solution of saltwater in the nematocysts will cause the venom cells to fire. Fresh water does just this. Stick with saltwater instead., There isn't any research indicating that it actually works, and it may cause more harm than good., Like adding a freshwater solution to the skin, alcohol may actually cause the nematocysts to discharge even more venom, leading to a more painful experience., After you've removed the tentacles and relieved most of the lingering pain, clean the affected area with warm water. (It doesn't need to be saltwater, as the nematocysts \u2014 which react with the fresh water \u2014 should have already been removed.) If the skin is still visibly irritated or raw, lightly cover the area with a bandage and wrap with gauze.\n\n\nThree times a day, clean the area with warm water and apply an antibiotic ointment like Neosporin. Then wrap the area with a bandage and gauze., Soothe any remaining skin irritations with over-the-counter antihistamine pills, or with topical creams containing diphenhydramine or calamine.\n 5 - 10 minutes after treatment, the pain should begin to lessen. After a full day, the pain should be almost completely gone. If you continue to experience pain past a full day and haven't done so already, see a doctor or specialist for professional treatment.\n\n\nIn rare cases, stings from jellyfish can cause either infection or scarring, but most people avoid these scenarios entirely, even after especially painful stings.\nIn extremely rare cases, people experience hypersensitivity to the venom a week or several weeks after being stung.Blisters or other skin irritations may surface seemingly out of the blue. While this hypersensitivity is generally not dangerous, it may be helpful to see a doctor or dermatologist for assistance.\n\n"}

Generally, it's best for new players to start on \"Normal\", but if you have played the previous games in the series, you may start at \"Hard\". Remember that the difficulty can be changed later on.\n The story may be tough to understand because none of the characters speak, but it becomes more clear later on as you see more scenes and find more trophies.\n In some matches (such as the first one), you may have less than four choices, in which case the lineup you picked will simply repeat until you are out of stock lives. Also, some fights may have you pick either side of a one-on-one match; when this happens, you can pick either side, but you must win with the character you picked.\n If you are on a single secluded stage, you must either KO normal characters by launching them off the stage, unplayable Subspace characters by doing enough damage to them, or occasionally bosses by doing a lot of damage to them. In the other type of stage, (which is most of the game) you must fight your way through rooms of enemies to the last door in the level. The enemies here do not have to be defeated, so sometimes it's best just to avoid them or jump over them to keep your damage percent low.\n The blue ones, which reappear each time you play the level, usually hold useful food or stickers while the orange ones, which hold rare items like special trophies, disappear forever once their contents have been taken. Orange boxes count toward the game's completion percentage, so they are required to beat the game with 100% completion. Keep in mind that you can always come back to a level to get ones you missed.\n Green flags represent completed levels, glowing crowns are levels where you have found every orange cube, and the level with a (!) symbol above it is the next one you must do. If you replay a previous level, you can use any character in the party at the current point in the story.\n Stickers can be put on any characters you want to make stronger. The word in brackets next to a sticker is its function, and the number is its strength. For example, a +10 sticker would make PK attacks stronger, while a +20 sticker would make you flinch less when hit.\n Always do this before you stop playing.\n After defeating the final boss, you have completed the Subspace Emissary and unlocked almost every character! If you wish, you can still play through each level, for 100% completion and the remaining characters.\n\n"}

Make sure you've calculated this date accurately, particularly in small claims court, because you may only have a few weeks. Contact the clerk's office if you're unsure.\nKeep in mind that if you miss this deadline, you may lose your right to defend yourself against the lawsuit.\nIf the court is far away from you, such as in the next county over, you may question whether that court has jurisdiction over you. If you doubt the court's jurisdiction, you must mention this in your answer, or the court will treat it as though you've waived any problems with jurisdiction.;\n, If the coach has sued you in small claims court, you likely can't hire an attorney to represent you, but you still may want to discuss the case with someone to understand what defenses may be available to you.Your state also may have small claims advisors available through the courts who can assist you in evaluating the case and explain various defenses that may be available to you. Check the court's website or call the clerk's office to find out what services are available in your area.\nAttorneys typically will charge a lower fee or a flat rate to simply look over information related to a small claims case and provide you with an opinion.\n The coach, as plaintiff, must prove his or her allegations more likely than not are true. In contrast, you bear the burden of proof with any affirmative defenses you claim excuse your actions.Keep in mind that just because you list an affirmative action in your answer doesn't mean you have to use it at trial. You also don't have to provide any evidence with your answer to indicate that a defense you've claimed has legitimacy.\nYou should include any affirmative defense in your answer that you think might apply, even if you are unsure if you will use it.\nFor example, if the coach came at you first, or threatened you, it may be possible for you to argue that the actions you took were in self defense.\nAlthough much more difficult, if the coach was actually involved in the sport when he or she was injured \u2013 say, demonstrating a move or technique during practice \u2013 you may be able to argue consent.\nIf you attempt to argue consent, keep in mind that courts look at the facts of a case very closely. If your actions exceeded the consent, the judge won't allow this defense.\nFor example, if you're playing flag football and you tackled the coach and had him in a headlock, a judge is likely to decide this goes beyond the consent the coach would have given in that instance.\n Small claims courts typically have a form for you to fill out to respond to the allegations and assert any defenses you believe apply in your case.Typically you must first respond to each of the allegations listed in the complaint with either \"admit\" or \"deny.\"\nBy admitting an allegation, that means the plaintiff won't have to prove that particular fact at trial. On the other hand, if you deny an allegation, the plaintiff must prove at the hearing that the fact is more likely than not true.\nKeep in mind that when you deny an allegation, you aren't necessarily saying it isn't true. Rather, you're asking the plaintiff to prove it. Even if you know something is true, you're often better off denying it \u2013 particularly if you believe there is little to no evidence of it.\nThere is a third response you have available when addressing the plaintiff's allegations \u2013 you can say that you \"lack sufficient information to either admit or deny\" it. The court treats this response as a denial, requiring the plaintiff to carry his or her burden of proof.\nAfter you've responded to the allegations, list any defenses you believe apply to you and that you think you might want to present at trial.\nIn most cases you'll want to type your answer. However, if you plan to hand-write your answers on the court form, you may want to write everything on scratch paper first to make sure you've done it correctly before you put it on the form in ink. When you're satisfied with your answer, sign and date it in the space provided.\nBefore you take your answer to the court clerk, make at least two copies of the completed form. The clerk will keep your originals, so you'll need at least one copy for your records and another copy to have delivered to the coach.\n Take your original answer and copies to the clerk of the court where the lawsuit was filed before the deadline listed on your summons to respond to the lawsuit.To preserve your right to defend yourself, it's imperative that you respond before the deadline. However, even if you lose track of time and find that the deadline got away from you, go ahead and file your answer anyway. The presence of a late answer may convince the judge not to issue a default judgment against you in the case.\nThe clerk will stamp your answer and copies \"filed\" with the date, then give the copies back to you. Typically, you will be responsible for having your answer served on the plaintiff after it's filed.\nService may be completed by getting a sheriff's deputy to hand-deliver the document to the plaintiff, or by mailing it using certified mail with returned receipt requested.\nIf you choose to complete service using certified mail, hang on to the receipt because you'll need it to prove service to the court. If you use a sheriff's deputy, he or she typically will fill out a proof of service form and file it with the court once delivery is completed.\n Some small claims courts allow for limited written discovery, through which each party can ask questions to the other, or request documents the other party intends to use as evidence at trial.Keep in mind that even small claims courts that do offer discovery typically only offer it on a very limited basis, and you must get permission from the court before you send any discovery questions to the other party.\nIf your court provides this opportunity, use it to your advantage by requesting medical bills and records from the coach related to his or her injuries.\nYou may be able to use this information to argue that the coach actually is entitled to a lesser amount in damages than he or she is claiming.\n Other players who witnessed the incident may be willing to testify in court on your behalf, particularly if they are willing to support your claims that, for example, you acted in self defense.Keep the elements of civil assault in mind when you're talking to witnesses. Your coach must prove that you (1) intentionally touched or applied force to him or her (2) in a harmful or offensive manner (3) without his or her consent.\nAny witness who can cast doubt on any one of those three elements potentially is a good witness for you.\nFor example, suppose your football coach was demonstrating a tackle technique, and he asked you to \"come at me as hard as you can.\" He is now suing you for taking him to the ground. Other players who heard the coach's invitation can help strengthen your defense that your coach consented to the contact.\nOn the other hand, if you're attempting to argue self defense, other players who can testify that the coach repeatedly threatened you or even physically assaulted you on prior occasions would be useful.\nOther players also may be able to disprove the coach's claim that your actions were intentional. If you slammed into your coach's back and shoved him to the ground, find out if other players saw you trip, or anything else to indicate that your actions weren't intentional.\n To avoid the prospect of a court hearing and resolve the dispute in a more amicable manner, you may want to suggest to the coach that the two of you use a mediator to facilitate a settlement discussion.Some courts have mediation programs available for litigants free of charge. Contact the clerk of court to see if free mediation is available. If not, find out if your community or neighborhood has a mediation clinic. These services often charge relatively low fees.\nMediation may be particularly beneficial if you previously had a relatively positive relationship with your coach and would like to repair it. This could be especially important if you still want to play on the same team, or imagine you'll cross paths with the coach regularly in the future.\nUnlike court, mediation is a non-adversarial process that focuses on bringing the two parties together on common ground to find a resolution to the dispute that's mutually agreeable to everyone.\nKeep in mind that mediation is voluntary, so it's not as though anyone is forced to go along with a settlement. The idea is to feel out the possibilities and see if you can't find a workable compromise.\nIf you do reach a settlement through mediation, make sure you get the agreement in writing. Although the outcome of mediation isn't legally binding in and of itself, if both parties sign a written agreement it can be enforced as a contract by the courts.\n If you and your coach aren't able to reach a settlement, you must start preparing for trial. Closely analyze the coach's allegations for counter-arguments, as well as deciding which affirmative defenses you want to present at trial.In most courts you'll need to bring at least two copies of any documents you want to present as evidence, so make sure you have everything you need organized and available.\nTake notes of the points you want to make and the evidence you have that proves each point. It's often helpful to put each point on an index card so you can rearrange them on the fly if you want to do so based on the plaintiff's presentation.\nMeet with any witnesses you're planning to call and practice asking them questions. You also may want to use this time to brainstorm questions that may be asked during cross-examination.\nIf you've never been to court, try to take a trip to the courthouse to observe other cases before your court date, so you can get a feel for court procedures and the behavior expected of litigants.\n Show up at the courthouse at least 30 minutes before your hearing is scheduled to begin, so you have time to park, go through courthouse security, and find the courtroom where the hearing will be held.Check with the clerk, or on the court's website, before you go to find out what items are prohibited in court (this list may include mobile phones) and what sort of dress is required. Typically you won't need to wear a suit, but you should wear neat, clean clothing without any large logos or slogans.\nIt's likely the judge will have more than one hearing scheduled in the courtroom that day. Take a seat in the gallery and remain there until your case is called.\nWhen the judge indicates that he or she is ready to hear your case, move to the tables at the front of the courtroom.\n Since the coach filed the lawsuit, he or she typically will have the first opportunity to describe the incident to the judge and explain why you should legally be held liable for his or her medical bills and other damages.Avoid yelling out or interrupting your coach, and above all don't try to argue with your coach or any witnesses he or she may call.\nRather than thinking up insults or criticisms about what was said, listen closely and think about the evidence you have to contradict what your coach or the witnesses are saying. Take notes if necessary so you don't forget to mention something that pertains specifically to your coach's allegations.\nIf your coach calls witnesses, you will have the opportunity to cross-examine them, but use this opportunity to ask them questions that are relevant to the case or to their testimony \u2013 not to badger or insult them.\n After the plaintiff is finished, the judge will give you the opportunity to tell your side of the story and explain why you shouldn't be held liable for the coach's injuries.Speak loudly and clearly in the courtroom so the judge can understand you. While you want to make your points quickly, you also want to make sure you provide enough emphasis to the aspects of your defense that are particularly strong.\nThe judge may ask you questions from the bench. If the judge begins to speak, stop talking and listen. Answer the judge's questions, and then ask \"May I proceed?\" before you continue presenting your defense.\nWhen you call your witnesses, keep in mind that your coach will have the same opportunity you did to cross-examine them. Depending on what happens during cross-examination, the judge may allow you to \"redirect\" the witness's testimony. If you want to do this, ask the judge if he or she will permit it.\n In small claims court, the judge may issue his or her decision on the case from the bench, or take another look at the evidence and information presented at trial and issue a written order within a few days or weeks.If the judge doesn't issue an order from the bench, ask the judge or the court clerk when you can expect the order to be entered and whether it will be sent to you.\nIn some courts, you have to call or come by the courthouse to pick up the order after it's been entered.\nIf the judge doesn't rule in your favor, you may want to evaluate your options in terms of requesting an appeal. Some courts don't allow an appeal of decisions in small claims cases, and for those that do, the reasons for requesting an appeal may be extremely limited.\n\n"}

An essential part of this is making sure you carry your medications with you.\n\n\nEveryone with COPD will have some sort of emergency medication provided to them. Whether it's an inhaler or an oral medication, these can help relieve symptoms almost immediately.Have your emergency medications and an action plan with you at all times. Keep some in your car, at home, in your purse or briefcase and gym bag.\nYou should be able to have access to these at all times. Don't leave home without them and definitely do not engage in any sort of activity without having them handy.\n Your action plan should detail what you should do in a variety of situations. Knowing exactly what your symptoms are is an essential part of your action plan.Although you may know other people with COPD, everyone's disease plays out differently.\nBe certain you know exactly what your symptoms are and what you should do when you experience them.\nSymptoms to be aware of include: wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, coughing.\nIf you experience these symptoms while being active, stop all activity and treat symptoms as directed by your physician.\n Exercising with a friend is not only a fun way to be active, but can also help you feel a little safer and more comfortable while you exercise.\n\n\nThose with COPD may feel nervous, scared or anxious about being active \u2014 even with daily or lifestyle activities. A flare up could cause symptoms which can be scary.\nTo help reduce your anxiety and stress about this, consider asking a friend, family member or co-worker to exercise with you.\nInform them of your condition and give them your action plan so they can help assist you if you experience a flare up of symptoms.\n Since COPD affects your lungs, if you breathe in certain irritants, they can cause a flare up of your symptoms and make breathing very difficult.\n\n\nWhen you're exercising, the increase in your heart rate and breathing pace can make you more susceptible to certain lung irritants.\nIrritants can include: dust, chemicals, pollution, fumes or cigarette smoke.Do not exercise or be active if you know there are any of these irritants near you. Stay indoors or choose another location to stay active.\n Many times, people with COPD end up needing oxygen to help them breathe more easily. You will need to work closely with your doctor to discuss which oxygen tank fits your needs and how to be active when using it.\n\n\nAlthough oxygen tanks can be cumbersome, that doesn't mean you cannot be active. Some are large and will make exercise or activity difficult; however, other tanks are just about 5 pounds, which makes them much more convenient.Consider choosing a larger tank to have when you're at home and also a smaller portable one for when you want to exercise or go out for the day.\nMake your oxygen more portable for you as well. Even if you have a larger tank, get a rolling cart, backpack or purse-like case for your oxygen. This makes it much easier to take along with you.\nAlso be mindful of the tubing. Use a shorter tube when you're going to be out and about. Those longer tubes can get in the way and get caught on objects.\n\n"}

This way, you are not standing at the counter with nothing but a box of condoms. You can also use the other items in your cart to cover up the condoms. This way other people will not be able to look in your basket and automatically see the condoms.\n Convenience stores and gas stations often sell condoms as well. These stores are smaller and have less people. If you purchase from a convenience store, you may have to talk to the cashier and let him or her know that you need to buy condoms, as most times they are located behind the counter. If you do not mind interacting with the cashier, but want to avoid large crowds, this may be an option for you.Sometimes the bathrooms have vending machines that dispense condoms and other small sex-related items.\n Throw away your receipt at the store. You do not want to walk around with a condom receipt in your pocket, wallet, or jacket. If you throw away the receipt as soon as you walk out of the store, you do not have to worry about a parent or friend finding out about your purchase. If your parents monitor your credit card/debit card spending you may want to buy the condoms with cash. You will not have to answer any questions about a charge in your card.\n Instead of using the checkout line, buy your condoms from a store that has an automated checkout, where you scan your purchases and bag them yourself. This will allow you to avoid talking to a cashier. Most grocery stores and large retailers have self- checkout stations.\n\n\nIf self-checkout is not an option, paying for the condoms at a more secluded register in the back (e.g. the hunting section or automobile section) is a good way to avoid crowds of people and you can sometimes also avoid long lines.\n Buying condoms in bulk will keep you from having to go to the store so much. Keep your extra condoms in a cool, dry place. Check the expiration date before you use the condom. If a condom is expired or damaged, it will not be effective.\n If you're over 18, you can visit an adult store to purchase condoms. You will not feel out of place at an adult store because everyone there is buying sex-related items. The people who work at an adult store are usually very knowledgeable about the merchandise and can answer any questions you may have about the different condom options.\n There are plenty of websites that will let you order condoms and have them delivered to your home. The condoms are usually delivered in plain, discreet packaging as well. They typically require payment for debit or credit card but will use a much more discreet name on the bill. You won't have \"Jack's Sex Shop and Condom Store\" on any of your card bills.If you don't have a credit or debit card,,, Teen clinics and HIV/STD prevention centers, Planned Parenthood, and some local health departments offer condoms free of charge with no questions asked. If you have questions, there will be people there who will be genuinely happy to answer them.\n\n\nYou can call the clinic or visit the website to make sure that they provide free condoms.\n\n"}

Wait a minute or so to allow the temperature to heat up, and adjust it before stepping in.\n\n\nRemind children not to adjust the taps by themselves, but rather to ask an adult for help. Turning the handle may seem fun to a child as they may be unaware that the water can get too hot and could burn or scald them.Never leave a child unattended in the bathtub. Monitor the child as well as the water to ensure it does not get too hot. , Make sure hot drinks and liquids are not placed on the edge of tables or counters. , This will ensure that no one is scalded by food or drinks that are too hot.\n\n\nBe especially cautious when serving children.

Some people play a variation in which the dealer can arbitrarily choose how many\u2014or how few\u2014cards to deal at the beginning of each round.\n Once you deal, you should have an extra stack of cards left.

If you think that flicking a Zippo has a place in looking cool, there are several classifications which might feel appropriate.\n\n\nRockabilly\nPunk\nGreaser\nGrunge;\n, Consult a style guide appropriate to your idea of cool if you\u2019re drawing a blank here, or think of pop culture icons that appeal. Don your leather jacket, skinny jeans, studded denim, or oversized flannel, and express your coolest self.\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to embody the 50s greaser ideal, for example, look to James Dean for inspiration, or Grease\u2019s Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John).\nYou can\u2019t ignore the coif! Your hair needn\u2019t adhere to the trendiest cut, but it can\u2019t be ignored. You need to consider your appearance from head to toe.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to bone up on some basic facts appropriate to these subcultures. Dressing punk and then not knowing where to take the conversation when someone mentions Sid Vicious is most assuredly uncool. , The particular \u2018tude you present to the world will depend on your personality and what you, personally, aspire to be. Presenting oneself as aloof is a way to cultivate an aura of cool, but take care not to mistake disregard for others for aloofness. Instead, try to avoid become bogged down by negativity and minor concerns, and present a calm, collected exterior to the world.\n\n\nWhile aloof is often synonymous with cool, others may find true passion to be cooler. You can\u2019t fake passion\u2014and really, you\u2019re never be as cool as you can be if you feel like you\u2019re faking who you are\u2014but maybe don\u2019t be so cared of expressing and pursuing your passion, whether it\u2019s music, drawing, computer programming, scriptwriting, performing comedy, automotive repair, or anything else! You can be trendy in addition to everything else you are.\n If you\u2019re old enough to decide for yourself, it\u2019s certainly your own right to decide whether you smoke or not. Know that you don\u2019t need to smoke to carry and cooly use a Zippo, however\u2014providing a light for others, especially those you\u2019re romantically interested in, can make quite a mark.\n\n\nIf worst comes to worst, you can always light candles with your Zippo, though we\u2019ll make no claim that you will look cool in any capacity while doing this. But hey\u2014you do you.\n You\u2019re decked out in cool apparel now, but there\u2019s a pretty integral piece of gear you\u2019ll need to look cool while lighting a Zippo. That piece of gear is\u2014you guessed it\u2014a Zippo.\n\n\nThe flip-top and wind-resistant flame are what make a Zippo unique among lighters.You have plenty of options when it comes to lighters on the market, but for our purposes you\u2019re specifically trying to look cool with a Zippo, after all.\n Lighter fluid will evaporate after a week or so of non-use, so you\u2019ll likely need to refill your lighter if it\u2019s been more than a week since you used it. If it\u2019s new it will likely be full, but it\u2019s a good idea to pick up some Zippo lighter fluid ahead of time\u2014you\u2019ll be replenishing it often.\n\n\nTake care to wash your hands after handling fluid, and ensure that lighter fluid didn\u2019t soak into any of your clothes before lighting your Zippo.\nThe wick can also require occasional maintenance. If all you can see is charred and black, pull it up with a pair of tweezers and trim the scorched part., Grip it with your index and middle finger on the top and your thumb on the bottom, with the hinge away from you.\n Both index and middle finger should move down towards your thumb, then take its place so that they\u2019re holding the lighter on the bottom. Your thumb, meanwhile, will slide around to the Zippo\u2019s frontside, near the flint wheel.\n\n\nThis is the tricky part, so don\u2019t be discouraged if you send the lighter flying a few (dozen) times in the process. It will take practice and some intense snapping, but if you do it right it'll open.\nWith practice you\u2019ll be able add a little more flair to the motion, flicking your wrist as flip open the lighter.\n Quickly spin the flint wheel with your thumb. You\u2019ll eventually be able to work this all into one, smooth motion, where the flame seemingly sprouts out of the open Zippo instantaneously.\n Zippos can produce a hotter, bigger flame, so take care if you\u2019re accustomed to other lighters. Their wind-resistant nature also means you won\u2019t necessarily have to cup the flame to protect it, but whether you want to still do this or not is up to you. This is about image, after all.\n\n\nWhen lighting a cigarette for someone else, take care not to press the flame too close to the smoker\u2019s face. Hold the flame out close enough so that it\u2019s convenient for them, but allow the smoker to comfortably lean in toward the flame themselves.\n You have two options available to you for closing the lighter, but the slickest method is undoubtedly to flick it closed. Take firm hold of the lighter\u2019s base with the hinge away from you, and snap your wrist toward you. This should snap the lighter closed without requiring you to touch the top.\n\n\nThe other option available is to simply push it closed with one finger. Simply place your index finger against the Zippo\u2019s hinge, then thrust it upward to snap to top back into place.\n Yeah, yeah, practicing in the mirror doesn\u2019t feel cool. But the goal of looking cool will take a little legwork\u2014direct your attention to the makeover montage in any movie for proof of this rule. Besides, taking the time to really put in the work to achieve something you want, even something as slight as \u201clooking cool with a lighter,\u201d is undoubtedly cool.\n\n\nIn order to become an actor, Henry Winkler worked hard to overcome his dyslexia. This eventually led him to portray an enduring icon of cool, Arthur \u201cFonzie\u201d Fonzarelli of notable ABC 70s sitcom Happy Days. , Whipping your Zippo around indoors, or idly flipping it on and off without any need for it won\u2019t make you cool: it will make you look obnoxious. So stay calm! The opportunity will arise, and when it does, demonstrate your new skill without drawing particular attention to it. Appearing cool requires the appearance of effortlessness, regardless of how much work you put into it.\n\n\nThe term in Italian is \u201csprezzatura,\u201d a word that refers to the \u201cstudied carelessness\u201d one exerts in order to allure and appeal. Embody sprezzatura.\n The motto of the U.S. Coast Guard is Semper Paratus, meaning \u201calways ready,\u201d and guess what\u2014it\u2019s your motto now, too. If you don\u2019t keep your Zippo lighter on you at all times, you won\u2019t be able to display your proficiency with it! Make it a part of your routine when you\u2019re readying to leave your home, and keep it near your keys or wallet to help you remember.\n Not just cosmetically clean (though that\u2019s a fine idea for pretty much everything a person owns) but mechanically. The flint wheel in particular can collect little bits of debris and flint, which will make it more difficult to light.Periodically clean the wheel with a small, soft brush.\n Without being overeager, keep that Zippo in an easily accessible pocket. If a friend, new acquaintance, or stranger whom you\u2019d very much like to leave an impression upon needs a light, patting yourself down for fifteen seconds before producing it isn\u2019t exactly the smoothest move.\n Smoking is an addictive, health-adverse habit. If you\u2019re of age (18 in most U.S. States) then the decision whether you\u2019d like to smoke is up to you, but know that your decision shouldn\u2019t be informed by a desire to look cool. There\u2019s nothing cool about the myriad cancers which smoking contributes to. "}

Roth IRAs have an income limit, and those who have an adjusted gross annual income higher than the maximum allowed income for their tax filing status may not open or contribute to a Roth IRA. To determine if you are eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA, use your modified AGI and the http://www.rothira.com/what-is-a-Roth-IRA provided by RothIRA.com.\n\n\nCurrently, if you are single, the amount of money you can contribute annually to your Roth IRA begins to phase-out if your income is between $116,000 and $131,000 annually.If you are married and filing your income taxes jointly, the amount you can contribute begins to phase-out if your income is between $183,000 and $193,000.\nIf your income is below $116,000, you can contribute the full $5,500 annually if you are under age 50 and $6,500 per year if you are over 50.\n You can purchase almost any investment you wish with a Roth IRA and should do some research to determine which investments are right for you. This will also help you choose where to open your account, as not all investment firms provide every type of investment option. Some guidelines when selecting investments include:\n\n\nStocks provide investors with the most potential for growth but also come with the most risk.\nMoney market (or cash) investments may be the least risky options, but they also provide the lowest rate of return.\nThe younger you are, the more risk you can afford to take, as your investments have more time to recover from market downturns.\nInvestments such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds may be easier to research and evaluate.\nFor help choosing specific investments, you could use Fidelity Investments\u2019 online tools to find and evaluate investment opportunities.\nDo not be afraid to consult with a financial adviser or planner to explore investment options.\n Do some research and find the brokerage or financial institution most suitable for you. A good place to begin researching and comparing brokers is RothIRA.com's Account provider list. You may also want to check local banks and investment firms. Compare the following:\n\n\nAccount fees. Some brokers charge annual fees and others do not. Make sure you know in advance if the broker you choose charges annual fees and in what amount. Mutual funds charge management fees which may be \"hidden,\" (not readily apparent), so read the prospectus before investing.\nMinimum required contribution to open an account. Brokers may require an initial deposit of up to $2,500. Some companies will waive the initial contribution limit if you set up automatic, recurring contributions from your bank account. The maximum annual contribution for 2014 was $5500 ($6500 if you were age 50 or over).\nInvestment choices. Brokers typically offer a wide variety of investment choices. They should be willing to provide you with detailed information about those choices.\nTools and information provided. Many large brokerage firms offer online calculators, personal advice, and market commentary from experts.\nAccount funding options. Review the brokerage firm\u2019s account-funding options to ensure that funding your account will be easy and hassle-free. Many firms offer the chance to transfer money directly from a personal bank account.\nLocations. Some brokers are online only and do not offer local offices where you can get a face-to-face meeting with an account specialist or customer service representative. If you want to be able to speak with someone in person from time to time, choose a broker with a local office.\n When opening any financial account, you should name a beneficiary to inherit the account in case something happens to you. Your brokerage firm or financial institution should provide you with a form to designate a beneficiary. Keep this information up-to-date, should your situation change. You don't want an ex-spouse claiming your hard-earned money, for example, when you want to leave it to your children.\n Most brokers allow new customers to apply for a new account online. However, if you have chosen a local broker with a brick-and-mortar office and wish to open an account in person, call for an appointment. To open an account online, visit the broker\u2019s website and follow the onscreen instructions. Some information you may need to provide when opening an account include:\n\n\nYour Social Security number and the Social Security number of your beneficiary.\nYour checking or savings routing and account numbers.\nYour income information. Brokerage firms and financial institutions use this to determine your eligibility for a Roth IRA.\n Follow your brokerage firm\u2019s instructions for making contributions.

They can be very agreeable for most of the interaction, this is to make you let your guard down and trust them. Scammers put a lot of thought into their appearance, they want to blend in, not stick out. They also want to appear powerful, so they may dress in expensive looking clothing. They might also try to prove their power or wealth by showing off. For instance, I once had a man show me his glasses frames and say \"I bought these for $1000\". No he didn't, because I've never seen a frame more expensive than $550 and those were Chanel. He also said they were Japanese, but they were actually German.\n The deal starts off simple, but he/she makes a slight change... it's not too major but they complicate the process a little bit.

Your body produces human growth hormone (HGH) while you sleep. This hormone helps you develop muscle and actually grow taller. So if you're serious about getting taller, get plenty of sleep.\n\n\nSchool-age children should get between 10 and 11 hours of sleep.Teens and those just under 18 should get at least 9 to 10 hours of sleep.\n Whatever you do, take the time to exercise. Exercise is crucial for your healthy development and general well-being. If you want to grow tall during your teen years especially, get in the habit of exercising your body. All exercise is good, and there is no particular exercise to increase height, but doing things that involve stretching and jumping will help to lengthen your spine.\n\n\nTry jumping around by playing basketball or skipping.\nTry stretching out your back and limbs by swimming.\nThere is no specific amount of time you should be doing this for to increase height, but the more the better.\nIt is recommended that people children and adolescents should do an hour of exercise a day to be healthy.To give yourself the best chance of growing taller, try to exceed this amount.\n Some stretches can help you to release your spine and improve your posture. If you stretch the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night, it can help you to become more upright, and thus make the most of your height. Some of the stretches to try include:\n\n\nToe touches. Stand up straight and raise your hands up to the sky, and then reach down to touch your toes.\nCobra stretch. Lie on your front with your hands at your sides and then push up on your hands to raise your chest and tilt back your head.\nBridge stretch. Lie on your back with your hands at either side of you, then, pressing down on your hands, raise your abdomen off the ground to stretch your back.\n If you do all of the previous steps, there's a good chance that you've given your body the best chance to grow taller. Not everyone is going to be as tall as a basketball player or a model. Being tall isn't everything, so learn to be comfortable with how you are.\n\n\nSome people are \"late bloomers\" and only hit their big growth spurt when they turn 17, 18 or beyond.\nIf you are really concerned, see your pediatric endocrinologist. This doctor will be able to give you valuable information about possible medical courses you may take in order to combat low growth.\n\n"}

She'll love these little gestures. When you take her on dates, never make her pay or split the bill. Girls love it when a guy takes care of the dinner bill like it's no big deal. But don't force her to be helped if she doesn't like it.;\n, Tell her she is beautiful, especially when she least expects it. Girls can spend a lot of effort trying to look nice, and it will make her happy that you noticed.\n\n\nMake your compliments meaningful and truthful. Instead of \"Your hair is pretty,\" try \"I really like the way you did your hair tonight! It looks so soft and beautiful.\" Use different expressions, that show that you are thoughtful.\nDon't be ashamed to compliment her or show her affection in front of others. Real men aren't ashamed to show the world they've found a good woman, and your girl will love you for that. People talk publicly about the things they value. She will instantly feel like a priority if you are confident enough to show the world how you feel about her. Hold her hand in the mall or throw your arm around her at the movies, whenever she feels comfortable with it. Make a hint or ask her if you have doubts.\n After you've been together for a while, you can easily fall into a pattern of forgetting to make her feel special. Some guys also deliberately ignore their girlfriends as a way of getting back at them or as a way of punishing them.\n\n\nLet her know you're thinking about her. For example, send her a text when you're thinking about her. Just be sure not to text anything you might not want her friends or family to read. Try texting her \"good morning\" with a short encouragement as often as possible. A girl loves to know she's the first thing on her boyfriend's mind when he starts his day.\nNever ignore her as a way of being manipulative. You'll hurt her immensely, and if you ignore her often enough, she may dump you. Don't leave her waiting for you to call or talk to her. If you're having a problem, speak up. After an argument, wait for some hours or a day to cool down the heated emotions, that the longing for one another is stronger than the anger, and there is a good chance to make it up. Be ready to ask for forgiveness even if you feel she should do it first, but keep your own integrity too. In an argument, both sides usually cause hurt, and each one has the right to have feelings. If you wait many days, she can feel dumped and cut off her emotions.\n Surprise her with flowers or notes, if she likes such things. Whisk her away for an unplanned romantic dinner, day or weekend.\n\n\nTake her somewhere new. Many girls will get bored if you take them to the same place time after time (unless it's a special place for the both of you) so mix it up a little. You should enjoy the variety of new places with her because you'll create new conversation topics and memories together.\nMake sure you plan anything on a free night/day/weekend when you know she has things to do. Ask her about her schedule in a casual way so that she doesn't know you're planning something. Have a Plan B also, if she cannot be part of your plan in a way that gives her pleasure. E.g. if bathing is involved, you may need to know which part of the month it is for her, or she may reject it.\nIf you can, surprise her with a love song or a short poem. Or if you find one that really talks about your feelings, send it or a link to it for her to share.\n Unless she specifies that you don't need to call her back, you need to be responsive when your girlfriend calls you. Let her know she's on your mind even though you are not with her in person. Girls can get insecure when ignored. A confident girl is a happy girl, and a happy girl is good to her boyfriend.\n Even a small gift, like her favorite candy bar, goes a long way. Listen when she tells you about things she wants, and surprise her from time to time by getting her something special. But don't try to \"buy her\" with luxury.\n\n\nDon't buy gifts at the last minute. Invest some time, and put some thought into it. What does she like? Music? Scarves? Delicate bracelets? A special perfume? Does she have any collections? Does she have a wish list somewhere you can buy from? Has she mentioned wanting anything lately? Perhaps you could ask your mom or her best friend for advice. Remembering what she appreciates is more important than the price tag.\nNever forget important holidays or anniversaries that matter to both of you. Listen to hints she may be dropping about what she wants. Thoughtful gifts will show her you care. Bring her to the mall and pay attention to what she points out.\nGet her something she can wear every day to remind her how much you care about her. A locket with a picture of you inside can be an awesome idea.\nIf she gets you a gift for a holiday and you don't get her one in return, she's probably going to be bummed (even if she doesn't admit it). If this has happened in the past, make sure it doesn't happen again, and make up for doing it with a few surprise gifts.\nA gift can reflect how you regard her, and how much you appreciate her. That you are ready to make sacrifices for her. Also a very personal touch is often appreciated, like if you make a custom design item, doing it yourself if you are talented.\nAvoid repeating gifts, unless it has a special significance, like on a day of remembrance. Also, if she finds out that you gave the same thing to another girlfriend, she can dislike the gift.\n Use humor in a natural way. You don't have to tell corny jokes at every opportunity unless she likes that sort of thing. Know what kind of humor she likes. When she's upset, try to cheer her up with some humor. If she laughs at something, try to understand and share the laughter. Show that you like her jokes and funny remarks.\n Remember that your girlfriend is not your \"property.\" Be mindful of her opinions and desires, even if they differ from your own. Don't make her feel stupid just because she doesn't agree with you about everything. Being with a copy of oneself is very boring, and minor disagreements give better perspective on things in life. One may win a discussion but lose her affection instead.\n A woman that sees that her man cannot keep his word, regards him not safe enough for a serious relationship. If you are hindered to keep a promise, warn about it in time, and make up for it afterwards, so she sees that you are a trustworthy man. A broken promise is often seen as the same as a lie. Asking for forgiveness is better than a lame blaming of circumstances. With time she will feel your real priorities.\nShow responsibility with studies, work and money. That signals that you possibly also could take responsibility for a family in the future. An irresponsible man can easily be seen as ridiculous and not a stable partner.\n If you have female friends that you would like your girlfriend to befriend or if you want her to trust you in your friendships with other women, never compliment your female friends' physical attributes.\n\n\nIf you have something positive to say about a female friend, say something about her personality, as in, that she is warm, friendly or creative. Or when it is really obvious: smart, famous, sporty etc. Whatever you do, don't lead in with, \"My friend is coming to town and I really want you to meet her. You'll really like her. She's gorgeous! All of my friends can't keep their eyes off her - when she's around, conversation stops because all the guys just keep staring at her!\"\nUnderstand that your girlfriend may be suspicious of your female friends at first. Always uplift your girlfriend so that knows that she is the only one in the world that you have eyes for. Your friendships with your female friends will be accepted much more smoothly if you follow this step. Avoid much contact with female friends that have no stable relationship, but possibly mention that she could be a good partner to someone else. Talk about the female friend mentioning her boyfriend/husband too.\n Major lies will drive a wedge of suspicion and mistrust between you and your girlfriend that you may never be able to fix. You may throw away a whole relationship with just one act of mistrust.\n\n\nShow her you're trustworthy by your actions. Conversations you have with other women should never border the line of being flirtatious or intimate. She needs to know that she can trust you in speech and conduct even in the little things. If you have a hard time with this one, maybe you aren't ready for a relationship and should instead question why you feel the need to flirt with other women in the first place. Regard other women as humans only, not potential partners.\nWhen you are in a relationship, never tell her that another woman is prettier than she is. If she asks you whether another girl is more attractive than she is, then your default answer should always be a resounding \"NO!\"\nNever talk about how you find some celebrity really gorgeous. Doing this will only make her feel bad about herself, and she will resent you for it. When you do feel the need to comment on the beauty of someone like Angelina Jolie or Scarlett Johansson, always remind your girlfriend that, in your eyes, she is more attractive.\n Open up to her in a way that you don't do for most people. When you show her that you trust her, she's more likely to trust you back. Keep her secrets when she does the same for you. You can show your girlfriend a side of you that you don't normally share with your buddies. Don't tell others about private things that could upset her if she would find out about it - protect her dignity.\n When you\u2019re in a relationship, make sure that you say so on your Facebook account. Be proud of her so that she'll feel confident in you. Show before your family and good friends that you are serious about her, that she will not fear that you might be seeing other girls.\n\n\nIf someone hits on you online, tell your girlfriend right away. If you keep a secret from her, and if she is already insecure, then hiding your secret will make her insecurity worse.\nAvoid communicating with other girls over e-mail, text or social networks without letting your girlfriend know what you're doing. If you're flirting with someone else via text message and your girlfriend discovers your texts, then she's going to be furious. Invite her to take an immediate look at your mailbox if she has doubts. You must make sure even for yourself that you have chosen her, leaving all others girls aside, or she will probably feel it.\n If someone is teasing her, take her side. Girls need to know that their men have their backs at all times, it is an age-old need. How would you feel if she took her friends' or your friends' side over yours? Let her know she can depend on you to stick up for her. In the long run, it is often the man needing the most support in life, so it is wise to show your readiness to \"take any bullet for her\". A man's bright career is easily ruined if his woman doesn't support him.\n If her friends and family don't like you, then they may eventually convince her that you're not good for her. Always act like a gentleman around her friends and family so that they'll encourage her to keep going out with you. You may not like them as much as she does, but you should make an effort to be nice because you care about her. Remember the names and some details about people important to her.\n Never make her feel like you'd rather be with your friends than be with her. At the same time, you need to have friendships with other people besides your girlfriend. Show that you have happiness and a social life also not all depending on her, that you are strong enough to be her support. Just make sure you strike a balance.\n Keep in mind that she could leave you, so you'd better work hard at keeping her happy so that you can keep her as your girlfriend. Make sure that she feels that she loses something great, if she would lose you. If you want to keep her, it's time to start treating her like a gentleman should. Don't expect a great girl to be available again...\n\n\nDon't put your hobbies, video games, YouTube, music or other things you like before her. Never listen to music with headphones on when she's sitting there next to you, even if one earbud is out. If you have a duty of work or studies that disturbs, explain why and for how long.\nWhen she goes on a date with you, she doesn't go there so that you can play games on your iPhone and text your buddies. If you do things like that, she'll think you're rude and that you don't want to spend time with her, as any other person would think. After all, you can do that stuff as much as you'd like when she's not around. If she thinks you spend much time with less serious things, she can assume that you will not work hard for a good income later, but be a financial burden to her instead.\n Don't smother your girlfriend. You want her to be excited each time she sees or hears from you. If you smother her, she may become overwhelmed, which could ruin a good relationship. There is time for everything, and if one feels that time for studies, work, hobbies or sleep is wasted for little things, it can become a reason of strain instead of joy. Help each other to be efficient, to spend relaxed quality time together whenever possible.\n If she mentions something you do that bothers her, change your behavior gladly.\n\n\nGirls will only take so much hurt in a relationship. If you are constantly hurting her, then you're going to lose her. Some girls can and will take some low blows from their boyfriends, but in time, she will realize that she can find someone who will treat her like she wants to be treated. Also, if you hurt her badly, she will tell her friends about it.\nYou shouldn't change who you are, but when it comes to minor issues, relationships require compromise from both ends. She should be willing to do the same for you. Both should be equally content at the end of the day, but sometimes you must take the first step. If it feels one-sided and one doesn't feel happy at the end, then there is no base for a relationship.\n\n\n\nA woman may feel belittled if the man does too much, and doesn't give her the space to be in the leading position at times, like paying for a meal, or helping the man. Some women will feel humiliated if they cannot invite at every second or third date, especially in cultures with improved gender equality. If they have an income, they also may want to show ability not to be a free rider, needing a man for their own welfare. It should all be about love, not mere benefits. Balance in all, with certain mutuality, gives chances for a healthy relationship. Attention to the other's emotions is more important than rigid gender roles.\n\n\n\nEach person has a unique set of love languages, things that can touch their heart that they feel loved and cherished, while other expressions perhaps don't excite at all. The most common are probably: kind affirming words (not pure flattering), time priority, actions of service, gifts, physical touch, really understanding the other, remembering details once told, and showing no regard to obvious faults. E.g. a flower can for a lady mean as much as a home-cooked meal means to a typical man, and as little vice versa. Explain your own love language too, that she will not feel bad if she does things with a kind intention that don't make you excited.\nKind massage is however a trump card, few people dislike it - if the situation is appropriate - perhaps starting with the feet is less intimidating, and a pure gesture of thoughtfulness without erotic associations.\nGirls know that guys can \"show love\" in order to get sex, and will feel used and cheap if that is perceived. If she feels disrespected once, it can create fear in her heart, that it will happen again. Never think that \"sex\" is at all the same as \"making love\" to a woman - make sure it will be for HER. Show love to make her feel fulfilled, and sooner or later she cannot resist, but wants to show love in her own way, which a guy really understands...\n\n"}

Try to go beyond noticing her clothes and makeup, because she might do that more for other people than herself. Try to think about something that she really cares about. For example, she might be really proud of her ability to play an instrument. Or maybe you know she strives to be a good mother someday and you see that she\u2019s really good with kids. These are good things to compliment.\n\n\nFor example, say something like, \u201cYou\u2019re so loving and gentle with everyone, even when they make it really hard. That\u2019s wonderful. I wish there were more people like you.\u201d\n\n, Think about how she talks about others. You\u2019ve probably seen her compliment someone before or talk about someone or something that she admired. Look for key phrases like \u201cI wish I...\u201d, since this tells you very directly what she wants for herself. Now, think about when she\u2019s shown that quality in her day to day life. Many women do at least occasionally show the qualities that they so admire but don\u2019t think they have. By showing her that she can be the person she wants to be, you\u2019ll earn a lot of points.\n\n\nFor example, say something like, \u201cI think it\u2019s funny that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re smart like him. I mean, there\u2019s no way I could have done that report last year without your help.\u201d\nYou can also say something like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about being patient like Gina. You\u2019re not only patient, you\u2019re also very understanding. Just look at how you handled that whole thing with Frank!\u201d\n\n, Look at the character faults and bad habits that you know she works really hard on to improve and then commend her when she achieves success. You might not want to directly mention that this is something she has to work really hard on, but complimenting her on the behavior when she does do it can be really uplifting. You know how hard it is to make yourself a better person!\n\n\nFor example, say something like, \u201cYou really kept your head in that meeting. I admire that...I don\u2019t think I could have,\u201d after she stays cool (despite a history of sarcasm and defiance) while your boss is grilling everyone.\n Complimenting beauty is tricky. Many women do like to get compliments like this! However, it can have many negative consequences for both of you. She\u2019s probably used to people telling her she\u2019s beautiful to try to get what they want from her. It can also have long-term consequences, in that she might think you only like her because she\u2019s pretty (which she will not always be, as she ages, creating self-doubt). Use compliments about her beauty sparingly and use them in a context where it really makes sense, like when you\u2019re together for a special occasion.\n\n\nFor example, say something like, \u201cAndrea may be the bride but you\u2019re the most beautiful woman in the room to me.\u201d\n\n, Complimenting something new about her will show her that you care enough to pay attention to her. Generally, it is not expected that men will notice things like a change in her hair or a new pair of earrings, so when you do you\u2019re pretty much hitting a home run. Of course, this means that you\u2019ll have to actually pay attention.\n\n\nFor example, say something like, \u201cI don\u2019t really \u2018get\u2019 shoes but there\u2019s something about those shoes that says you\u2019re going to own this room today.\u201d\n\n, Compliments are far more meaningful when they\u2019re natural \u2014 when you just speak exactly what you think as you\u2019re thinking it, reacting to the specific situation that you\u2019re in. This is because it communicates to her that you didn\u2019t have time to plan it or that you weren\u2019t pulling a stock compliment from some pickup artist website. It shows her that you\u2019re honest. When you see her doing or saying something that you admire, just tell her that.\n\n\nOf course, this can be kind of dangerous. You\u2019ll need to think about how this compliment would sound. Just take half a second and try to see the compliment from her point of view. Does it highlight that she\u2019d previously been doing something wrong? Does it make her sound weak, dumb, or anything else really negative like that? Learning how to truly hold respect for her can help you not screw up in situations like this.\n Don\u2019t just compliment something really generic about her (\u201cYour hair looks nice\u201d, \u201cYou have beautiful eyes\u201d). Specificity is your friend, because it tells her that you\u2019re not just pulling stock compliments so that you have a compliment to give her.Instead of those flops, say something like \u201cYour eyes just make your whole face look so bright and happy\u201d or \u201cI love it when you put your hair up like that because I get to see so much more of your beautiful face\u201d.\n Try to be creative when you compliment her. It\u2019s nice to compliment things like hair and eyes, if done correctly as discussed above, but it\u2019s still a compliment that gets taken out a lot. You\u2019re not the first person to tell her she has nice hair, you know? Get creative with your compliments to really show her that she\u2019s the one with your attention and that you\u2019re not just trying to get any girl.\n\n\nTry compliments like \u201cI love it when you talk because your voice sounds like home to me\u201d or \u201cYou are so elegant, you remind me of Audrey Hepburn\u201d.\n You want to compliment things that she has control over, since complimenting things she can\u2019t control can lead to tension and self-doubt in the future. Imagine a woman who only ever received the compliment \u201cYou look beautiful\u201d: she\u2019ll be proud and happy at the time, but she\u2019ll come to identify a big part of her worth as being \u201cbeautiful\u201d. As she ages, she\u2019ll be less traditionally beautiful and she might experience very bad self esteem. You don\u2019t want that!\n\n\nExamples of things that she can control are: her education, her determination, her skills, her accomplishments, her personality, and her interactions.\nExamples of things that she cannot control are: her eyes, her skin color, anything relating to age, and her overall beauty.\nBesides, complimenting a woman on something she can\u2019t control is like someone complimenting you on your neighbor\u2019s new job. You didn\u2019t really have anything to do with it, so it\u2019s more difficult to be happy or flattered.\n Don\u2019t. Just don\u2019t do it. There is zero chance that saying something like \u201cHey sexy girl, you wanna get with this?\u201d is going to help your case. Even \u201cclassy\u201d sexual comments aren\u2019t good. Just avoid any compliment or comment that implies or states that you want to have sex with her, when she\u2019s not your girlfriend. Women are in the unfortunate position of constantly having to question if the random guy that starts giving her sexual comments is just honestly trying his best or if he\u2019s a potential rapist. Don\u2019t leave that question open in her mind where you are concerned.\n Cheesy compliments can also easily sound cookie cutter and a lot like you\u2019re trying too hard. This is because real cheesy compliments, which usually involve comparing her to a rose or a moon (for example), are insincere. They\u2019re done for effect, not because they have anything to do with your specific lady.\n\n\nYou might make cheesy compliments like \u201cYour smile is like a summer day\u201d passable, if the context is right and you really, honestly mean it. In general, avoid any compliment that sounds like it might have come out of a romance novel or a guy at a gross bar, though. It\u2019s hard to make them work.\n You want to be careful about any compliments which work by putting others down. While these compliments can be very flattering to her, they\u2019ll say something about your personality that you might not intend. When a woman hears compliments that work by putting other people down, especially people she cares about, she starts to think that you generally build yourself up by putting others down...and she\u2019ll wonder if she\u2019s next.\n\n\nFor example, don\u2019t say something like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Becky getting all the guys. I think you\u2019re way prettier than her.\u201d\nInstead say something like, \u201cI know you think Becky gets all the guys but I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much. You\u2019ve got everything that a good guy is looking for...you just have to give yourself a chance to let all that shine through!\u201d\n\n, No one wants to feel like just another drop in the ocean, and on a planet of a couple billion people, that\u2019s not too hard. By giving her a compliment that makes her feel unique or significant in some way that makes her feel like she matters, then you\u2019ll really warm her heart. This can actually be one of the most effective compliments. Of course, who she is will really have an effect on what you say, so you\u2019ll really need to rack your brain on this one.\n\n\nFor example, if she\u2019s done a lot of volunteer work, say something like, \u201cHave you ever heard of the whole Pay It Forward thing? You probably don\u2019t give yourself enough credit for it, but every positive difference you make just radiates outward and creates more wonderful things in the world. I think what you\u2019re doing is really incredible.\u201d\n\n, You might feel inclined to compliment a woman you know on her weight loss but this can be very tricky. Many women are sensitive about their weight (so are men!) and some women may have lost weight for bad reasons. For all you know, she might have cancer. You should only compliment her on her weight loss if you know it was an actual effort on her part. Now, for choosing the right words:\n\n\nDo NOT compliment her by comparing her to how she used to look (aka \u201cYou look so much better now!\u201d).\nTry to compliment the larger effect that the weight loss has had. This might take the form of \u201cYou look so healthy and energetic today\u201d or something like \u201cYou seem so much happier and confident lately.\u201d\nThe best route is to compliment her actual effort at getting healthier. This is the thing she\u2019s done that\u2019s truly admirable. Go for something like, \u201cYou are my inspiration to make positive changes in my life too. I hope I can be as determined and committed as you!\u201d\n\n, Yeah, you\u2019re probably hoping that your compliment will have some positive outcome for you. A date, sex...even just a deeper connection. But it\u2019s good for you to realize that sometimes, a compliment isn\u2019t the best way to achieve what you\u2019re wanting to achieve. In fact, polling has shown that only about half of women will even remotely be happy about the compliment you just gave her.Many women have really negative associations with particular kinds of compliments given in particular settings, because they have to deal with so much street harassment. Sometimes, any compliment may be the wrong thing to say to a girl (talking to a girl you don\u2019t know on the subway comes to mind!). Honest conversation may get you further. Just talk to her like you\u2019d talk to anyone else and let your great personality catch her eye instead of your words.\n If you compliment her all the time, eventually the \u201cspecial\u201d feeling can start to wear off.How often is too often is difficult to gauge, but you should generally try to save compliments for special occasions and times when you feel like it\u2019s really important. You know that feeling you get where you think your heart might just burst from how wonderful she is? That\u2019s a good time to compliment her. When she\u2019s clearly beating herself up about something? That might be a good time to point out that she\u2019s got stronger traits that are going to carry her through.\n\n\nThe point of a compliment is to make her feel good; it\u2019s not actually about earning you points. That means that compliments should be saved for times when it\u2019s really important to make her feel good about herself.\n Women can almost always tell when you\u2019re not being genuine with your compliment. This is why things will often go wrong if you\u2019re trying to compliment a girl you\u2019ve never met: you don\u2019t really know her so how can you know anything actually worth complimenting. Whatever you compliment her on, you have to really mean it. You have to honestly think that it\u2019s a good thing. Your earnest belief will come across and, even if it\u2019s a little cheesy, she\u2019ll be really flattered.\n\n\nThis is why we feel really good when kids give us a compliment. It might not always be worded in the perfect way and it might be complimenting something kind of weird, but kids haven\u2019t learned how to flatter people to get what they want. When they compliment us, they mean it, and it\u2019s extremely heartwarming, even if the delivery sucks.\n Now, you might hear advice telling you that you\u2019ll be more likely to score with a girl if you give her a compliment that insults her just a little bit, making her think that her only chance is with a guy like you (who \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about her \u201cfaults\u201d). If this works with any girls at all, it will only work with women who have very low self-confidence. They are not the kind of women that you want to date. Instead, when you compliment her, be respectful.\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, don\u2019t say anything to her that you wouldn\u2019t say to your own mother or sister. If your mom would hit you on the head for saying that, then you probably shouldn\u2019t say it to another women either.\n Right after she gives an important presentation is a bad time to compliment your coworker on her dress; this tells her that all that hard work she just put in didn\u2019t catch your notice and that all you can think about her is what she looks like (even if that\u2019s not true). This is a good example of the principle behind choosing when you compliment a woman. Any compliment on any subject needs to be presented at a time where she won\u2019t get the impression you just want something out of her (to a stranger on a train platform, to your wife when you climb in bed, to your coworker before you ask her to take on a project). You\u2019ll also want to pay attention to the context. The wrong subject for the setting can kill a compliment, as in our example.\n Show your affection or admiration in your actions instead of trying to come up with a compliment. Actions show sincerity and they might save you from a bad case of foot-in-mouth. If you\u2019re worried that you\u2019ll screw up the delivery of your compliment or that your words might somehow offend her, show her through actions instead.\n\n\nFor example, when you see her buy a sandwich for a homeless guy, sit her down and cook her dinner later that night (or even take her out to a fancy restaurant). You don\u2019t have to take actions like these every time she does something wonderful: just like verbal compliments, save them for when you think they really matter.\n\n"}

Answer the child\u2019s questions and make sure you don\u2019t push the child\u2019s curiosity by explaining what they seem uninterested in.\n\n\nConsider what prompted your child to ask about cremation to help guide the conversation. For example, did they over hear that a loved one was going to be cremated instead of buried and wonder what that meant? Or did they hear it from a friend or while watching TV? Use the situation as a way to tailor your discussion of cremation.\n Using such words can have a negative impact on the child. Telling a child that their grandmother will be burned or placed in a fire can cause fear. It\u2019s important that the child is not scared by the concept of cremation.Don\u2019t say, \u201cGrandma wanted to be cremated. This means her body will be burned.\u201d\nInstead try saying, \u201cGrandma wanted to be cremated when she died. This means that her body will be placed in a very hot room until her body turns into soft ashes.\u201d\n\n, Cremation can sound scary to children, and many are afraid that the deceased will experience extreme pain as their remains are burned. You can avoid this by reassuring them pain is not part of the process.Try saying, \u201cAnna, I want you to know that Daddy will not be hurt when he is cremated.\u201d\n\n, If you are spiritual or religious, explain the soul will not be harmed. For families who believe in the concept of a soul, it\u2019s important the child knows the deceased\u2019s spirit or soul will not be affected by the process of cremation.Try saying, \u201cGrandma\u2019s body will be turned into soft ashes, but her spirit will not be harmed because it left her body when she passed on.\u201d\n\n, Do not go into detail unless the child asks you for specifics. Some children will be extremely curious about precisely how the process of cremation works. If the child wants details, try conveying some of the following information to them.Try saying, \u201cThere won\u2019t be any smoke or smell when Mommy is cremated. It will just get very hot \u2013 about three times as hot as our oven gets \u2013 and this heat will turn everything into soft ashes except some pieces of bone.\u201d\nYou can also say, \u201cAfter cremation what\u2019s left of Uncle Tom\u2019s body will look similar to kitty litter. However the remains will be white because they are made of bone.\u201d\n\n, Letting a child know where their loved one\u2019s ashes will end up after cremation can help them find peace and closure. Discuss the deceased\u2019s wishes with the child, whether it be the scattering of ashes or their memorialization in an urn.\n\n\nTry saying, \u201cAunt Ashley really loved the farm where we grew up in Kentucky. She wanted her ashes to be scattered there after her death, which is why we are traveling there next week.\u201d\nIf the deceased\u2019s ashes will be memorialized in an urn, say to the child, \u201cDaddy wanted to be close to us always and asked that his ashes be placed in a special container called an urn.

It is not unusual to feel angry or scared when you first start this process.\n\n\nYou might say, \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m really not happy about wearing this brace, so if you hear me getting too negative try to find a way to cheer me up.\u201d\n\n, You are not alone, even if you feel like it initially. Go online and look for a network of people going through a similar experience as yourself. For example, if you are wearing a back brace due to a sports injury, you can find a blog to contribute to. If you are wearing a brace due to scoliosis, you should consider joining a Curvy Girls chapter.\n Before each visit write down a list of your noticeable improvements, your concerns, and any questions that you may have. Get to your most important points first and don\u2019t be afraid to make another appointment if you need more discussion time.\n\n\nFor example, you might ask your doctor if you could see a series of x-rays showing your progress over time. You could also ask for an estimate as to when you can quit wearing your brace., If you feel weighed down emotionally and are struggling with negativity, you may want to make an appointment with a therapist. This will provide you with another space for safe conversation about your fears and hopes related to the bracing process."}

Different forms must be filed from state to state and there may be taxes you need to pay depending on your cause or location. Before you begin planning a fundraiser, review your state's fundraising guidelines on your government website. If you have any questions, reach out to a local non-profit and ask for advice and insight.;\n, Knowing your audience is key to running a successful fundraiser. Try to get a sense of what types of donors flock to what types of fundraisers. This will give you a better sense of what kind of fundraiser to run.\n\n\nReview attendance records and donation records for the cause you're supporting. Look at demographics. Is the crowd older, younger, liberal, conservative? You can get a sense of what kind of fundraiser would be most successful based on this data.If you're working with an older crowd, you might want to fall back on more traditional fundraisers. Things like bake sales and charity auctions might work best. A younger crowd might be more drawn to something light and fun like a karaoke contest. Younger people also tend to be more tech savvy, so online crowd-funding campaigns may be more appealing., Some charities are more effective than others, and you want to make sure that your money will be spent as well as possible. Consider charity rating websites, and testimonials from the community.\n\n\nSome charities are considered unhelpful by the community they claim to support. For example, many breast cancer awareness campaigns spend more money on hypersexualized awareness ads than on helping survivors,and Autism Speaks exploits and dehumanizes autistic people.Do your research, and look for charities that aren't torn with controversy.\n If you want to run a fundraiser, it's a tough job to do alone. Get a team together of like-minded individuals who believe in the same cause. Work together to put on a successful fundraiser.\n\n\nIn most areas, there are groups dedicated to a variety of causes. See if you can find a relevant group in your area, attend a meeting, and see if anyone is interested in helping with a fundraiser.\nChurches are also big on fundraisers. If you attend church, try seeking out help there.\nYou can advertise on websites like Facebook and Craig's List that you're looking for volunteers to help with a fundraiser.\n If you're catering to a more traditional audience, consider sticking to the classics. Fundraisers like bake sales and gift wrapping have existed for a long time for a reason. They work.\n\n\n\nHave a bake or craft sale. Bake sales and craft sales allow the community to participate by contribute homemade goods. If planned around a holiday, attendance is generally higher as people are looking for Christmas presents.Host a party. This is great if you're trying to raise funds locally, or want to target your friends but not pressure them into a donation. Host a party with clear message and inform guests about the opportunity for donating. Give a short presentation on the cause during the gathering if possible.\n\nHold a car wash. Another classic fundraiser, the car wash is still an effective fundraiser, especially in the summer months.\n\nSet up a dinner fundraiser. If you're running a fundraiser for a larger organization, you can try a fundraising dinner. You'll need to find a venue and prepare the menu, but you'll be able to charge per plate, which can lead to a lot of donations.\n\nHold a raffle. If you can come up with some good prizes, you may be able to hold a raffle. Be sure to check the local regulations on holding raffles, as they may be considered gambling and require a permit.\nConsider gift wrapping if you're fundraising around Christmas. You can charge patrons a small fee to have their items custom gift wrapped for a cause., If you're interested in a bigger fundraiser, consider networking with local businesses. This can be a fun way to entice people to participate.\n\n\n\nCheck with local businesses to see if any are willing to donate prizes. This can often be accomplished by agreeing to advertise the the store that donated when discussing the prizes. You can also see if a local business would be willing to host a fundraiser and put a portion of their profits towards your cause.\n\nHold an auction. Auctions can be an effective way to raise a lot of money, especially if you can get local businesses to contribute desirable prizes. A silent auction is a great way to supplement another event, as guests can take a look during a lull in the activity.\n\nSet up a booth at an event. Fairs, carnivals, sporting events, and other public gatherings can be great places to set up a booth to raise awareness for your cause and solicit donations. It will require gathering materials, but you can reuse the booth whenever you need to fundraise at another event., In recent years, crowdfunding has taken off as a potential way to run a personal fundraiser. There are a variety of websites online that allow you to create a fundraising campaign for virtually any personal cause. Anyone that visits the page can donate any amount they'd like. Many crowdfunding sites allow you to set up different tiers of donations, with the expectation that higher tiers will be rewarded in some way.\n\n\nA successful crowdfunding campaign requires a very catchy or compelling statement and description in order to stand out from the thousands of active campaigns. You'll have to advertise on social media heavily.\nDue to the newer nature of crowdfunding campaigns, it might be best to crowdfund if you're targeting a younger demographic.\n People get excited at the opportunity to compete. Consider having some kind of contest, with entry fees or entrance fees going towards your cause.\n\n\nTry a cooking or baking contest. Allow people to compete for best dish and show off their cooking and baking skills. Events like this can be a lot of fun and tend to draw in a crowd.Try some kind of sporting event. Marathon charities tend to be very popular events. Try having a hockey or basketball tournament and donations can be made in the form of tickets purchased. You can also consider selling concession items at the game and putting that money towards your cause.Consider a karaoke contest. Karaoke is a lot of fun and tends to draw in a big crowd. Talk to a local bar that offers karaoke and see if they'd be willing to host., If you're fundraising for a specific organization, contact that organization beforehand. Many organizations have specific regulations that must be followed in regards to fundraising. They may also have specific ways funds are transferred to their organization. Contact the HR department of the organization you want to work with and make sure your in accordance with their policy.\n Once you've settled on a campaign, you'll need to advertise. Make sure you do so appropriately and effectively.\n\n\nThe way you advertise depends on your audience. Older demographics tend to prefer traditional forms of advertisement, like flyers and radio ads. Younger demographics are most likely to make plans via social media.Send out invitations if you're doing something like a dinner. A classy invitation can entice people to want to come to your event. If invitations stretch your budget, consider evites., Many local banks will work with you to set up a fund that your donors can contribute to. This is especially useful if you are trying to collect funds for a family in the area or for a renovation project. Stop by your local bank and ask them about creating a bank account for your event.\n One of the hardest parts of fundraising is the planning stage. Make sure you figure out all the logistics of planning the event.\n\n\nAssign different tasks to different people. It can help to separate duties into categories and build teams from there. One group can responsible for managing money, another responsible for booking venues, and so on.\nDouble check all your information. Make sure you're following all regulations regarding fundraisers before engaging in the event. You do not want to host a successful event only to be slapped with a fine later on.\n A strong social media presence is key for successful fundraising. Get on Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and other social media outlets.\n\n\nAsk a social media savvy friend to help if you're not familiar with these outlets yourself. A strong Facebook fan page, as well as a Twitter presence, can be a great means to spread the word of an event to many people at once.\nReach out to the right people. Blindly inviting your entire Facebook friend's list is a big no-no. You're likely to annoy people who do not live in the area or who are not interested in the cause. Stick to inviting people who you know have similar views and live near enough to attend.\n People are more likely to donate if they know where their money is going. Know exactly where your money will be going and be upfront with people about this. If people know that, say, $5 buys one vaccination for a child in need in a third world country they'll be motivated to give., As you'll likely have to go through some auditing process for tax purposes, keep thorough records. Keep records of who donated, how much they donated, and what the money went towards.\n The key to getting people to donate is genuinely believing in your cause yourself. Know as much as you can about your cause so you sincerely believe it's worth it.\n\n\nIf you know a lot about your cause, you're likely to feel more passionate about it. When you send out an e-mail or letter asking for donations, you'll sound more convicted. This can motivate people to donate.People enjoy contributing to worthy causes. It makes them feel positive about themselves and involved in their community. The stronger you believe in your cause, the more others will want to help you out., The easier it is for passersby to donate to your cause, the more money you'll be likely to raise. Make it easy for potential donors to make a contribution. If you have a website set up to collect donations, ensure that it is easy to navigate. If you've set up an account at the local bank, make sure the instructions for making a deposit are clear.\n\n\nLow minimums for donations are more likely to make people feel like they can afford it.\n Each person that donates should receive a message from you or your organization, thanking them for their contribution and outlining what the money will be used for. Make the donor feel good about the money that they contributed. Thanking your donor also makes it easier to get in contact again when you run another fundraiser.\n\n\nFor large organizations, its expected that a thank-you message be sent out within 48 hours of the donation.\nFor personal fundraisers, you should be working to thank people as soon as they make their donation, and again after the fundraiser is complete.\n\n"}

Before you talk with a lawyer about the possibility of alimony, reading the statute will give you a solid basic understanding of your options., Under Florida state law, the court may grant alimony to either spouse during a divorce. There are four different categories of alimony and you and your lawyer should choose the type that best fits your situation.\n\n\n\"Bridge-the-gap\" alimony has been around in Florida since the 1970s. It is a short term cash award to one spouse with the intent to speed the transition from marriage back to being single. An example of bridge-the-gap alimony are monthly payments while the transitioning spouse establishes a household and finds a job. This type of alimony may not last longer than two years and is not subject to modification or revocation.Rehabilitative alimony will only be awarded when the requesting spouse provides a valid plan to transition from being married to a fully self-supporting single person. Rehabilitation plans usually include education and job training. Failure to stick to the plan can result in the loss of alimony.Durational alimony is a statutory creation that went into effect in 2010. The new law recognizes that alimony may be appropriate even in shorter marriages, those under 7 years, or moderate marriages, under 17 years. The judge must still take the traditional factors into account, such as age, education, job skills, child care, and earning capacity. However, durational alimony is legally capped at the length of the marriage.Permanent alimony is as the name suggests. Based on the standard factors, the judge can award alimony that lasts until one of the spouses dies or the receiving party remarries. Permanent alimony is intended for long marriages of over 17 years where any type of shorter alimony would be manifestly unfair. Permanent alimony is subject to court modification if there is a significant change in the circumstances or earning capacity of either party., A grant of alimony is not automatic, even in a fault-based divorce. The court uses a multi-factor test to determine the amount and duration of any alimony award and how it will be paid.\n\n\nThe length of the marriage and the standard of living during the marriage will strongly influence alimony. A spouse who makes significant contributions over a period of many years to help build a substantial standard of living will be more likely to reap the rewards through alimony. Child-rearing, maintaining a home, and contributing to the other spouse's financial success through entertaining, volunteer work, and helping pay for education are all relevant factors.\nThe court will look at each party's age, earning capacity, and physical and emotional health. Alimony can be used to achieve parity for a vulnerable spouse in a divorce.\nIndependent sources of income will also be considered. Even if vulnerable, a spouse who has inheritance or investments that are not marital property will be less likely to receive alimony. Overall property division will also be considered. The court can also decide to tip the equitable property division toward the more vulnerable spouse to accomplish fairness and parity., When you are speaking with an attorney, time is of the essence. In order for an attorney to be able to assess your case, she will need to know the basic facts about your marriage.\n\n\nHow long you've been married and the ages of your children.\nYour age, education, and job skills. Also your employment history and if you left a job in order to raise children or support your spouse's career.\nYour spouse's education and job history and earnings. Also list assets such as investments and retirement accounts.\nYou and your spouse's military history. Florida has a huge military population and emphasizing your support of a military spouse's career can help you build your case for alimony.\n The question of alimony is very complicated in Florida. Unless you have significant legal experience, it is unlikely that you will be able to handle a request for alimony on your own without legal assistance.\n\n\nThe Florida Bar Association has a referral service to help you connect with an attorney. For a fee of $20 to $50 you can meet with an attorney who handles your type of case for one-half hour. After that, if you like the lawyer, you can arrange for representation.If you feel comfortable talking about your situation, ask family and friends for referrals. You want to talk with someone who has a similar case and experience as yours.\nTelevision and print advertisements can be a starting place as well, but you must be careful to verify their skills and experience during your interview.\n Most attorneys will offer either a free consultation or a low fixed rate. During your consultation, you can assess the attorney's skills, experience, success rate, and familiarity with cases like yours.\n\n\nAlimony is very contentious in Florida. Ask the attorney about her experience and success with cases like yours. You also want an attorney who is skilled and comfortable with conducting trials over issues like alimony.\nAsk about costs. Divorce attorneys cannot take cases on a contingency basis or for a split of the property settlement or alimony. Family law cases are taken either on a flat fee or an hourly rate. If you like the lawyer, negotiate a fee arrangement that works for your budget. Rates will start at $100 per hour and go up from there.\nBefore you sign a retainer agreement, investigate the attorney's legal standing. The Florida Bar Association has a searchable database of disciplinary actions. You can verify that the attorney is in good standing and review any disciplinary actions.\n Most divorces in Florida are \"no-fault,\" meaning that neither side is accusing the other of wrong-doing and both agree that the marriage should be dissolved. However, the alimony statute, explicitly states that \"The court may consider the adultery of either spouse and the circumstances thereof in determining the amount of alimony, if any, to be awarded.\"If there has been adultery in the marriage by either party, it needs to be disclosed to your lawyer.\n\n\nAlimony will not be used as a punishment for a cheating spouse and does not automatically qualify or disqualify either you or your spouse from receiving or paying alimony. However, adultery will be considered as how it relates to assets. If one party depleted marital property or financial accounts in support of the affair, then alimony may be awarded as an equitable solution., In most courts, unless you ask for alimony during the initial divorce petition or counterclaim, you are waiving it and cannot ask at a later time.In some cases, the judge will find that alimony may be appropriate, but the other spouse is unable to pay at this time. Legitimate examples of this could include long military deployments, extended volunteer service, or recovering from an illness or injury. In other circumstances, the court may suspect a spouse is hiding assets or refusing to work. In these situations, the judge may award nominal alimony, for example, $1 per year. This reserves jurisdiction and allows the court to revisit the issue of alimony at a later date.Post-decree alimony is extremely rare. However, if you are divorced and believe your spouse committed fraud or coercion to avoid paying alimony, then you need to consult with an attorney who has specific experience in this type of law.\n Florida allows alimony to be paid periodically, usually monthly or quarterly, or in a single lump sum. Alimony is taxable income in all states.You should consult with your attorney and a tax professional to determine how to structure the payment schedule to minimize the tax consequences.\n\n\nIf you do not have children or are not receiving child support, Florida law states that alimony payments can be made directly and not through the state depository. If you are receiving child support payments, using the state depository is optional.\nOne advantage of using the state depository program is that if your ex falls behind in payments, you can apply to the state for assistance with collecting the back payments.\n At the early stages of your divorce, you don't know what could be the deciding factors in receiving alimony. You need to have good documentation in the form of records, receipts, or a detailed narrative of your contributions to the marriage and opportunities that you gave up to support your spouse. If possible, begin gathering documents and planning your strategy at least six months before initiating the divorce.Examples of lost opportunities include quitting school to raise children, giving up a job or promotion to move with your spouse, or working extra jobs to finance your spouse's education.\n Before your divorce, your attorney needs to know everything, good and bad, about your marriage. Relevant factors include adultery by either spouse, domestic violence, all assets, and if your spouse might be open to a settlement.\n\n\nDo not, under any circumstances, make false allegations about domestic violence or child abuse. This approach is likely to backfire. Ramifications could include loss of custody, denial of spousal support, and a citation for contempt of court., Permanent alimony is becoming less popular in Florida. Rehabilitative or bridge alimony is more common. To receive rehabilitative alimony, you must present a reasonable plan to the court. The most common plans are attending school to complete a degree or job training. However, if you submit this plan, you must be prepared to follow through with it or your ex-spouse can take you back to court and ask that it be cancelled.\n\n\nIf you have children and plan on returning to school, you can stretch your alimony award by asking that childcare expenses be factored into child support payments.Your alimony request must also be in line with the earning capacity of your spouse and the marital assets. The judge will deny an unreasonable request. Online calculators can help you estimate what you might receive in alimony., If you were denied alimony or received an award that you believe is too low, you can appeal the judge's decision to a higher court.The fee to file a case to Florida's Fourth District Court of Appeal is $300 and must be filed within 30 days of the judge's final decision. Appeals can be very complicated should only be approached after consultation with an attorney. This assistance will usually not be included in the fee agreement you made with your lawyer.Disagreeing with the judge's decision is not grounds for appeal. You will have to be able to show specific times during your divorce procedure where the judge clearly abused his discretion and failed to apply the correct law to your factual situation., If you believe you will have trouble getting your spouse to pay alimony, you may be able to \"trade\" your rights to alimony for a better share of the marital assets. Discuss your options with your attorney to determine the best choice for your situation.\n\n"}

Rub a clean finger over your baby's gums. If you're not comfortable using your finger, you can also use a moistened gauze pad., Keeping your baby's mouth cool can relieve some of the pain of teething. You can use a variety of cool substances to cool off your baby's gums and mouth.\n\n\nYou can use a cold wash cloth, a cold spoon, or a slightly chilled teething ring to help your baby feel better.While cold substances can help, anything frozen can be bad for your baby's health. Contact with extremely cold temperatures can be harmful to the mouth and gums. Use your refrigerator instead of your freezer when cooling off silverware or teething rings., You can purchase a teething device online or at a local drug store. Teething devices can be traditional teething rings, which are small plastic devices babies can chew on when their gums are bothering them. You can also buy teething blankets, which can be more convenient. Some teething devices vibrate to massage the gums and add extra relief., If your baby is old enough to eat solid foods, harder foods can help. Your baby can chew or gnaw on harder food items, such as peeled cucumbers or carrots or teething biscuits, and the pressure can provide pain relief.Keep a close eye on your baby if you give him hard foods, or place the hard foods in a mesh feeding bag approved for this use. You want to make sure he does not choke., Babies tend to drool a lot when teething. If excessive drool dries on your baby's mouth, it can cause skin irritation. Make sure to wipe off any drool you see with a clean towel.A water or cream-based lotion can be applied around your baby's mouth. This can also help prevent her skin from drying out due to drool.In the event a drooling rash does occur, place a cloth under the bed sheet while she sleeps. You should also rub some baby lotion or ointment around her mouth and cheeks before bed.If drooling is a common problem, consider a bib to catch drool as it falls.\n If home remedies aren't helping, there are a variety of over-the-counter medications designed for use on teething babies. Consider giving your baby painkillers if his teething is really bothering him.\n\n\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Children's Motrin) can be helpful for a teething baby. It might be a good idea to run this by your baby's doctor first to ask about dosage and any safety precautions you should take.Do not give ibuprofen to babies under 6 months of age.\nAvoid any medications that contain benzocaine, a common pain reliever. In rare cases, this can cause a serious condition that reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood.You should have your baby evaluated by a doctor before administering any medication if teething is severe. You want to make sure the pain is caused by teething and not an undetected underlying condition, like an ear infection., You can buy teething gels at a local pharmacy or supermarket if your baby does not respond to other treatments. Gels usually contain a local antiseptic or anesthetic. Use a sugar-free gel specifically recommended for babies. Gels usually wash away with a baby's saliva, so the effects might not last long. Talk to your doctor before using any gels.Avoid teething gels with benzocaine and make sure not to use teething gels more than recommended.\n Many parents use homeopathic methods to treat teething. While some of these methods may be relatively harmless, there is little scientific evidence to back up claims of effectiveness. Certain types of homeopathic methods may be harmful to your baby.\n\n\nHomeopathic powders or granules, sold by many pharmacies, are relatively harmless as long as they're sugar-free. However, most evidence regarding their effectiveness is anecdotal. If your baby is not responding to other treatments, you may want to try such powders but know there is no guarantee they will work.Some stores sell amber bracelets or necklaces which supposedly aid with teething pain by releasing a small amount of oil into the baby's skin. You should take extreme caution if you decide to try this method. Bracelets and necklaces both carry a choking risk for a small child. Babies may also suck or chew on such devices, and dislodged beads also carry a choking risk. There is no scientific evidence that shows amber is effective during teething pain., Teething is usually a normal part of a baby's growth and development. It can be handled at home without a doctor's assistance. However, if your baby develops a fever or seems particularly uncomfortable, she may have developed an infection or illness. Make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible., When your baby's first tooth arrives, he should see a dentist. Make an appointment no more than 6 months after the first tooth develops but before your baby's 1st birthday. Your dentist will check to make sure the baby's teeth are coming in healthy and strong., As your baby's teeth come in, take efforts to care for them. Healthy teeth and gums are important for your baby's overall health.\n\n\nWash your baby's gums with a clean, damp washcloth each day. This will prevent bacteria from building up.Switch to a soft-bristled toothbrush as your baby's first teeth begin to appear. Your child will not learn to spit until the age of three. Before this, use only a small bit of fluoride toothpaste that is approved for babies or children. It should be no bigger than a grain of rice., As your baby begins to transition to eating solid foods, provide her with healthy, low-sugar options. Always brush your baby's teeth after she eats. Minimize feeding her milk during the night and avoid letting her suck on a bottle at night or putting juice or other sugared drinks in a bottle."}

An algorithmic re-pricer like Feedvisor should do the trick.;\n,\n\n\u00a0 Seller rating is a crucial factor in winning the Buy Box. Sellers should aim for a seller rating of no less than 80%, ideally 90%. You can accomplish this by having outstanding customer service. You need to respond promptly and positively to comments and queries within 12-24 hours of them being left on your account page. Send satisfied customers a request to leave a positive review or a high feedback score.\u00a0 If you still get left a negative feedback, message them privately and ask what you can do that would sway them to remove it. Worse comes to worst and a customer absolutely refuses to budge, leave a respectful comment on the feedback explaining to other readers that you offered to set things right.,\u00a0Items fulfilled by Amazon get a perfect rating for response time, delivery time, and other seller metrics. So FBA items have a much better chance of winning the Buy Box. If it makes sense for you to use FBA, do so.\n The Buy box does not go to sellers who run out of the item they are selling. \u00a0Make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to you.\n The faster you can deliver the item, the more Amazon will favor your product.

Basically, the less we depend on fossil fuels, the better!\n\n, If you have access to some land, maybe you can Practice Sustainable Agriculture. If all you have is a balcony, you can still grow things like beans and peas, tomatoes, and herbs in pots. And if all you have is a window, become a guerilla gardener: find a patch of dirt anywhere in your neighborhood and plant stuff there. Whatever you can't grow, support your local farmers and buy it at a farmers' market.\n Consider whether you can Live Without a Car. At first, you might think it's impossible, but there are so many other ways to get around these days. If you can't part with your car, consider buying a hybrid, using biodiesel, and hypermiling.

You'd be surprised what you can do with old Altoids tins, socks, plastic bags, plastic bottles, and, well, everything.\n You can certainly be green without wearing green. The first rule is to never throw clothing away; always donate it to a charitable organization so it can be reused by someone else. But before you even part with a garment, try to think of ways you can revamp it and give it a little extra mileage. There are more than 20 ways you can give a t-shirt a makeover.

One reason people struggle to work out in the winter is that their exercise of choice isn't an option in the colder months. If you, for example, love running, you may struggle to do so in below freezing temperatures. Try to find a new activity that you enjoy.Take this as a chance to experiment a little. You want to diversify your workout routine, and winter is a chance to do so. Take a chance at trying a variety of new activities.\nFor example, try skiing if you've never tried it before. If you prefer to stay warm in doors, take a class at your local gym. Try a dance-based exercise class, for example.;\n, Weather is often the reason people taper off working out during the winter. Therefore, find something you enjoy that you can do indoors. There are a variety of workout routines you don't need to leave your home to do.Try enrolling in a class at your gym or at a local community center. You can try something like tai-chi, yoga, or Pilates.\nIf you love doing something like biking or running, try using a treadmill or stationary bike at your gym. If you go for long walks during the warmer months, try walking at a local mall during the winter.\n Many people enjoy playing outdoors in the winter. Certain activities can actually burn calories. If it's too cold to make it to your gym on any given day, try going outside and enjoying the weather as a form of working out.You can do things like make snowmen, make snow angels, go snowshoeing, or other winter activities.\nIf you have kids, try spending a day in the snow with your children instead of going to your gym if it's very cold out.\n If you don't like working out indoors, take winter as a chance to try winter sports. Things like skiing, snowshoeing, and even running outside are all options. See winter as a way to force yourself to try new things.You can see if there are classes for winter sports in your area. Taking a skiing class can be a fun way to stay active over the winter.\n Sticking to a workout routine requires goals. You can see winter as the beginning of another season. Just as you may set a weight loss or fitness goal for the new year, set some goals for winter.The best goals are reasonable and specific. If your goals are vague or over-the-top, you're likely to get frustrated and not stick to them.\nFor example, you may have a goal along the lines of, \"I want to lose some weight before the new year.\" This is an acceptable goal, but it's a little vague. Try to specify. For example, \"I want to lose 8 pounds by New Year's Eve.\"\n\n, Finding a workout buddy can help you stick to a routine. You will have another person to keep you accountable. Try pairing up with a friend to go skiing three times a week, or agreeing to go for a winter hike with your spouse each weekend.It's a good idea to pick a very motivated workout buddy. This way, their enthusiasm will rub off on you.\nIf you can't find a workout buddy in person, try finding an online workout partner.\n Working out can be tiring and stressful. Many people make excuses as to why they can't complete a routine. This can be particularly easy to do in the winter, when the weather gives you an easy out. Make a habit of recognizing and challenging your own excuses.Remind yourself that your health and fitness does not take a vacation. Even though it's winter, your body still needs a routine.\nRecognize when you're making an excuse and challenge it. For example, you may think something like, \"It's so cold. I can't walk to the gym in this weather.\" Counter this excuse with something like, \"I can wear layers and, even though the walk will be rough, I can make it to the gym.\"\n\n, Sometimes, things do happen. A snow day could leave your gym closed. Very low temperatures could make a winter run dangerous. In these scenarios, have a Plan B.Say you usually go to a gym. Have a few at-home workout routines on hand in case the weather closes your gym, or if it's too dangerous to drive. You can even get some small home workout equipment, like free weights, to use at home.\nYou can also find guided exercise routines to follow online. There may be a YouTube video, for example, of a half hour aerobics routine you could follow.\nSay you generally go running outside, even in the winter. If it gets too cold to run outside, you can run on a treadmill instead.\n Try to get excited about working out over the winter. Instead of viewing it as a burden, remember everything you're gaining. You are keeping your health and weight intact even when it's cold outside.Also, look into the fun things about working out in the winter. You can have a cup of warm cocoa in front of the fireplace after a vigorous workout, for example.\n You should always warm up before a workout, but this is especially important during the winter. A 10 minute warm up prior to a workout is important. Warming up usually means doing a less strenuous form of your chosen exercise first. For example, walk briskly for 10 minutes before running., You want to make sure you stay warm when working out outside in the winter. Layering is the best way to assure you're warm without having an outfit that inhibits your movement.Use a synthetic material for your first layer so that it will absorb sweat. Then, cover with layers of wool and fleece. Top off your layers with something waterproof.\nAvoid cotton. This gets wet easily, and you want to make sure you don't get too sweaty when working out in the winter.\n You will need to seek help fast in the event of frostbite and hypothermia. You should get out of the cold if you notice either and seek medical care if necessary.Frostbite usually occurs on exposed skin. You may feel numb or experience a stinging sensation. You should warm up the frostbitten area without rubbing it, as this can hurt the skin. If normal feeling does not return, see a doctor.\nLoss of coordination, slurred speech, fatigue, and intense shivering are signs of hypothermia. Go to the emergency room if you notice any signs.\n You may not feel the need to drink much water, or wear sunscreen, during colder months. However, you still need protection from the sun even if it's cold out. You also may not feel thirsty if it's cold outside, but you still need to hydrate as you lose fluids when working out.Even if you don't feel thirsty, drink water. Carry a water bottle with you and takes sips on occasion when working out.\nCover most of your skin to avoid too much sun exposure.

Take some time to reflect on your current relationships. Is there someone who is constantly bringing you down?For instance, think about your relationship with your parents. Do you feel insecure because they constantly put you down?\nOr maybe your issues stem from work. Do you have a coworker who refuses to recognize your contributions to the team?\n\n, If you find that there are negative people in your life, look for ways to limit your contact with them. If you are around positive people, you are more likely to feel secure. If your brother is part of the problem, try to limit contact with him and focus on the family members who are supportive. You can tell your Mom, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t make the family picnic next Saturday. But I\u2019d love to spend some one on one time with you. Can I take you to dinner next week?\u201d\n\n, Relationships that are positive will make you feel good about yourself. In order to strengthen your relationships, communicate your needs to others. These can be emotional or logistical needs.For example, you might say to your sister, \"I need you to support me in my efforts to get in shape. Can you be a positive workout buddy for me?\"\nMaybe it makes you feel bad when your husband is always late for date night. Try saying, \"Sam, can you try to be on time for dinner Thursday? I want to feel like date night is a priority for you.\"\n\n, It can be really helpful to create a barrier between yourself and the people or situations that make you feel insecure. Defining boundaries is a great way to make sure you have the emotional space that you need. Make a list of lines that you would like to draw.For example, if your dad causes you some anxiety you could set this boundary: \"Instead of meeting Dad for dinner, I will meet him for a brief coffee break. That way, I can set a clear time limit.\"\nMaybe you are insecure about your dancing skills. Make a deal with yourself: attend your friend's wedding, but come up with a gracious way to decline invitations to hit the dance floor.\n\n"}

If you put too many slices of pizza in the pan at once, the crust won\u2019t crisp evenly.\nIf you want a crunchier finish, melt half a tablespoon of butter in the pan before heating up the pizza. This will add a buttery, deliciously flaky finish to the bottom crust., If you use a waffle iron to reheat your pizza, you can skip the microwave and oven entirely. First rearrange the toppings on the pizza. They should be clustered together in the upper left corner of the pizza slice near the crust. Then, fold the pizza. Bring the bottom point up to the top left corner and press the pizza to make a fold. Finally, press your pizza into a pre-heated waffle iron and cook for about five minutes, continually checking for doneness.If you have small pizza pieces or a large waffle iron you don\u2019t need to fold the pizza or rearrange the toppings. Instead, sandwich two pizza pieces together and press them in the waffle iron.\n Fresh ingredients such as basil leaves and sliced mozzarella are excellent additions to any pizza.

Moreover, a child instilled with a love of learning for its own sake in the home environment will thrive regardless of the teaching, as there will be more self-responsibility and less tendency to pass the responsibility elsewhere.\n\n\nThere is no such thing as a perfect teacher. Every person has strengths in different areas. All teachers have something to offer in some way, so it pays to help your child learn how to make the most of the teachers' best skills. After all, in life, this is an essential skill, particularly for persons in a role of delegating or advising others on working together; no harm in starting to learn this skill early.;\n, Establishing a social connection with a teacher creates a sense of responsibility for the child to complete school activities. It also gives them the confidence to ask the teacher for help when they fail to understand something.\n\n\nNot all children find speaking up in class time easy. It is just as important to find other ways for the quiet child to gain the teacher's attention, such as talking to the teacher during a quiet time, after class or even by email. Quietness is not a sign of a lack of interest; it is often a sign that the child is processing but needs time to fully digest. Sometimes being pressured to ask questions can interfere with that reflection process and place undue stress on the child. If your child is inclined to be quiet, avoid badgering them into asking questions openly but help them to find constructive ways to get the teacher's attention.\n Exposure to multiple learning sources can increase a child's learning capacity to a great extent. This means learning subjects using visual, literary and acoustic aids from the internet and books. This includes diagrams, watching educational videos and listening to lectures. A combination of these resources will increase the learner's interest and give school subjects a holistic approach, making learning easier and more interesting, as well as relevant.\n Children function better in stress-free environments, so any domestic upheavals can affect their concentration and cause their focus to stray. Of course, no home is perfect and things happen. Be realistic and accept that some exposure to life's uncertainties is as much a lesson about life as aiming to run a perfect household. What does matter is that the children know that they matter, that they can come to you for help and clarification and that the bad times are temporary and soon roll back to an even keel.\n\n\nIf you are going through financial, relationship, work or other hardships, ensure that the children have stability of some sort so that the studies come first and they are aware that you expect this, no matter what else. It may be a quiet study area away from parental stressing, or occasional trips away for the whole family to relax away from the source of challenges. In other words, times of hardship can't be simply wished away but you can provide workarounds to help your children to feel less stressed by the adult issues confronting the household. Shielding them completely is both impossible and unhealthy\u2013\u2013children learn by example how to cope with hardship just as much as they learn how to cope with the good times.\n Good time management is essential. An outline of how to spend the day should be made by children and slightly moderated by the parents, in order to ensure that it is effective.\n This must account for sports practice, activities, hobbies and leisure time too.\n Before children take examinations, they need to work with past year papers and exercises to familiarize with the questions. Sometimes, it is not that children do not know their work, rather they do not know what the question requires of them.\n This is essential for good focus. Taking nutritional supplements, especially to counter our unhealthy modern diets, is essential to improve focus.\n The age- old \"pay attention in class\" as well as punctuality is a valuable way to improve comprehension of lessons and get exam tips from teachers.\n Physical activity is essential for stress relief. Children should also try studying in serene settings.\n Parents need to be active in children's studying. Parents need to share their own studying experiences with children or enroll them in a study group to increase interest.\n Children need to be motivated to study. Sometimes, interest is hard to generate, so they need to be physically rewarded as well.\n\n"}

If you do see matrimony as a possibility, then you will have to handle matters gently to avoid causing lasting hurt feelings.\n\n\nThis is a matter for some introspection. Try not to make a hasty or ill-considered decision, because there are likely to be far-reaching consequences for your relationship no matter what you do.\nThink about what constitutes a healthy marriage, and what your motivations for saying \u201cyes\u201d would be. Marriage probably won\u2019t save a struggling relationship, but it can enrich a healthy one.\n Kindness, sensitivity, and honesty will go a long way in making your refusal less painful to them.\n\n\nTell them your answer in person, if possible. It\u2019s only fair.\nIf you or they are too emotional for an in-person refusal, then a telephone conversation or a hand-written letter are the next best options. You should not use a highly impersonal method like text messaging to turn them down.\n It may result in some hurt feelings, but you can overcome those with time, and if they truly love you, giving you a little time will not change that fact.How long you wait depends entirely on you and your partner. You do not want to rush a decision on marriage if you aren\u2019t sure, but on the other hand you owe your partner a definitive answer at some point.\nHave some empathy for your partner as you consider things. They are likely waiting on pins and needles for your answer, and ultimately marriage is a cooperative venture. Keep them foremost in your mind as you think about what to do. When you\u2019re ready, break the news to them without delay.\n Not every relationship has matrimony as the goal, and declining a proposal does not necessarily spell doom for everyone. Plenty of people create long-lasting, satisfying partnerships without formally getting married.\n\n\nJust because you aren\u2019t ready to tie the knot today doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll never want to do it. Explain to your partner that you\u2019re not ready for that step just yet.\nIf you never want to get married, you need to tell your partner. They may be fine with it, they may not, but you owe it to them to be honest., If you decline the proposal, it is your obligation to keep the news to yourself. Politeness dictates that you should spare your partner the potential embarrassment and humiliation of others bringing up their rejection.If you want to tell someone about it, the right thing to do is to ask your partner if they mind first.\nOnly tell people you trust not to spread the story around.

The goal is to work the muscles in ways that will maximize their ability to generate power over extended periods as well as to work stabilizer muscles that are under-trained in most runners. 3 sets of 8-10 works the body past pure power lifting (creating phosphate energy), but remains within the range for maximum strength benefits. Lifting helps extend the potential to increase power, which increases potential stride length, and thus the potential to run faster, especially if lean muscle mass and not bulk is added. Replace every 4th lifting day with plyometrics to ensure maximal conversion of strength training to explosiveness and fast running.\n\n\nEmphasis needs to be placed on abductor/adductor exercises to help prevent injuries from overpronation and knee tracking issues (i.e. imbalances causing the knee to not glide on the patellar joint and instead irritate the cartilage), including but not limited to IT band syndrome, shin splints, tendinitis, etc.\nExample Schedule: Day 1=Squats, Abductor, Adductor, Calve raises. Day 2= Lunges, Leg Extension, Leg Curl. Make sure to include core, including back extensions and abdominal crunches as well as some chest and shoulder exercises to assist with form.\nOther lifts that should be included focus on the lower back and hip flexors, muscles that are often ignored. Deadlifts, Split-Squats, Glute-Ham Raise, Straight Leg Extensions, and barbell step-ups onto a knee high platform are great ways to develop strength in these muscles.\nLifting sessions should be less than one hour. To do this, utilize circuit type training approaches (i.e. while taking rest from squats, do pull-ups).\nRecovery should include a protein/carbohydrate snack within one hour to maximize anabolism (protein assists in the ingestion of carbohydrate. A balanced diet should contain enough protein, so protein shakes are unnecessary - the body can produce a majority of amino acids). A nice glass of chocolate milk is ideal.\nA non-lifting way to achieve the same objectives is to incorporate soccer or Frisbee or basketball once a week to help work on stabilizer muscles, explosiveness, and reinforce turnover. Football players rarely have an issue with over striding or slow turnover for a reason.;\n, The anaerobic system can reach 95% of its potential training for 6 weeks. Therefore, the only training that should be done in the summer should focus on aerobic conditioning and strength training. This can either be a cross country training program, or can be something consisting of the following:\n\n\nOne long run per week to build up oxidative enzymes (up to 15 miles (24\u00a0km), but no more than 1/4 of weekly mileage), 2 days of hill sprints including form drills (lead-yard bounding is recommended, see images and search for Lydiard foundation), 2 days of lifting, and just plenty of mileage until you are up to at least 30 miles (48\u00a0km) per week.\nMileage is very important to most 800 runners. While elite sprint types can normally get away with 30-40 mpw, most elite 800 runners need to build base at 50 mpw up to 70-80 to maximize fitness and to consolidate aerobic gains.\nNote: Unless you have hit a mileage before, do not increase more than 10% or 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) in a given week. For example, For someone running 60 mpw, mileage by week coming off of a break would be 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 35, 45, 50, 53, 55, 50, 55, 58, 60. Note that as the mileage increases to near maximum, the increase in mileage per week slows and lower mileage weeks are built in for recovery. Most 800 runners have a need to taper mileage every third week by ~20-30% (i.e. w1=60, w2=60, w3=45, w4=60...) in order to prevent physical and mental burnout. Build this into your schedule!\n\n, After the mileage is built up, start including strides at the 800 meter date pace. For example, 12 x 100 @ 800 with 300 jog. This is to reinforce speed principles and build muscle memory/efficiency without straining and/or compromising aerobic conditioning. Also include 5K workouts (i.e. x mins @ 5K pace, x minutes recovery, where x starts at 2 and works up to 3-5 minutes for a maximum of 20-25 minutes). A great way to ensure that you are not overworking your athletes, but to keep hammering the different physiological systems is to do three week mini-cycles (i.e. in a 3 week span, you do 1 tempo runs, 1 day of cruise intervals, 2 days of 5K intervals, 1 day of 3K intervals, and 1 day of 200 meter hills, so 33% of the workouts are lactate threshold, 33% are VO2, and 33% are efficiency (At vVO2 or 1500/800 effort).\n\n\nThis can also be done at threshold pace for those focusing on XC (workout would be x mins @ slightly slower than 10K pace with 1 min recovery, starting at 2 minutes and working up to 6-10 minutes). Threshold pace is the pace at which a steady state of lactic acid is accumulated in the blood (~ 4 mM). Additional effort will cause a significant increase in lactic acid accumulation and will not improve your body's ability to buffer lactic acid and to clear it. Thus, it is an effort and not a pace.\nSample week: Sunday: 15 miles (24\u00a0km), Monday: 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) + 6 x Hills, Tuesday: 4 x 6 min @ T with one min jog, LIFT. Wednesday: OFF Thursday: 10 miles (16\u00a0km) + Hill Sprints. Friday: 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) + 12 x 100 @ 800, LIFT, Saturday: 8 miles (13\u00a0km) easy.\n Start including intervals @ 5K pace. Intervals can start @ 400's and work up to intervals that take between 3-5 minutes (for example, 6 x 1K @ 5K with equal time recovery). Distance running increases mitochondria, increases the number of capillaries, and increases stroke volume, decreasing heart rate (aka, the infrastructure). VO2 max training on the other hand increases the ability of the body to take oxygen, absorb it into the blood stream, and subsequently deliver it to muscles (think the cars using the infrastructure) while threshold training helps to eliminate byproducts of training (think maintenance crews). Thus, they are all important and all have their place. VO2 max workouts should replace the Friday workout, which can replace hill sprints one of the days or can move to Saturday. At this point, the runner should be in great aerobic fitness and strong, but not \"fast\". Downhill sprints or sprints that are wind assisted should be incorporated to reinforce turnover.\n Now it is time to concentrate on race specificity. Workouts should now be 3 days a week and can often work on a 14 day cycle (i.e. every 14 days includes 1 VO2 max workout (aka 5K pace), 1 threshold workout, 1 workout at vVO2 (aka 3K pace), 1 workout @ 1500 pace, and 2 workouts @ 800/400 pace). For example, work from 8 x 300 @ 1500 date pace to 5 x 600 @ 1500 date pace. Interval length should for the most part be no longer than half of the race and the total distance at this pace should be no more distance than 2.5 times race distance (at that point, if you can run that, it's not your race pace, or you are recovering too long!). You can also run race simulations (600 @ 800 or 400 @ 800, 1 min, 200 @ 800).\n\n\nMake SURE to keep up the work focusing on turnover, otherwise the 400 will suffer. Running the 4x4 at every indoor meet is a good way to turn a race into a full speed workout.\nTake days easy/off as necessary for races, but train through (i.e. don't take 3 days off to recover for a dual meet).\nLifting should cut back to one day per week to account for the increased intensity of workouts, but can be replaced by plyometrics (depth jumps, alternate leg step-up jumps on an appropriate bench, alternate leg bounds, straight legged jumps (calve workout), etc.).\n Now is the time to blast the anaerobic system. My favorite workout is 8-12 x 200 @ 800 meter date pace (pace you could run that day) with a 200 meter jog. This workout will give your body superior ability to buffer lactic acid, be relatively stress free mentally, and is just a good third workout. Running 4 x 400 at 800 meter date pace is a fantastic way to teach your body to run fast through fatigue. Practice running these date-pace type workouts with intervals both at \"first lap pace\" (i.e. goal pace - 2 seconds) and \"second lap pace\" (I.e goal pace + 2 seconds).\n\n\nLifting should be minimized and focus should be on form building plyometrics.\nFocus should be on longer intervals (i.e. 400's at 800 meter date pace) and should work towards goal pace (i.e. 5-6 x 300 at 800 meter goal pace with ample recovery).\nIncreased focus on training at 400 pace should also be included, as the 800 time is in part limited by speed endurance, i.e. how fast one can run the 400 (400 time x 2 + 12 seconds = rough ceiling).\n A taper should be a slight cut down on quantity, a slight increase in quality, and a few extra days easy before race. We are natural hunters and gatherers. Therefore, cutting back mileage excessively will cause your body to go into hibernation mode. A workout such as 200, 300, 300, 200 for goal pace race simulation is a great easy workout, followed by 6 x 150 @ 400 to reinforce speed and turnover. Again, do not cut your mileage by more than 20%, but thresholds and VO2 work should be minimized (i.e., no more than 10 minutes a week of efforts at these paces to reinforce maintenance of physiological adaptations).\n Take two weeks off to recuperate for the coming year.

They may work with people who are unable to communicate effectively or have special needs.Meet new people, find things you have in common and try to understand your differences. Put yourself in other people's shoes to understand what a person is feeling or why he choose certain actions.Challenge prejudices. We often have preconceived notions about groups of people. Focus on what you share with individuals instead of what divides you. Listen to people. The ability to focus on another person\u2019s emotional state and needs is an important skill for a neurosurgeon to have. Paraphrase what people say to you to show that you are an active listener and ensure you understand what they are saying. Consider learning another language. This is an extremely valuable skill. You will often encounter people who speak a different language. Speaking another (or multiple) language can help you easily communicate with these patients and can help you stand out when applying to med school.;\n, Learn to work well within a team and take on leadership roles. Physicians understand ethical principles and moral reasoning. They must make decisions about patient care and implement treatment plans., Learn how to collect information and research problems to find solutions. Explore areas you are unfamiliar with and use trusted sources of information to gain new knowledge.\n Neurosurgeons operate in and around the brain so they need to be able to understand spatial relationships and use their hands with skill. Visualize how things go together. Put together complex models with your hands. Learn how to collect information and research problems to find solutions. You will also need to be skilled and dexterous with your hands, as neurosurgery is delicate work. However, don't stress over this too much, as much of your manual dexterity will be acquired through experience. , Colleges look for students who can succeed in challenging and rigorous courses. These classes will also help you succeed in the demanding college courses required to get into medical school.\n Familiarize yourself with the way healthcare settings function, such as how physicians and staff interact. Watch how patients are treated and what physicians do. Shadow a doctor, preferably a neurologist or neurosurgeon if you can.\n Make sure to take courses that satisfy pre-medical school requirements. Many successful medical students major in biology but it is not a requirement for admission to medical school. Consider a major in neurobiology or neuroscience if these are offered.\n\n\nYour degree should include a core curriculum that consists of chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, calculus and physics courses with labs.\nTaking biochemistry, microbiology and human anatomy classes will increase your chances of getting into medical school and doing well there.\nA few medical schools offer combined undergraduate and medical school programs that last six or seven years. If this interests you, look into these programs.\n Medical school is very competitive. Strive for at least a 3.0 GPA, though a 3.5 or above is better. Your first-year biology grades are especially important. Some schools will disqualify students with Cs and lower. Try to earn at least a 3.75 GPA your freshman year of college.Spend time studying throughout the week to review material covered in class. Join a study group and go over important information with friends. Purchase, borrow or rent course reviews and quizzes. If you need help, get a tutor through your college or hire an independent instructor.\nThe higher you can get your grades, the better you will look to admissions committees. This will give you the best chance of getting into the college you want. GPA is also important to qualify for scholarships that will pay for college.\n This is another way to set yourself apart from other applicants. Participating in undergraduate research indicates that you are a curious and hardworking, and it may help you get additional recommendations and advocates from your mentors. Ask your professors if they are working on any research projects to which you might contribute, or if they have any colleagues that you could work with. In addition, look into research opportunities for undergraduates at medical clinics (such as the Cleveland Clinic)., You will need to submit letters of recommendations to get into medical school from professors or employers who are familiar with you and your work. Take on a research or teaching assistant position and take this opportunity to build a relationship with faculty members.\n This is a standardized examination required by all US medical schools and many in Canada. This test score is one of the most important factors for medical school admission. Give yourself adequate time to prepare for it.\n\n\nMany students take the MCAT during their junior year after studying for several months, while others prefer to finish four years of college before taking the MCAT. You might decide to take the test sooner if you have taken some advanced placement coursework or classes during the summer.The MCAT tests foundational concepts, scientific inquiry, critical analysis and reasoning skills drawn from biology, biochemistry, organic chemistry, general chemistry, physics, psychology and sociology. Do your best to be familiar with these disciplines and practice your reading analysis skills.\n The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) administers the MCAT throughout the year at hundreds of test sites throughout the US and Canada, along with other locations. Check with the AAMC for test dates and locations near you.Register early, at least 60 days in advance of the exam date, to get your preferred test date or location. You must pre-register online and pay a fee.\nEnter your information into the Scheduling and Registration System exactly as it appears on your identification (ID) and make sure your contact information is correct.\nIf you are unable to pay for the MCAT exam, you may be eligible for the Fee Assistance Program (FAP). You will need to submit an application and be approved before you register for the MCAT. , Arrive at least 30 minutes early with a government-issued ID. You can only bring yourself, your clothes and a watch into the test room. Lockers and locks are usually offered for your other personal items, such as a cell phone. Study hard before the test. Aim for a score of 32 or higher.Buy or rent an MCAT prep book or take a review course. You may also sign up for practice exams that prepare you for the real thing.If you don\u2019t get the score you want, you can retake the MCAT up to three times a year and seven times during your lifetime. Keep in mind, though, that different schools will treat multiple scores differently\u2014some may average them while others may take the most recent or best score., Medical schools can be very different and you will need to research each school to find the best medical schools for you. Factors to consider include location, cost, curriculum, facilities, financial aid, residency placement and reputation.\n This will increase your chances of getting accepted. If you select schools that take part in the Early Decision Program (EDP), then you may secure an acceptance early and still have time to apply to other schools if you are not accepted. Applicants usually submit transcripts, MCAT scores and letters of recommendation but schools may also consider personality, leadership qualities and participation in extracurricular activities. Most schools will require interviews with admissions committee members.\nYou will apply through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) and/or the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS) and the services will send your application to your desired schools. US medical schools that confer the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree use AMCAS as the primary application method for students whereas osteopathic medical schools that confer the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree use AACOMAS.\nIn the case of rejection, don\u2019t give up. Not everyone gets into the medical school of choice but with hard work and dedication you will get into a medical school.\nMost applicants to medical school have at least a bachelor's degree, but many have advanced degrees as well. If you have difficulty getting into medical school consider getting a master\u2019s degree or higher before applying again.\nIf you are selected to interview, study up on the school so you will be able to ask relevant questions. You may want to practice your interviewing skills before you meet with the school. A good impression will give you a good chance at being offered a position with the school.\n or D.O. degree You will attend medical school for four years. This time will be spent in laboratories and classrooms as well as gaining practical skills, such as taking medical histories and diagnosing patients under the supervision of experienced physicians.\n\n\nIdentify a resident and faculty mentor in neurosurgery as soon as possible. These mentors can help you put together your residency application and expose you to operating room and neurosurgery clinics.\nEnrolling in an elective during medical school can help you decide if being a neurosurgeon is right for you. If you are interested in neurosurgery, you should do sub-internships during the fourth year of medical school.\nYou can also gain neurosurgery exposure by attending the weekly didactic sessions and grand rounds at your school\u2019s neurosurgery residency program. You can learn more about neurosurgery and interact with faculty and residents at these sessions.\n You want to do well in medical school and make connections to get a good internship and residency placement later on. You will want to cultivate relationships and earn letters of recommendation.\n You should gain experience with research, preferably in the neuroscience and neurosurgical fields. Research participation will help you get to know faculty members, contribute to exciting advances in medicine and increase your chances of getting into the residency of your choice.\n\n\nLook into faculty members credentials, interests and the research they are involved in. Talk to them about potential openings for students to participate. Let them know you are interested and find out what you need to do to apply.\nPublishing in a peer-reviewed journal about your research will look excellent on your application to residency programs.\nThe summer after your first year of medical school may be an optimal time to begin researching and shadowing at this level.\nYou can also attend national conferences like the annual meeting of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons to make connections with residents and neurosurgeons from around the world.\n Toward the end of medical school, medical students interested in a career in neurosurgery will apply through the Neurosurgery Match Program. The program pairs applicants and neurosurgical programs.\n\n\nThere are around 100 neurosurgical residency programs in the US and each accepts about one to three residents. You will need to apply to more than one residency program to ensure that you get in, though odds are very good for candidates in neurosurgery.Plan for alternatives. Matching a residency in neurosurgery is extremely competitive, and there is a possibility you will not match. Ask yourself what you will do in this event. How can you improve your application? What can you do in the year before you can reapply \u2014 research, an internship, or something else? You may wish to consider applying for a general surgical position while also applying to neurosurgery positions. Talk to your advisors about what you might do to prepare for this possibility.\n Usually, you will do your internship at the same place as your neurosurgery residency program. This is your first year as a doctor, and you will learn how to manage patients, learn procedures, management decisions and basic operative techniques.\n During this time, you will spend the first two years as a junior resident managing ICU patients, doing consultations and basic to more complicated operations. As a mid-level resident, you may do a rotation at a children\u2019s hospital, elective time or research. Afterward, you will do one to two years of research or a fellowship in a sub-specialty before doing one year as chief resident with increasing responsibilities and performing complex operations.\n At the conclusion of your residency, you will study for and pass the certification examination administered by the American Board of Neurological Surgery (ABNS). Most states require physicians to have this certification to get a license. There may also be other state requirements, so check with your state.\n In the US, surgeons must pass a standardized national licensure examination. M.D.s take the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and DOs take the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX). By gaining licensure, you can practice as a neurosurgeon. Candidates must graduate from an accredited medical school, complete one year of residency training in their specialty and pass written and practical exams in order to qualify for a license.\n You may want to specialize in a particular area of neurosurgery after residency. These include pediatric, spinal, vascular/endovascular, tumor, peripheral nerve, functional or skull base. To do this, you must undertake a fellowship under the supervision of a qualified specialist and then obtain state certification.\n Apply for open neurosurgeon positions at the hospital or clinic of your choice. Consult with relevant attorneys and business advisors about opening your practice.\n\n\nTo open your own practice, first secure financing and a location. You may get loans through local or commercial banks. You could also try a lending company as well as philanthropists or those looking for an investment opportunity. Look for a suitable office space that is accessible. Procure computers, software and medical equipment to help your practice run smoothly.\nYou will need to hire staff members, such as other physicians, nurses, medical assistants, office managers and administrative assistants.\nGet credentialed with major insurance companies to begin accepting new patients. This process with the health insurance companies can take several months. Find medical malpractice insurance. Look for reasonable rates and coverage.\nBring in patients through advertisements, online reviews, word of mouth, etc. and start practicing.\n This may include annual meetings, conferences, scientific journals and research. You need to be up to date with rapidly advancing neurosurgeon research and technology.\n\n"}

This is a chronic disease which is mediated by Immunoglobulin G antibody or IgG. Immunoglobulin G is thought to react in the skin in such a way as to break intercellular junctions of the epidermis and in particular that of keratinocytes. This leads in turn to separation of these cells from each other, a process which is called acantholysis. This in turn leads to the formation of vesicles that contain keratinocytes. There are accompanying to this disease several systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss. This is a potentially life threatening disorder that can lead to death if left untreated. Treatment of this disorder includes the administration of drugs that suppress the action of the immune system such as steroids. If you suspect this is the disorder you are identifying, try to make sure the person receives medical attention as quickly as possible.;\n, It differs than pemphigus vulgaris in that it usually affects persons between the ages of 60 and 80. It differs than pemphigus vulgaris also by the lack of oral lesions. It is however, similar to pemphigus vulgaris in that it is mediated by the action of immunoglobulin G also. It is thought to deposit in the skin basement membrane. This causes the basal cells to detach from the dermal layer of the skin. This in turn leads to the formation of subcutaneous vesicles which contain predominantly white blood cells.\n This disease is common between the ages of 20 to 40 years. This disorder has strong association with gluten induced enteritis or celiac disease. In spite of the apparent link between the two disorders removal of gluten from the diet does not improve the dermatitis. It is mediated by the action of immunoglobulin A instead of immunoglobulin G. Clinically speaking, this is a chronic disease with relapses and remission. The treatment to this condition is also by suppression of the overactive immune system with steroids.\n Skin pathology in this condition can arise as a separate condition or accompanied by other organs in the body. The isolated skin disorder is called discoid lupus erythematosus while that involves other organs is called systemic lupus erythematosus. They differ by the fact that systemic lupus erythematosus has a deposition of immunoglobulin G in the basement membrane of the skin of both diseased and healthy skin, while discoid lupus erythematosus is manifested by deposition of IgG in the affected area only.\n\n\n\nPsoriasis. This disorder is as was mentioned idiopathic in which its cause is unknown. The disease is common and affects approximately 1% of the total population. It has a chronic course with remissions and exacerbations. Often the nails of affected persons are involved. The disorder is manifested by the excessive formation of keratinocytes in the basal layer of the skin. This leads in turn to more formation of keratin and its deposition in the epidermis. This disorder is sometimes linked to joint diseases that are similar to rheumatoid arthritis.\nLichen planus. This disorder has a chronic course in which women are more affected than men. This disorder is manifested by a decrease in cell proliferation. This leads in turn to more keratin formation with hyperkeratosis.\nErythema multiforme. This disorder is a common disease and can affect people with any age. It is associated with many disorders such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n\n"}

There are some steps you can take to reduce your chances of developing vaginitis.\n\n\nDo not douche. Douching changes the pH of the environment in the vagina and increases the risk of a bacterial infection.\nLimit yourself to one sexual partner. Those with multiple sexual partners are at a higher risk of developing bacterial vaginosis.\nDo not smoke. Smoking is associated with increased risk of developing a bacterial infection in the vagina.\n Bacterial infections in the throat are called pharyngitis. This refers to the inflammation and infection of the pharynx, or the back of the throat. There are specific strategies you can take to reduce the potential that you will get a throat infection.Wash your hands after you\u2019ve been in public or have been around anyone who has an upper respiratory condition.\nWash your hands after blowing your own nose or caring for a child with a runny nose and/or sore throat.\nDo not share eating or drinking utensils with children or with an adult who appears to have a throat infection or a sore throat. Keep a sick person\u2019s utensils separate from the rest and wash them thoroughly with hot, soapy water.\nWash any toys that a toddler with pharyngitis has been playing with. Use hot soapy water, rinse well, and then dry thoroughly.\nDispose of any used tissues right away.\nAvoid kissing or sharing eating utensils with someone who has the flu, a cold, mononucleosis, or a known bacterial infection.Do not smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.Use a humidifier if the air in your home is dry.Keeping your neck warm with a scarf during colder months can also protect you by keeping a body temperature that is less hospitable to bacterial and viral growth.\n Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs which can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. This infection is very serious and can cause death. Some groups of people are at higher risk of developing pneumonia and should practice preventative measures carefully.Take extra precautions if you:\n\n\nSmoke cigarettes or use other tobacco products\nHave recently had a respiratory infection such as the flu, a cold, or laryngitis\nHave a medical condition which impairs your ability to swallow, such as a stroke, dementia, or Parkinson\u2019s disease\nSuffer from chronic lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, or bronchiectasis\nHave other serious medical conditions such as heart disease, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes\nHave recently had surgery or a physical trauma\nHave a weakened immune system from an underlying medical condition or certain medications\n\n, If you are at risk of developing pneumonia, you should do everything that you can to protect yourself. Preventative measures for pneumonia include:Getting a flu shot every year\nGetting vaccinated against pneumococcal pneumonia if you are an at risk adult\nDiscontinuing your use of tobacco products, especially cigarettes\nWashing your hands after blowing your nose, going to the bathroom, caring for others who are sick, or before eating or preparing foods\nKeeping your hands away from your face and nose.\nAspiration pneumonia can occur when food or liquids are swallowed down the wrong pipe. Avoid eating in the prone position, or feeding someone who is not sitting upright.\nTaking care of your own general health, since pneumonia can follow other respiratory infections\n\n, Children are more likely to suffer from internal ear infections, which are painful and can lead to other health problems. You may be able to reduce your child\u2019s chances of getting a middle ear infection by following some simple suggestions.Do not smoke in your home or around children. Ear infections are more common in children who are exposed to secondhand smoke.\nIf possible, breastfeed your children when they are infants. Breast feeding helps develop a stronger immune system, which reduces the risk of ear infections.\nNever let your baby drink from a bottle while he or she is lying down. Because of the structure of the ears and tube which drains the middle ear, lying down while drinking significantly increases the risk of an ear infection.\nReduce your child\u2019s exposure to other children who are sick. Keep your child\u2019s hands clean and washed, as children often enjoy putting their hands in their mouths.\n Swimmer\u2019s ear is an infection in the outer ear canal triggered by water remaining in the outer ear which creates a warm, moist environment for bacterial growth. This is also known as acute external otitis or otitis externa.To reduce your chances of developing swimmer\u2019s ear:\n\n\nKeep your ears dry after swimming and bathing.\nDry your outer ear with a soft towel or cloth. Tip your head to one side and then the other to assist water to drain out.\nDry the ear canal with a hair dryer on the lowest setting and holding it at least one foot from your head.\nDo not put foreign objects in the ear such as cotton swabs, paper clips, or hairpins.\nPut cotton balls in your ears when you apply irritating products such as hair sprays and hair dyes.\n Bacterial infections can also affect your brain. Between 2003-2007, there were 4,100 cases of bacterial meningitis each year, including 500 deaths.Antibiotic treatments improve survival rates, lowering the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, but prevention with vaccination works best.Take the following steps to help reduce your risk of contracting bacterial meningitis:\n\n\nWash your hands often.\nDo not share drinks, eating utensils, lip balms, or toothbrushes with anyone.\nMaintain a good immune system by getting at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night, drinking at least 64 ounces of water each day, getting 30 minutes of exercise each day, taking a multivitamin and eating a well-balanced diet.\nConsider getting vaccinated against bacterial meningitis. Some forms of bacterial meningitis are preventable with vaccinations. Ask your doctor about getting vaccinated to help protect yourself.\nBacterial meningitis can be spread through airborne droplets, so if you know anyone who has bacterial meningitis, it is best to avoid close contact, and to wear a face mask.\n Septicemia or sepsis is uncontrolled bacterial infection blood. When bacteria is growing in the blood it can also infect other organ systems in the body, such as the kidneys, pancreas, liver, and spleen.Different types of infections can lead to sepsis, such as those on the skin, lungs, urinary tract, and abdomen, or it can be a primary infection in the blood.\nSome people are at higher risk of developing sepsis, including people who have a weakened immune system, infants and children, elderly people, those with a chronic illness such as diabetes, cancer, liver disease or HIV/AIDS, and people who have suffered from a severe physical trauma or severe burn.

Develop a routine that leaves you feeling squeaky clean and smelling great. Remember to always scrub areas such as elbows , necks and knees due to the bacteria you bring home each day. The bacteria will cause your elbows to turn darker if you have a pale skintone.\n\n\nShower daily. Pick out a body soap that appeals to you and scrub down! Don't feel obligated to wash your hair every day (in fact, that could dry it out), but do wash up regularly, especially after workouts.\nPick out a shampoo and conditioner for your hair type. Use a deep treatment every so often to increase your hair's natural shine.\nBrush your teeth (and tongue!) at least twice a day. Make it a habit when you get up and right before go to bed. A whitening toothpaste will make your pearly whites glisten even more.\n\nWhile you're at it, floss and use mouthwash! Not only are they good habits to have, but they reduce your chances of gum disease and tooth decay.Use deodorant. Throughout the day, our body releases oils and odors that don't always help us look our best. Using deodorant regularly prevents any unnecessary smells from creeping out of nooks and crannies.\n\nDon't douse yourself in perfume or cologne. A light spray is a good idea, but smelling you from across the street, even if you smell like a field of daisies, is overpowering and less than ideal.\n\n;\n, Not only does 8 hours of sleep a night make you feel energized and ready for the day, it benefits your appearance and quality of life.(Prevents darker bags under your eyes too!)\n\n\nCirculation increases in our sleep. That means our skin is receiving the most nutrients it receives at night, preparing it to look healthier and glow. Sleep and metabolism are controlled by the same areas of the brain. Studies have shown that participants who get more sleep lose more fat than their counterparts, who lose more muscle. Sleep allows our brains time to consolidate memories. Not only does a healthy amount of sleep make for easier recall, but the same restructuring of memories spurs the creative process.Our attention is sharpened, making it easier to focus (and get better grades!).\nSleeping around 8 hours a night spurs athleticism, too. Athletes who slept around 10 hours a night experienced less daytime fatigue and faster running times. , Depending on your skin type, this could mean different things. But whatever skin you're in, develop a regimen catered to it.\n\n\n\nKnow your skin type. If you have dry skin, use a heavier, more moisturizing cleanser. If you have oily skin, stick to something light and oil-free. Wash up at least once a day to remove dirt and residue.\nIf you have acne, use treatments containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to combat blemishes on your own. If that's not working, consider seeing a dermatologist. Don't pop your zits--they'll scar your face and lead to more. Make-up works to cover them up in case of an emergency, but it clogs pores and can lead to more breakouts in the future.\nProtect your skin from the sun; even 15 minutes outside can start the process rolling. Use moisturizers and lip balms with SPF 15. Pale will always be more in than dark, splotchy, and wrinkly.\nDon't forget, part of skin is nails! How long or short you want them is up to you, but be sure to remove sharp edges and keep them clean. And don't miss your toes!\n\n, Every person has a different ideal hairstyle. Experiment with a few or consult a stylist.\n\n\nIf you've found a style you're happy with, maintain it well. Trim your hair every 6 to 8 weeks and remove tangles with a wide-toothed comb. Too much brushing can put stress on your scalp and hair.\nStay away from heat treatments and appliances. Unnatural levels of heat dry out your hair and weaken it, causing it to damage. Air dry your hair as often as possible.\n\nStyling men's hair follows the same general principles.\n Anyone wearing too much make-up is sending the world the message that they are not beautiful on their own. Stay natural-looking to seem organically perfect.\n\n\nUse powders to soak up shine.\nBlush and tinted lip balm will give your visage a rosy, sun-kissed look (without the damage).\nUse a bit of mascara to lengthen and accentuate your eyelashes.\n\nIf you have skin issues (or an occasion to wear more), familiarize yourself with how to wear concealer and foundation. Worn right it can look good, but worn wrong, it can look absolutely horrendous.\n There is no one \"perfect\" look; in fact, the look that is best on you is the one you are the most comfortable in.\n\n\nWhatever clothes you choose, make sure they're clean. Dirty is never trendy.\nDon't concern yourself with being fashionable. Trends come and go and it'll be exhausting keeping up. Instead, develop your own style and set them yourself. Your money will last longer and you'll be happier being yourself.\nWear clothes that fit and are appropriate. Too tight and you're trying too hard, too loose and your left hand is wasted holding them up. When trying on clothes, consider all angles and move around before buying.\n\n"}

There are a number of styles, each giving your room a different flavor and functioning in a slightly different way. Some of your options include:\n/images/thumb/0/07/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-1-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-1-preview-Version-3.jpg\n/images/thumb/0/07/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-1-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-1-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrapes are typically made from heavy material and are pleated, which requires a traverse rod. To hang, you must place drapery pins in the pleat, and then hang them on the rod. A cord allows you to pull the drapes open and closed.\nPanel curtains, eyelet curtains and tab top curtains are meant to hang from a plain round rod. They may have a pocket along the top to push the rod through, or the rod may be threaded through eyelets or tabs. Panel curtains may end at the top or bottom of the windowsill, extend to the floor, or be even longer\u2014a style known as puddling.\nCafe curtains cover only the bottom half of a window, to let light into the room while affording some privacy. They are popular on kitchen windows and are typically hung on rods installed inside the window frame on tension rods.\nDoor panels have pockets on the top and bottom and require 2 curtain rods, which you install on a door or simply attach with magnets. Door panels are often used on french doors and sidelights.;\n, When buying curtains, keep in mind that their length should cover the entire window (unless they are cafe curtains). If you buy tab top curtains, make sure the curtain length doesn't include the length of the tabs.\n/images/thumb/4/42/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-2-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-2-preview-Version-3.jpg\n/images/thumb/4/42/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-2-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-2-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFloor length curtains end 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the floor unless you live in a humid environment, in which case they should end 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the floor, because they will stretch more on humid days. If you plan to puddle your curtains, you only need to ensure you have plenty of material left over for the puddle.\nCurtains that hang below the sill should extend 4 inches (10 cm) below the sill, long enough to cover the edge of the casing below the window.\nSill-length curtains should skim the sill.\n If you'd like to pull them completely away from the window, buy a longer rod or a rod that has a return (a 90-degree turn on each end that allows you to push the curtain around the turn or rest against the wall). The length of the return should depend on the type and width of the curtain.\n/images/thumb/9/96/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-3-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-3-preview-Version-3.jpg\n/images/thumb/9/96/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-3-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-3-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Installing in the casing will always leave at least part of the window obscured, while installing outside the casing allows you to pull the curtains back completely. Which you choose will partially be determined by the style and look you want, but you may also have to account for the material of the wall or casing. If you have plastic window casing, the curtain rods will need to be installed on the wall. If you have plaster, cob, or stone walls, then the casing may be easier.\n/images/thumb/c/c3/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg\n/images/thumb/c/c3/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBear in mind that the curtain will only draw back as far as the brackets holding the curtain rod, whether or not you have a return, and the style of the curtain will determine how much they can be compressed. The amount you can compress a curtain is called the stack back.\nYou may want to keep part of the window covered even when the curtains are open, or you may prefer to completely expose the window to let as much light into the room as possible.\n Use a measuring tape. Determine where the top of the curtain will be from where you want the curtain to end: at the sill, below the sill or on the floor. Bear in mind that some styles of curtains have ruffles or pleats that extend above the top of the rod; subtract this section from the measurement. Mark this point on both sides of casing or wall with a pencil. Use a laser level to make sure your marks are even.\n/images/thumb/7/75/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-5-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-5-preview-Version-3.jpg\n/images/thumb/7/75/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-5-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-5-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, When you're sure of all your measurements, use a pencil to mark where the screws will go. Be careful not to get too close to the edge if installing in the casing, as this will make the material too fragile and cause the wood to crack.\n/images/thumb/3/36/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg\n/images/thumb/3/36/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Consider the length of the rod when hanging the brackets. Though most curtain rods are adjustable, you don't want the distance between the brackets to be so wide that the rod sags in the middle. In general, you shouldn't increase the length of the expanded\u00a0 rod by more than 50 percent.\n/images/thumb/4/47/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg\n/images/thumb/4/47/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This can keep the screws from cracking the casing or wall material. If installing the brackets on the wall, make sure your pilot holes are big enough to place the screw anchors into, if you need to use screw anchors.\n/images/thumb/b/ba/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg\n/images/thumb/b/ba/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScrew anchors are only necessary if the rod brackets are spaced in such a way that they cannot be attached to the wall studs. If you want to avoid using screw anchors, make sure that your brackets are spaced to go just 1-2\" beyond the casing.\n If installing them on the wall between studs, you need plastic screw anchors. These will expand inside the dry wall panel to the weight of the rod and curtains and will prevent the screws from pulling out of the wall. Otherwise, you can simply use the manufacturer included or suggested mounting screws.\n/images/thumb/2/26/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg\n/images/thumb/2/26/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Fit the rod onto the brackets and then use a carpenter's level to make sure that the rod is even. It should be, as long as you measured for level when marking the locations for brackets.\n/images/thumb/a/a8/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg\n/images/thumb/a/a8/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Remove the rod again and put the curtain on the rod. Hang the rod on the brackets. Now you're done! Good job!\n/images/thumb/c/cf/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-11-preview.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-11-preview.jpg\n/images/thumb/c/cf/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-11-preview.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-11-preview.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf hanging tab top curtains, a thin rod is best. A thick rod will draw the curtain up, making it hang too high.\n\n"}

Targeting a blog to your interests will help keep you engaged as a writer, and your passion for the subject will likely translate into enjoyable content for your readers.\nFocus upon an area of expertise. Maybe you work in computer programming, or have learned how to provide restricted-diet foods for your family. Use these skills as a foundation for developing a blog that will provide useful instruction for your readers.;\n, Careful attention to blog maintenance and to providing fresh content will help you grow and maintain a steady audience.\n\n\nCreate a regular schedule to keep yourself on track. Perhaps you'll plan to post a set number of times per week, or designate different content for different days -- a recipe each Monday and Wednesday, for example, on a culinary blog, with plans to share shopping advice on Tuesdays and an amusing anecdote on Thursdays.\nLearn how to schedule postings in advance. Popular blogging sites typically give you the option of drafting posts and then scheduling them for release at a future date and time. Doing so will enable you to keep your blog active even if you're out of town or otherwise occupied.\n While the process of setting up advertising links via ad players such as Google Ad Sense, Amazon Associates, or Pay-Per-Post is fairly straightforward, it may take several months before you start to receive ad revenue. Ads typically pay on a format of \"cost per thousand readers,\" or CPM, so drawing readers to your blog is very important.\n\n\nSearch for related blogs and post comments to draw readers to your site. Always remember to link your URL.Scan the Web for opportunities to participate in \"link ups\" hosted by prominent bloggers. Link ups offer you the chance to submit a blog post that will then be posted alongside other bloggers' posts in a collection of links.\nConsider learning \"search engine optimization,\" or SEO. This is a technique for improving the rate at which search engines such as Google list your blog postings in their search results. A quick Web search will yield tools to help you learn how SEO works., Payoff, however, comes both in the form of ad revenue and in the community successful blogs can create.\n\n\nThe number of hours successful bloggers put in per week varies, but remember that in addition to writing content, you'll need to spend time on advertising, networking, bookkeeping, and efforts to maximize your social media and search results. Consider 20 hours per week a reasonable starting point in terms of time commitment, then evaluate your own work pace and habits once you're underway.Plan to spend at least an hour or two drafting and an extra hour editing each post. Always, always proofread before posting to ensure your content is tidy and easily read.\n\n"}

The more parallel you are with the ground, the harder the exercise will be.\nYour strap should be at mid-body length.\n Lay face down on the ground with your feet pointed downward in the suspension straps. Lift your upper body up with your forearms flat on the ground. Your elbows should be just under your shoulders. Keeping your body straight and your forearms in place, hinge at the hips so that your buttocks lifts up slightly. This upward thrust is very subtle; basically, you just don't want your body sagging downward. Push yourself as far forward as you can go, then as far backward, which equals a single rep.Make sure to keep your back straight and your hips bending as you move forward and back.\nThe straps should be at calf-length.\n Start by facing away from the straps with your arms straight out in front of you in the straps. Keeping your hands in front of you, bring your torso down until it's about even with your hands, then push out your arms straight again, which makes one rep.When moving into the pushup, put your weight on the balls of your feet.\nTry starting out more upright (less than 90 degrees), and moving down to 90 degrees as you get more confident.\nThe strap should be at about mid-body for this exercise.\n You'll likely need to adjust the straps longer for this exercise. A clock press is similar to a pushup in suspension, but you add an extra move. Face away from the straps. The straps should be in your hands, across the palms with your arms extended. Bending your arms, lean forward until your arms and upper body reach the point of the pushup where you'd typically be near the floor. Your upper body should be in line with your hands. Push one arm straight out to the side, and then bring it back in. Do the same with the other arm. Push back up into the standing position, straightening out your arms again.Your heels should be off the ground for this exercise.\nStart out with just a gradual incline and work up to a greater incline as you gain strength.\nAlso, keep your elbows in line with the ribs and hands in front of the elbows.

Then from the right side of the lower receiver install the magazine catch spring. Last, push the magazine catch button towards the magazine catch, and spin to tighten. Spin until the magazine catch is flush or nearly flush with the button.;\n, Before you start, use some masking tape to cover the lower receiver just to the right of where you install the bolt catch. This masking tape will prevent scratches when you tap in the bolt catch roll pin.\n\n\nFirst, insert the roll pin and tap it in part way. Second, insert the bolt catch spring and buffer. When you do this the spring should face in, and the buffer out. Now you are ready to install the bolt catch.\nHold the spring tension on the plunger, and align the hole in the bolt release with the roll pinhole in the lower receiver. Use a punch to tap the pin all the way in. Alternatively you could use a pair of pliers and press the pin in.\nIf your bolt catch is sticky after installation there is a problem. The hole in the bolt catch should be large enough that the bolt catch release pin can pass through. If you have this problem, you can do one of two things:\n\nCall your vendor and get a replacement part.\nReam out the hole with a tiny drill, or grind it with a Dremel or very small round needle file.\n First, insert the spring in the detent hole, next insert the detent. Note that you will need to force the detent in against the spring. While the detent is in, use the pivot pin to hold the detent back down in its hole against the spring, as you insert the pivot pin in its hole in the lower receiver. When in, the pivot pin will hold the detent in place.\n Slip the trigger guard between the support ears on your receiver. Gently tap the roll pin in place. Be careful that the hole in the trigger guard stays aligned with the holes in the two ears on the receiver, as you tap in the pin. If the holes are misaligned you will bend your pin.\n Drop the trigger and the trigger spring assembly into the lower receiver. Push the disconnector over the coil spring. Then insert a trigger pin through the lower receiver, through the disconnector, and to the other side of the receiver. You may have to wiggle it a little, but it will go.\n Insert the hammer and hammer spring assembly into the lower receiver. The two long legs of the hammer spring will rest on the top of the pin installed in the \"Install the trigger\" step. Push the hammer into the receiver until the holes in the hammer line up with the holes in the receiver. Then lightly tap the pins in. Cock the hammer.\n\n\nNote that the hammer is under tension, so you will have to push/squeeze the hammer in to get the pin holes to line up.\n To install the safety selector, place the selector detent and the spring into the detent hole.\n When installing the pistol grip make sure that the selector spring goes into the hole in the grip.\n Install the detent and the spring, then install the pin in the rear of the receiver. Note that this rear pin will be held in place when you install the stock in the next step.\n Thread the rifle/carbine buffer tube into the receiver. Do this slowly and carefully, thread until just to the buffer hole. Then insert the buffer pin and buffer spring into the buffer stop. After the buffer pin and spring is in, thread some more. Go until the rifle/carbine tube holds the rear takedown pin in place. Note, the rifle/carbine tube should hold the pin in place but it should not touch the center of the pin and bind the pin's movement.\n\n\nWhether you have a CAR nut or a castle nut, you can use a CAR wrench to tighten the stock.\nYou may choose to add a drop or two of loctite to the threads of the nut before tightening. This is optional, and if you plan on disassemble soon, you may choose not to do this.\n Cock the hammer; insert the spring, and then the buffer. Push the buffer in past the buffer pin.\n Perform a trigger mechanism check as follows :\n\n\nVerify that hammer locks to the rear when pushed back.\nVerify that hammer pivots forward when trigger is pressed.\nWithout releasing the trigger, push the hammer back again and verify that it locks (caught by disconnector).\nReleasing the trigger should not cause the hammer to pivot fully forward (caught by trigger).\nHammer will fall when trigger is pressed.\n Your lower receiver is now complete or assembled, and ready for an assembled upper receiver.\n\n\nIt is important, that you do not \"dry fire\" your completed lower receiver by itself. Doing so may damage the lower. Wait until you have assembled your lower receiver with your upper receiver. Only then, when your firearm is fully assembled is dry firing okay.\n\n"}

Fields of corn, wheat, and berries provide rich sources of food and are frequented by turkeys.\nWooded areas provide turkeys with places to roost.

Female (hen) droppings are round and circular in shape.If you wish to hunt on private land, you should contact the landowner and request permission well ahead of your planned hunt. Following up with a small gift is a common courtesy.\n After you\u2019ve scouted out the terrain and have a good sense of the lay of the land, follow the flocks closely. Stage decoys close to roosts and employ various calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up blinds in close range (40 yards or so) of your decoys.\nPut your back against a tree. This helps to obscure you from the turkey\u2019s vision and allows you to position firearms without being seen.\n Only aim the gun when you're sure you have a clear shot of the turkey. You may need to employ alternate tactics to isolate turkeys to gain those clear shots:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPick off loners. You can gain a prime shot of a lone turkey by attracting it over with soft, alluring purrs.\nScatter and recall. If you are unable to tease a stray turkey out of a flock, try creeping in close to a group of poults and hens and begin waving your arms wildly and making loud sounds to scatter the birds. Once they scatter (and hopefully not just fly away altogether), begin to lure them back with soft kee kee runs or lost yelps.Block the route to their food. If you\u2019ve successfully tracked the flock and know where they feed in the morning, set up between their roost and their food. Place a hen decoy near your blind and make a series of yelps to attract the toms.\n Shooting the neck and head area raises the odds that you will kill the bird immediately. If you fail to kill the bird and only wound it, track the bird quickly and kill it humanely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The basic formula is: P = 2 * (l + w).Perimeter is always the total distance around the outside edge of any shape, whether it is simple or compound.\nIn this equation, P stands for \u201cperimeter,\u201d l refers to the length of the rectangle, and w refers to the width of the rectangle.\nLength always has a greater value than width.\nBecause opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, both lengths will be the same and both widths will be the same. This is why you write the equation as a multiplication of the sum of the length and width by 2.\nYou can also write the equation as P = l + l + w + w to make this very clear.;\n, For a basic math problem at school, the length and width of the rectangle will be provided in the problem. These are usually next to the figure of the rectangle.\n\n\nIf you are calculating the perimeter of a rectangle in real life, use a ruler, yardstick, or tape measure to find the length and width of the area that you are trying to measure. If you\u2019re measuring outdoors, measure all sides to see if the opposites are truly congruent.\nFor example, l = 14 centimeter (5.5\u00a0in), w = 8 centimeter (3.1\u00a0in).\n\n\n\nWhen you are working out your perimeter equations, note that according to the order of operations, mathematical expressions contained inside brackets or parentheses are solved before those outside of the parentheses.So, you\u2019ll begin solving your equation by adding the length and width.\nFor example, P = 2 * (l + w) = 2 * (14 + 8) = 2 * (22).\n When you\u2019re looking the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, the \u201c(l + w)\u201d is multiplied by two. Once you\u2019ve completed this multiplication, you have the perimeter of your rectangle.\n\n\nThis multiplication takes into account the other two sides of your rectangle. When you added together the width and length, you only added together two sides of the shape.\nSince the other two sides of the rectangle are equal to the two already added together, you can simply multiply this measurement by two in order to find the total sum of all four sides.\nFor example, P = 2 * (l + w) = 2 * (14 + 8) = 2 * (22) = 44 centimeter (17.3\u00a0in).\n\n\n\nIf you struggle with the concept of perimeter, this is a great place to start.\nFor example, P = l + l + w + w = 14 + 14 + 8 + 8 = 44 centimeter (17.3\u00a0in).\n\n"}

Sometimes the esophagus is inflamed enough that swallowing becomes difficult, since the food has limited space to pass.When the acid reflux from the stomach goes up the esophagus to the vocal cords, it can cause hoarseness and a sore throat. Although these are common signs of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well, when associated with esophagitis, they are usually accompanied with difficult or painful swallowing. ;\n, Heartburn is a common symptom of esophagitis when it is related to reflux. When acid leaves the stomach and enters the esophagus, it will cause a burning sensation because the cells of the esophagus were not designed to withstand an acidic environment.\n If you have eosinophilic esophagitis, there is a buildup of white cells called (eosinophils) in the esophagus and stomach. The white cells produce a protein which causes inflammation in your throat and can lead to scarring narrowing and formation of excessive fibrous tissue in the lining of your esophagus.An allergic response might also induce stomach pain and nausea and/or vomiting.This can occur at almost any age, and happens more commonly in Caucasian men.\nAs a result to the inflammation, you may have difficulty swallowing food. The esophagus can narrow to the point that food cannot pass through and becomes impacted. This is a medical emergency and requires the immediate care of a surgeon., You can affect your risk for esophagitis through some of the lifestyle choices you make.Alcohol reduces the strength of the lower esophageal sphincter and can trigger gastroesophageal reflux, or stomach acid that refluxes up the esophagus. This creates irritation and inflammation in the lining of the esophagus. Take note how you feel after you drink alcohol. See if you start to notice a trend.\n\n\nCigarette smoking has the same effect on the esophagus.\n Acidic foods and caffeinated beverages will also increase the acidity in the stomach. These can increase the risk of reflux and trigger esophagitis. Write down the foods you eat and how you feel in the hours after you eat.\n Drug-induced esophagitis is triggered when you swallow pills with little to no water. The residue from the pill remains in the esophagus, creating irritation and inflammation. Some of the more common medications to create this problem includes pain relievers such as ibuprofen, aspirin and naproxen sodium, antibiotics, potassium chloride, biphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis, and quinidine used for treatment of some heart conditions.\n Reflux esophagitis occurs when the stomach acid refluxes through the lower esophageal sphincter and into the esophagus. GERD is a condition in which this backflow is a chronic problem. One complication of GERD is tissue damage to the esophagus leading to esophagitis., Your risk for esophagitis can increase because of pre-existing medical conditions.For example, surgery or radiation to the chest will weaken the lower esophageal sphincter and increase your risk of experiencing esophagitis.\nChronic vomiting weakens the sphincter from pressure in the stomach and thus increases the risk of esophagitis.\nPeople with a weakened immune system from medications or an immune-mediated illness such as HIV can develop infections that lead to esophagitis. These infections include those due to fungi or viruses such as herpes or cytomegalovirus.\n Infectious esophagitis can be the result of a bacterial, viral or fungal infection. Although relatively rare, this type of esophagitis will occur more often in people with poor immune function, such as people suffering from HIV, leukemia, chemotherapy treatments for cancer, diabetes or organ transplant.Symptoms associated with infectious esophagitis can include:\n\n\nFever and chills associated with the infection.\nOral thrush if the infectious agent is candida albicans\nIf the infection is herpes or cytomegalovirus, you may experience sores in your mouth or in the back of your throat, making swallowing food or saliva even more uncomfortable.\n You may be having an allergic reaction that can cause esophagitis. Eosinophilic esophagitis can occur in response to an allergic reaction or from acid-reflux or both. Eosinophils are white blood cells that play a role in allergic reactions in the body. Sometimes the allergy is to foods, such as milk, eggs, wheat, soy or peanuts. At other times, people can have non-food reactions to pollen or dander, which causes esophagitis.\n In many cases, esophagitis will clear spontaneously within three to five days. This is especially true when the trigger was taking medication without enough water and you start drinking lots of water with medication. If you resolve your GERD, then the esophagitis will also begin to heal spontaneously.\n\n\nStop eating the foods that cause an allergic reaction (eosinophilic esophagitis), and the inflammation and irritation will resolve.\n Some people experience symptoms that necessitate a visit to the doctor in order to prevent further physical damage.Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice:\n\n\nSymptoms that last more than a few days.\nSymptoms that don\u2019t improve or go away with over-the-counter antacids, changes to the way you take medications, or when you stop eating the foods causing the allergic reaction.\nSymptoms that are severe enough that you have difficulty eating.\nAny symptoms of esophagitis accompanied by signs of infection, such as muscle aches, headache and fever.\nAny symptoms of esophagitis that is accompanied by shortness of breath or chest pain that happens shortly after eating.\n Emergency care is needed if your symptoms also include:\n\n\nYou suspect that you have food lodged in the esophagus.\nYou have a history of heart disease or experience chest pain.\nYou experience chest pain that lasts more than a couple minutes.\nYou vomit blood, which can indicate bleeding from the esophagus.\nYou have black tarry stools, which indicate bleeding in the digestive tract. Blood turns black with a tar appearance after exposure to digestive enzymes. If the esophagus is bleeding, it can either turn the stool black in color or you may vomit blood.\n Your doctor will make a diagnosis based on a thorough history and physical examination as well as one or more tests. Keep in mind that your doctor will recommend treatment based on the cause of esophagitis.\n A barium x-ray, usually called a Barium swallow, is an imaging study which uses a barium solution that lines the esophagus and stomach, making the organs more visible. These images will identify any narrowing of the esophagus. They can also indicate any other structural changes, such as hernias, tumors or other abnormalities.\n An endoscopy is a test which uses a tiny camera placed down the throat into the esophagus. Your doctor will look for any unusual appearance of the esophagus. This procedure also gives your doctor the opportunity to remove small tissue samples for testing. The appearance of the esophagus can change if the esophagitis is caused from drugs, reflux or eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\n\nTissue samples removed during an endoscopy can be tested for bacterial, viral or fungal infections, determine if there are white blood cells (eosinophils) in the tissue and identify abnormal cells that could indicate cancer or precancerous changes.\n These medications block and control acid production, are often the first line of defense.They may not work for all patients, but some people respond well and will experience relief from inflammation.\n\n\nIf you don't respond to PPIs, your doctor may prescribe a steroid such as fluticasone or budesonide., These are prescription or over-the-counter medications which reduce the production of stomach acid.These medications include famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), ranitidine (Zantac).Talk to your doctor about which H2 blocker is right for you.\n\n\nCommon side effects include constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, hives, nausea or vomiting, or problems with urination., If your doctor diagnoses you with esophagitis and he determines that it is triggered by reflux, your doctor may prescribe periodic surveillance endoscopy. This means that periodically, depending upon the severity of your symptoms and any other problems you might be having, your doctor will perform an endoscopy. He will look for tissue changes and evaluate tissue samples for precancerous conditions., Left untreated, esophagitis can result in narrowing of the esophagus from scar tissue. This is called a stricture of the esophagus. This causes swallowing to be difficult until the stricture is treated and the esophagus returns to a normal size.Barrett\u2019s esophagus is a second long-term side effect of chronic inflammation and irritation to the esophagus. As the esophagus tries to heal the cells in the esophagus change to those similar to cells found in the intestines. This type of cell change is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer. The tissue changes that are characteristic of Barrett\u2019s esophagus cause no symptoms for the individual. The risk is small but it\u2019s important to have regular checkups. If precancerous cells are discovered, they can be treated immediately.\nChronic and uncontrolled inflammation can also trigger irreversible structural alterations. This leads to tissue fibrosis, stricture formation and ultimately impaired function of the esophagus. This remodeling of the esophagus can require surgical intervention.\nOther long-term consequences of untreated esophagitis resulting from reflux include damage to the lungs and upper esophageal area, such as asthma, laryngitis and chronic coughing. These changes are the result of the exposure of the cells in the lungs and larynx to stomach acid, which also triggers the inflammatory response in the esophagus.\n If you are afflicted by esophagitis, you should consider how your diet is contributing to the condition. Making some changes to your diet may help you overcome your esophagitis.Try the following strategies:\n\n\nEat several small meals during the day.\nEliminate chocolate, mints and alcohol.\nDon\u2019t eat any foods that give you an allergic response.\nAvoid foods high in acid and other foods that trigger your heartburn.\nAvoid stooping over or bending immediately after meals. This increases the pressure in the stomach and triggers reflux.\nWait for at least three hours after eating to lie down or go to bed.\n Too much excess body weight can contribute to pressure on your abdomen. Talk to your doctor to determine a healthy weight for your body frame. Maintaining this weight will reduce pressure on the stomach and the lower esophageal sphincter. , Smoking can contribute to your chances of developing esophagitis.Give up smoking by making a plan to quit and using products to help you quit (such as nicotine gum or a nicotine patch).\n When your clothes are too tight, you may be putting added pressure on your stomach and lower esophageal sphincter. Go for clothes that fit properly or slightly loosely. Find pants that fit your waist comfortably instead of pants with a tight waistband.\n Taking medications without drinking plenty of water with them can cause irritation to the lining of the esophagus and trigger esophagitis. Some of these medication include tetracycline, doxycycline, alendronate, ibandronate and vitamin C. Take all medication with plenty of water to reduce the irritation to the esophagus.\n When you elevate the head of your bed, your head will be higher than your chest, causing acid to stay in your stomach. Place wooden blocks under the head of the bed to elevate it. Do not use pillows to elevate your head. This causes you to bend in the middle, both increasing the pressure on the abdomen and increasing the potential for back and neck problems.\n\n"}

Try to find a different color for every day of the week. You can mix and match the other clothing and accessories you have based around this color. This will force you to create some cute outfits.You do not have to have a shirt or a pair of pants in your desired color. Maybe most of your shirts tend to be black, brown, and green, but you have a few more colorful scarves or vests.\nMaybe a purple scarf could be worn with a black top and lavender shoes, for example. A red vest could be worn over a plain black t-shirt.;\n, If you have an outfit that feels so-so, use a belt. Belts can be used to make an outfit stand out from the crowd.If you have a belt in an interesting color, or one that comes with a decorative buckle, you could tuck in your shirt for the day and wear that belt.\nYou can also tie a belt around your waist. A loose-fitting shirt or dress can highlight your figure better if you have a belt around your waist.\n You may feel like you can't wear the same outfit twice, but a good pair of pants or shirt can be used in multiple outfits. Try going for an unusual combination one day and see how you like your new style.For example, maybe you have a longer shirt that flows a little. You could wear it with a pair of skinny jeans. You could also tuck it into a skirt, or wear it with a belt down the middle.\nIf you have a button down shirt, you could wear it mostly buttoned up one day. The next week, you could wear it unbuttoned with a nice t-shirt underneath. You could also add a tie, if there's a more formal occasion happening at your school.\n A simple cardigan can add color and flare to an outfit. A dull sleeveless blouse or t-shirt can be worn under an interesting, colorful cardigan.For example, say you have a white, sleeveless blouse or a plain white t-shirt. This may look a little dull on its own. However, add a colorful or patterned cardigan. This can make your outfit cuter.\nIf you want to highlight your figure, a belt can also be wrapped around a cardigan.\n You can actually download a phone app that will give you wardrobe suggestions based on the clothing in your closet. If you have a smart phone, try using the app ClosetSpace.You upload pictures or descriptions of your items to the app. The app with then offer you suggestions on what to wear. You can cater those suggestions for a particular event, style, or season.\n Once you've found a good outfit, record it. If you're lacking inspiration one morning, look at recent photos. You may find something that inspires you to come up with a new outfit. Recording your best outfits will also help you start thinking about forming your own personal style., You can hang out with a fashionable friend, look at fashion blogs, and read fashion magazines. Look at people dressed in a variety of outfits. Notice what makes their style unique.If there's a particular model you like, start looking up pictures of him or her. Is there something unique about this model's style? Does he or she always wear sunglasses, for example, or tend to dress in a particular color?\nRemember, fashion magazines are often trying to get you to buy something. As you browse magazines, remember you don't have to break the bank to be fashionable. Do not be tempted to order a $50 cardigan. Just write down the type you liked and you can probably find something similar, and cheaper, at a local clothing store.\n If you're in love with a particular color, this could be the staple of your wardrobe. If a particular color looks good on you, and you find yourself wearing it a lot, think about how you could always incorporate this color into your wardrobe.Undertones in your skin can determine whether you have a warm of cool complexion. If you have pink, red, or bluish undertones, you have a cool complexion. Colors like greens, blues, purples, and pinks look best on you.If you have yellow, peachy, or golden undertones in your skin, you have a warm complexion. You would look best in yellows, reds, oranges, and browns.Think about both your complexion and your color preferences. Personality may come into play as well. If you're loud and confident, red may be a good signature color. Once you've selected a signature color, try to add it to every aspect of your wardrobe.\n You can refer back to your wardrobe diary. You can also simply consider what kind of outfits tend to be most flattering on you.Pull five things from your wardrobe you wear regularly. Figure out why they work for you. For example, maybe you pull out three long and loose tops and two pairs of fitted jeans. Maybe you have a longer torso and slim legs, so longer tops and tight jeans work well for you.\nEvaluate these items. How can they speak to a signature look? What is missing? Maybe you want a little more color. If your signature color is red, for example, a pair of red skinny jeans can be added to your outfit. Maybe you want to make things slightly more formal. You could look for a long button down red top.\n Pull out five clothing items from your closet you never wear. These can even be items you wish you had not bought. Try to figure out why they don't work for you.For instance, you pull out three t-shirts and two skirts. These are very different from the longer tops and tight jeans you pulled out earlier. Maybe t-shirts look awkward on you due to your longer frame, and you dislike that skirts hide your legs.\nNow, you can begin to see what types of clothing you prefer. These types of clothing can be made into your signature look.\n You have an idea of what kind of clothes you should go for. From here, think about how to expand on what you have. You may find you can add accessories and new clothing items to cultivate your look.Returning to the example, you picked red because you feel bold and confident. How you can you make your clothing express this while sticking to the style that most flatters you?\nMore patterns could help with boldness. Look at a long, polka-dotted red blouse. Choose bright red skinny jeans, to be worn with black top.\nWhat accessories convey boldness? A clunky red necklace? A bright red watch? A red belt? Maybe you could paint your fingernails red, or use striking red lipstick.\n Many people have a look defined by a signature item. Is there an accessory you love? Maybe you could incorporate this accessory into your style every day, or most days.Maybe you've always loved watches. You can get a wide collection of different watches and wear one every day. You can have some of these watches come in shades of your signature color.\nMaybe you have a lot of affection for hoop earrings. Try to wear pairs in different sizes, shapes, and colors each day.\n If you want to shop to ramp up your wardrobe, make sure you don't buy anything you do not need. Certain wardrobe staples appear in most people's closets. Scan your closet for the following items prior to a shopping trip:A small black dress or a black blazer\nBlack trousers or pants\nA white button down shirt\nBlue jeans\nDark jeans\nA white cardigan and a black cardigan\n\n, If you need any of the above items, buy them when you're shopping. Something like, say, a black cardigan can be used in multiple outfits. Such items give your wardrobe more mix and match potential, adding to the cute outfits you can assemble for school., Go into your shopping trip having some sense of what you want. Remember your signature style. Select a few items that could be added to existing clothing in your wardrobe to create a cute outfit based around your style.For example, the warmer months are coming and you need some summer outfits. Your signature color is red, so look for red shorts, t-shirts, and tank tops.\nYour shoes are almost always red, so you'll need a pair of red flip-flops or sandals.\nYou can also shop just for day-to-day items. You have a great button down red shirt. Buy a vest to go with it, as well as a watch with a red strap. This creates a new outfit from a single shirt.\n As you shop, be on the lookout for anything that can enhance your personal style. Keep in mind what you're known for in your school style-wise, and look for items that compliment this.Maybe your fingernails are always painted different colors. Browse the cosmetics section to find nail polish colors you have not yet tried.\nMaybe you're known to wear a lot of wrist bands. Stop by a store like Hot Topic and buy some new wrist bands for your wardrobe.\n\n"}

Some items can be ruined in the freezer, and there isn\u2019t a lot of room for storage. Think about smaller items that won\u2019t be affected by the temperatures.\n\n\nMini-sized items fit perfectly in frozen vegetable bags. They know you don\u2019t like broccoli, so they put what they want to hide where you\u2019d least want to go.\nHiding something in a frozen dessert would be a clever choice. A box of ice cream sandwiches is prime for hiding things. Your parents know you want desserts and aren\u2019t allowed to have them without permission. More than likely have an idea of how much is left.\nCheck behind the ice. If there are ice cube trays, move them and check underneath or behind. Also, some older freezers get a bit of ice buildup in them, a great spot to hide something small like a charger.\n Believe it or not, there are safes and hiding spots made to look just like food. Books, cases, and folders are way more obvious than food hiding locations.\n\n\nWho would even think about hiding something inside a head of lettuce? Well, it\u2019s been done.Frozen bags of vegetables are very tricky locations to hide from kids. Parents know you're very unlikely to look there.\nLook behind vegetables in the pantry. Vegetables are often bunched together, which would make a prime hiding spot for kids who don't like vegetables.\n The fact there are so many options makes the hiding spot time-consuming to discover. They may have even wrapped the hidden contents in bubble-wrap so there is no noise.\n\n\nSniff the spices. Emptied coffee cans or spice jars are great diversion safes. They\u2019re fairly common, but really difficult to find since there are so many spices. Shake pill bottles. Emptied out medicine bottles are brilliant spots for tiny items or rolls of money. Check their medicine cabinet or maybe even a potted plant.Squirt some lotion. An emptied out lotion bottle is an ideal location for spare keys, small remotes, cell phones, and credit cards., Your parents already know you're not going to use several appliances in the house. Try searching in, on, or behind appliances that are big enough to conceal something.\n\n\nPull out the vacuum. The vacuum cleaner is perfect for hiding big things out in the open. Vacuums have a large, easily accessible cavity to stuff in various items.Mixers often have bowls big enough to use as hiding spots. Tip each bowl carefully and see if there is something inside.\nOpen doors on all appliances. The oven, the microwave, the toaster-oven, they all make great hiding spots, especially if your parents are the only ones who cook.\n\n"}

It doesn\u2019t matter what order you list the fractions.\n\nIf you have any mixed fractions, you will need to convert them to improper fractions before comparing and ordering. A mixed fraction is a fraction that contains a whole number and a fraction. For instructions on how to do this, read Change Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions.\n\nFor example, if you are comparing 58{\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{8}}}, 24{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}}, and 37{\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{7}}}, you could list the fractions like this:58{\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{8}}}24{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}}37{\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{7}}}\n\n\n, This will be your new denominator for all three fractions, so place this product underneath all three blank fraction bars.\n\nYou can complete the multiplication by using a calculator or by using the standard multiplication algorithm.\n\nFor example, if you are comparing and 58{\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{8}}}, 24{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}}, and 37{\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{7}}}, you would calculate 8\u00d74\u00d77=224{\\displaystyle 8\\times 4\\times 7=224}. Your fractions will then be listed like this:58x224{\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{8}}\\;{\\frac {x}{224}}}24x224{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}\\;{\\frac {x}{224}}}37x224{\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{7}}\\;{\\frac {x}{224}}}\n\n\n, To figure this out, divide the new denominator by the original denominator. Draw a line from each original denominator to each new denominator. Write the missing factor on the line.\n\nFor example:You must multiply 8 by 28 to arrive at 224, so on the line next to 58{\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{8}}}, write \u00d728{\\displaystyle \\times 28}. You must multiply 4 by 56 to arrive at 224, so on the line next to 24{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}}, write \u00d756{\\displaystyle \\times 56}. You must multiply 7 by 32 to arrive at 224, so on the line next to 37{\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{7}}}, write \u00d732{\\displaystyle \\times 32}.\n To do this, multiply each original numerator by the same factor you multiplied its denominator by. Fill in the new numerators above the fraction bars.\n\nFor example:You multiplied the denominator of 58{\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{8}}} by 28, so you must multiply the numerator by 28. 5\u00d728=140{\\displaystyle 5\\times 28=140}, so the fraction 58{\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{8}}} becomes 140224{\\displaystyle {\\frac {140}{224}}}. You multiplied the denominator of 24{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}} by 56, so you must multiply the numerator by 56. 2\u00d756=112{\\displaystyle 2\\times 56=112}, so the fraction 24{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}} becomes 112224{\\displaystyle {\\frac {112}{224}}}.You multiplied the denominator of 37{\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{7}}} by 32, so you must multiply the numerator by 32. 3\u00d732=96{\\displaystyle 3\\times 32=96}, so the fraction 37{\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{7}}} becomes 96224{\\displaystyle {\\frac {96}{224}}}.\n The larger the numerator, the larger the fraction. You can now order them this way because you found a common denominator and are working with same-sized pieces.\n\nFor example, to compare 140224{\\displaystyle {\\frac {140}{224}}}, 112224{\\displaystyle {\\frac {112}{224}}}, and 96224{\\displaystyle {\\frac {96}{224}}}, look at their numerators.Since, 140>112>96,{\\displaystyle 140>112>96,} you know that 140224>112224>96224{\\displaystyle {\\frac {140}{224}}>{\\frac {112}{224}}>{\\frac {96}{224}}}. If you reduce the fractions, your final answer will be 58>24>37{\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{8}}>{\\frac {2}{4}}>{\\frac {3}{7}}}.\n\n\n"}

Apply the mixture to your face, and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, peel it off.\nMake sure you don't get the mixture near your eyebrows or eyes. When you peel the mask off, you should find that unwanted facial hair (and blackheads) come off with it.\n Fruit-based scrubs can help you remove unwanted facial hair without the harshness of chemical products.\n\n\nFor the lemon/orange peel scrub, mix together 1 teaspoon each of powdered orange and lemon peel, ground almond, and oatmeal. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of rose water. Mixing these items should create a paste. Put the paste on your face for about 5-8 minutes. Rub the paste into your skin with small circular movements. Then rinse your face with water. You will need to do this 2-3 times a week to see results.\nFor the apricot scrub, grind half a cup of dried apricots in a blender until it's a powder. Then add 1 teaspoon of honey. Apply to face for 5-10 minutes. Rub into skin with small circular movements, and then rinse with lukewarm water. You also need to use this scrub 2-3 times a week to see any difference.\n Tumeric has been used for a long time in India to improve the look of the skin. You can make a homemade paste out of it.

Then, wash it off with warm water.\nThis paste will work best for people with fine facial hair. If the hair is denser, you could add oatmeal to the paste.\n Another natural remedy for removing facial hair can be made with eggs. You need 1 egg white, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1/2 tablespoon of cornflour.\n\n\nBeat them together until it turns into a paste. Apply the paste to your face, and let it dry. It will turn into a thin mask.\nPull the mask off firmly, and you should see the hair come off with it.\n\n"}

Organize them carefully so that when you start the identification process, you don\u2019t get details mixed up.;\n, Whether you choose a book or a website as your field guide, this is most certainly the next step in identification. Spend time beforehand getting to know the layout and format of your guide, so that you can use it with ease.\n\n\nField guides are organized into groups of birds that are related to one another. The groups are listed from the least-evolved to the most-evolved birds. Many guides have helpful color tabs to make the process a bit easier for you.\nWhen trying to identify a bird, look at the bird rather than the book or image. The bird provides all the details and leads the way. It\u2019s easy to get distracted by things you see in the book, but it\u2019s the bird that provides all of the field marks and identifiers! At this point in the identification process, any photographs you took of the bird are incredibly helpful.\n There are multiple options for bird search engines online. You can enter a bird name, shape, region, field marks - as much or as little information as you have. These search engines are extremely accurate and incredibly easy to use!\n\n, There are some excellent ones out there for a broad range of different technologies and most of them are free! Do an app search with your device(s) and research your options. Some of the most popular field guides are also available in app form!\n\n, Some common group examples are warblers, flycatchers, hawks, owls, and wrens.Later, when it comes to the identification process and using your field guide, this skill is invaluable because field guides are organized by bird group. Spend some time with books or websites that can help you learn these groups.\n Once you get bitten by the bird bug, you should obtain a good field guide to assist you. You can purchase field guides inexpensively, or check out one from a local library. Your local Audubon Society will also have field guides.You want a guide that is easy to use, portable, accurate and specific to your region.\n\n\nIn general, painted pictures in field guides are best to use. You can also try a mixed approach by checking out guides that use photos rather than paintings.\nEven electronic field guides are available! Unlike printed field guides, these guides have videos and sound clips to guide you in identifying birds.\n The more details you can see on a bird, the more easily you can identify it! There is a large range of products with a variety of prices available.It\u2019s all about your personal preference and what you can afford.\n Taking down notes in the field and consulting your field guide later is generally considered to be the best method of identification, allowing you to focus fully on the bird and fixing it more readily in your memory. , Photos to go along with your notes in the field are incredibly useful for identification. This can be done as simply as using the camera on your phone. Serious birders usually opt for a professional grade camera in the field. By and large, digital images have almost completely replaced film in bird photography.\n\n\nIf you do choose to use the camera on your phone, there are excellent adapters that you can buy that will tremendously improve the quality of those images. These are usually very lightweight and portable.\nSerious birders suggest a camera that can manually override the automatic functions. Birds can be difficult to photograph, so you need a camera you can customize to what you\u2019re seeing in the field.Carrying a tripod along with you in the field while you are birding will improve your photographs significantly., Many state and national parks have checklists of the birds seen in the park.These can be incredibly useful. Field guides can be purchased that focus on specific regions or you can obtain more general guides.\n\n\nCheck out Wildbirds.com. There you can research checklists that cover every single state in the Unites States, among other regions., Do some research about the habitat each species of bird prefers. After learning about the habitats, learn about bird songs you hear in your own backyard. Then move on to research the songs of other birds that you know are found in your region. To find a bird, you will often hear it first!\n\n\nWildBirds.com is a great resource for assisting you in finding birds. Do a quick Google search to find other websites about birds and birding locations in your state or area of the country. There are tons of excellent websites out there that will help you find information about the birds in your region!\nBringing the birds to you is also an option! Read up on particular plants that can draw birds in your area. Consider a bird feeder and building a bird house.\n Distance, tricky lighting, individual variation, and a host of other deterrents can confuse or disguise some of a bird\u2019s most obvious field marks, such as the color of its plumage. Because of this, first take note of its size and structure.\n\n\nUse size relativity to get a general idea of the birds size. Size relativity refers to being bigger or smaller than a bird you are familiar with, such as a sparrow, robin, crow, or pigeon. Keep in mind that a common mistake that even experienced bird-watchers make is to overestimate the size of a bird. , The silhouette can provide insight pertaining to the group and sometimes even the species of a bird. When examining silhouettes, pay attention to the body shape, tail shape, beak length and body proportions.\n As your observation skills improve, familiarize yourself with the field marks. Field marks are colored or patterned areas on the bird's body, head, and wings that help distinguish species.Check for wing \u007fbars (stripes across the folded wings).\nInspect the wing tips (color of the pointed end of the wings).\nExamine the wing lining (color of underside of the wing).\nCheck for wing patches (blocks of color on the wings).\nLook for an eyebrow stripe (the color of stripe above the eye).\nNote any throat patches (color blocks around the throat area).\nLook for an eye ring (the ring of color around the eye).\nExamine the upper and lower beak color.\n Many birds have distinctive postures that can help you differentiate between them. Pay attention to the bird\u2019s posture when it is walking and moving about, as well as when it is perched. Noting whether the posture of the perched bird is vertical or horizontal can be very helpful during identification. Check the posture while the bird is feeding and resting, as well. , Most species of birds are born in and live all of their lives in one particular habitat. Did you see the bird in a forest, a marsh, an empty field, in the desert or near the sea? Did you see it at night or during the day? This can help you considerably when trying to narrow down the identity of a bird.\n\n\nTake note of the location. What part of the country did you see the bird?\n\n, Identifying birds in flight can be challenging, since you may only get a short glimpse and the distance between you and the bird in flight can be vast. Nevertheless, there are some key features that can be revealed in flight that can help you identify many types of birds. , Birds, particularly males, use their song to attract a mate and to protect their territories. They sing the most in the early morning during breeding season, and they normally repeat the same song over and over. Pay attention to what the bird is doing while singing. Connecting the song to an activity can be very helpful for identification. Break the song into different parts such as tone, pitch and rhythm. This is much easier than trying to identify all of it at once. Try to translate the sound into words or a pattern than you can remember. "}

In the first case, your marriage will be the focus of attention. In the second case, helping you and your spouse learn better ways of managing the challenges of your mental illness will be the focus.\n\n\nIf you've determined that you want help for a troubled marriage, be aware that this will be considered your \"diagnosis.\" This diagnosis code is V61.1 Relational Problems in the DSM V. Knowing the difference between a \"diagnostic code\" and a \"procedural code\" will be important when you contact your insurance company.;\n, Most contracts have a clause that reads something like this: \u201cA quote of benefits or authorization does not guarantee payment or verify eligibility. Payment of benefits are subject to all terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the member\u2019s contract at time of service.\u201d This means that when you call up your health insurance company, you cannot rely on what the person tells you as a \"fact.\" It may be, or it may not be. You are required to know your own health insurance plan.\n You are expected to understand what your health insurance policy covers, and what it does not cover. This can be confusing to most people. Most people believe that if a person from your health insurance company tells you it is so, then it is a fact. Not so. You have to be a savvy consumer and know what to ask.\n\n\nMany policies state that they will pay only for treatment that they consider to be \u201cmedically necessary.\u201d This meaning that they have the right to withhold payment if it is considered outside the scope of the policy. This is true even if you have an \"authorization code.\"\n\n, Will you be seen alone, with your partner, or with other family members?\nThe \"Diagnostic Code\" is what reason the patient has for seeking treatment. It describes the focus of the treatment, even if the patient has more than one accurate diagnosis. What will your clinician be focused on helping you with? This is the Diagnostic Code.\n\nThis is the most confusing part for most people. Your insurance will pay for both spouses being in the room (Procedural Code) and the clerk on the phone will say \u201cYes, we cover couples counseling,\u201d because they see the Procedural Code \u201cCouples/Family Therapy\u201d on their computer screen. But a Procedural Code (Who\u2019s in the Room) doesn\u2019t kick out the claim. It is the Diagnostic Code that causes the claim to be rejected.\n When you read your policy, or call up your insurance company, ask specific questions:\n\n\n\"Do you cover diagnostic code V61.1 used for marriage counseling?\" You want to determine whether they consider V61.1 Relational Problems to be a medical necessity.\nSome treat code V61.1 differently than other mental disorder diagnoses. If they cover it, ask how many sessions they will cover.\nSometimes health insurance companies will cover a few sessions as \"V61.1 Relational Problems,\" and then after these sessions are used, they expect the marriage counselor to label one of you as having a diagnosable mental disorder. You have a right to decide if this will happen, when your counselor is asked to provide such a label, and what that diagnosis will be.\n Some people decide that they do not wish to be given a diagnosis of a mental disorder, other than V61.1. They will negotiate with their marriage counselor for an affordable fee, in lieu of being given this diagnosis. This is your right.\n\n\nMost will agree that marriage problems are stressful. This does not mean that you have to be given a diagnosable mental disorder to see a marriage counselor. If you are going for marriage counseling, that should be your diagnosis. If your health insurance coverage doesn't cover V61.1 Relational Problems, you can look for a better plan, or put your concerns in writing to them. Long-standing marital distress is linked to physical illness, and is nothing to take lightly. Paying now for this sort of help makes good business sense, as well as common sense.\n\n"}

There are multiple ways to invest in real estate, and you will need to evaluate your goals and finances to decide which option is best for you.\n\n\nReal estate is \"an interest in land\" (and anything permanently attached to land). This means that the real estate market is essentially about buying and selling land and buildings. There are two types of \"interest\" at work in real estate: ownership and leasehold. \"Ownership interest\" is taking full control of and responsibility for land and buildings, and \"leasehold interest\" is the granting of certain rights to a tenant in exchange for rent payment.\nThe most common form of real estate investing is purchasing ownership interest in a property and then earning money from rent paid by tenants.;\n, There are two main markets when dealing in real estate. These are the private and public markets. Any investing is risky to some extent, but each market has its own level of risk.\n\n\n\nPrivate real estate involves the purchase of an ownership interest in \"real\" (as opposed to \"personal\") property. You or a property manager would then operate that property and you would earn money on rent paid by tenants. This is a very direct way of investing in real estate because you, as the owner, are responsible for the property.\n\nPublic real estate involves purchasing shares of a publicly traded real estate company. Often these companies take the form of investment trusts. You buy shares on the market and are paid dividends as the trust collects rent and value from the multiple properties it owns. Because you only own shares in the company, you are not responsible for the real estate. This is a less direct approach to investing.\n Both the public and private markets operate on equity and debt. As an investor you pick which of those you would like to invest in.\n\n\nIf you are investing in debt, you lend money to someone so that they can buy interest in a property. You earn money in the form of interest payments on a mortgage.\nIf you are investing in equity, then you are investing in ownership of the property. This means you are assuming all responsibilities for the operation of the land and buildings.\n The four sectors are public equity, public debt, private equity, and private debt.\n\n\nIf you choose public equity, you will want to look at investment trusts. If you choose public debt, you should investigate mortgage securities, which are the debt equivalent of investment trusts, where various mortgages are bundled together to form a single investment.\nIf you select private equity, then you will most likely be purchasing residential or commercial property and acting as a landlord. If you choose private debt, you will invest in private mortgages.\n This is a variation of private equity investing, also known as flipping. The goal is to purchase a property and then turn around and resell it at a higher price.\n\n\nThese investors try to resell their properties as quickly as possible to minimize their costs of ownership.\nMost flippers will make no improvements to their properties, as they can be expensive and time-consuming. Instead, they bank on the market being favorable to them so that they can resell their unaltered property at a profit.\nA longer-term flip will see the investor improving the property in an effort to increase its value on the market. This form of investment can be labor-intensive and involve significant expenditures. Many such investors will own only one property at a time.\n\n"}

Consistency gives a child a sense of well-being, safety, and security. It teaches a child accountability for their actions, and helps provide a safe boundary for exploration.\n\n\nIf you're inconsistent, you're giving a child the information that their needs are not important to you.\nHaving regular daily routines at home will help provide a better sense of security for your child. If these routines are based in your child's needs, they'll better understand that they are valued.\n It helps to get into a routine (for example, taking a half hour walk every day after your child comes home from school). This can help ensure that you spend time with them. Set aside blocks of time where you can be with your child.\n\n\nIf you're really busy one day and don't spend much time with them, make up for it by spending more time with them on a later day.\n Modeling self-care for a child is an important aspect of teaching a child what it means to be valued. Taking care of your health, hygiene, psychological and emotional needs are all part of what it means to care for your own well-being.\n\n\nDon't remain in situations where you're abused, neglected or mistreated.\nTake time for yourself when you need it. You don't have to be constantly available at the whims of your child. If you really need some quiet time, say so, and set up the child with something they can do independently.\nIf you need help understanding more about self-care, ask for help from a friend or professional.\n For a child to feel valued, they must also feel safe. Safety comes from adults having good, healthy boundaries. The adult is responsible for providing structure and support.This doesn't mean that you can't have fun with your child. However, you must be prepared to interrupt a fun game in order to ensure that the child's safety needs are met.\nConsider your child's individual personality. Some children need more structure to feel safe than other children. It's important to meet the needs of your particular child.\n If your child is upset, respond with empathy and patience, not judgment. Ask what's wrong, and work together on brainstorming ways to make things better.\n\n\nBe gentle and firm about rules. For example, \"I know you want the purple car. The rule we set is that you can pick out one toy, and you already chose the pink car. It's your choice which car you get.\" You can empathize with the child while still expecting them to adhere to the rules.\n Let your child know that even if their behavior is unacceptable in a given situation, you still care about and love them no matter what. Everyone makes mistakes, wrong decisions, and errors in judgment. If your child is learning that they're valued, they'll be learning to make this distinction as well.Reminding them that they will have other opportunities to make better choices is one way of encouraging them to learn.\nIf your child repeatedly engages in the same negative behavior, consider what response you are providing. If you tend to engage more frequently with your child regarding negative behaviors, they may be acting out in search of your attention.\n\n"}

It results when the blue molecules in hair begin to fade and leave the yellow and orange molecules to shine through more strongly.\nPurple shampoos work by restoring blue tones to the hair, helping to prevent brassiness.;\n, The minerals in tap water can contribute to changing blonde\u2019s natural tone into a brassier color (from iron deposits) or into a greenish color (from the chlorine in the water).Installing a filter on your shower head will help prevent those color-changing minerals from being absorbed into your hair and will help keep your hair its natural shade.\n If your hair is taking on a brassy tone, make an appointment at the hair salon to have toner applied or buy toner at a drugstore and apply it yourself.Toner increases the blue and purple tones in your hair and mutes the orange and yellow ones, counteracting brassiness.\nYou can typically expect to pay about $40 or more for a toning treatment at a salon.\nA drugstore toner will typically cost around $10, but may not be as effective as a salon treatment.\n Spraying your hair down with tap or filtered water before going in the pool will help prevent it from soaking up chlorine in the pool water.Be sure the water you\u2019re spraying your hair with isn\u2019t already highly chlorinated, or it will defeat the purpose.\n If your hair begins to take on a greenish cast after swimming in a pool or because your shower water contains higher levels of copper or chlorine, you can help tone down the green by using an acidic hair rinse. An acidic hair rinse will remove the buildup left behind by styling products and mineral deposits that can cause changes in your hair color.Mix 1/2 cup (for shorter hair) to 1 cup (for longer hair) of apple cider vinegar with 16 ounces of water. After shampooing, rinse your hair with the vinegar mixture and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Rinse your hair again and style as usual.\nDissolve 6-8 aspirin tablets in a glass of warm water and rinse your hair with the solution. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then rinse out the solution."}

{"title": "How to Use Distraction As a Bipolar Coping Skill1", "summary": "choose engaging distractions.\ndo something active.\nget organized.\ntry journaling.\npractice meditation.\nchoose safe distractions.", "article": " The point of using distraction as a bipolar coping skill is that interrupts a cycle of negative thoughts and behaviors by shifting your attention somewhere else.If your alternative activity isn\u2019t something you enjoy, you won\u2019t fully engage in it, and will likely still be caught in your cycle. Choose distractions that you really enjoy or that will require your full attention.\n\n\nFor example, if you enjoy gardening, then use pruning your roses as a distraction when you\u2019re feeling irritated.\nOr, as another example, you might take a break from practicing your guitar for the recital when you notice you\u2019re getting frustrated and do some of your homework as a distraction.;\n, This is a great way to distract yourself for a lot of reasons. Being active can help you reduce stress and tension, manage your bipolar disorder, and boost your overall health. It\u2019s also an activity that you can fully immerse yourself in.\n\n\nTry taking a walk or doing some stretches for a quick distraction that can also energize you and release tension.\nParticipate in a team or partner sport like tennis, basketball, football, or lacrosse as a way to distract yourself, be fit, and socialize a bit.\n You can be productive while distracting yourself if you use the time to organize your schedule and your physical space. Getting organized is not only a way to focus your attention on something less stressful, it\u2019s also a good way to manage your bipolar in general.\n\n\nMake sure that you have your treatment information organized and easily accessible. For example, you might create a notebook containing emergency treatment information.\nOrganize your workspace so that you only have materials that you need there. Use trays, cups, baskets, etc. to help you find a home for everything.\n Keeping a journal can help you in several ways.It serves as a way to release your feelings and thoughts, keep track of important information like your triggers and signs, and document how well your treatment and coping strategies are working. Writing in your journal is also a really good way to distract yourself.\n\n\nWriting about your day may help you identify personal triggers and signs that you may need to distract yourself.\nInstead of focusing on what has you upset, focus on writing about how you are feeling, why you might feel this way, and what you can do about it.\n This is another positive and productive way to distract yourself. Meditation can help relieve physical tension, clear your mind, and calm and relax you. It\u2019s something that you can do no matter where you are. And it\u2019s also something that you can do for as long or as short a time as you need.\n\n\nMake yourself as comfortable as possible. If you can, go somewhere quiet where you can sit or lie without being disturbed.\nFocus on your breathing. Think about it as you slowly inhale through your nose, hold it in your belly, and then release it through your mouth.\nTry not to think about anything but your breathing. If your mind wanders, gently bring your thoughts back to your breathing.\n Using alcohol and drugs to distract yourself from your present situation is unhealthy, but there are other things you can do instead. In some cases you will need to distract yourself but also remain focused on what you\u2019re doing. For example, if you\u2019re driving and find yourself getting stressed because of traffic, meditating isn\u2019t the best distraction. When this happens you can still use distraction as a coping skill, you just need to do something that won\u2019t make the situation dangerous for you.\n\n\nTry deep-breathing exercises. You can do this anytime and anywhere. For instance, you can distract yourself from stand-still traffic by focusing on your breathing like you do during mediation.\nRecite a mantra. Memorize some encouraging words or even a poem or prayer that you can silently recite to yourself as a form of distraction.\nFocus on relaxing one part of your body at a time. For example, if you\u2019re in a meeting and feel tense you can distract yourself by thinking, \u201cI\u2019m relaxing my toes\u201d as you wiggle and flex your toes. Do this with each body part or until you are calmer.\n\n"}

If the label is missing or too worn to read, err on the side of caution: hand wash the garment with a gentle soap or detergent and hang or lay it to dry.\n\n\nA care label with a washing basin full of water on it means you can machine wash your item. If there is a number as well, this indicates the temperature at which to wash it.For a washing basin with a hand on it, wash the garment by hand instead of the washing machine.\nA square with a circle inside means you can tumble dry your garment as well.\nA single circle means dry clean only.\nA triangle means it\u2019s safe to use bleach.\nIf any of these symbols appear on your care label with an X or cross through them, it means you cannot use that method of cleaning.;\n, Before washing or cleaning any new fabric, you should always do a spot test on the fabric to ensure that the cleaning product you want to use won\u2019t damage the fabric in any way.\n\n\nChoose a small spot on the fabric that won\u2019t be seen, and apply a small amount of your desired cleaner to the area.Let it sit for five to 10 minutes, and blot the area with a clean, white cloth.\nCheck to see that no color bleeding, discoloration, or shrinking has occurred. Use a damp cloth to remove the cleaner.\n For tough stains or hard-to-clean dirt, spot clean the stains with soapy water, a clear alcohol like isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or vodka, or a gentle liquid laundry detergent that\u2019s been diluted in water (use a teaspoon (6 ml) of detergent in one cup (240 ml) of water). To spot clean:\n\n\nApply a small bit of cleaner to the fabric with a cloth or clean sponge.\nGently rub the area with either the sponge, a lint-free cloth, or a soft-bristled brush, such as a clean toothbrush. If you use a cloth or sponge, make sure it\u2019s white or undyed, as the dye could transfer to the fabric.\n Sometimes fabrics just don\u2019t want to come clean, but there are methods you can use to remove stubborn stains from your favorite clothes.To remove deodorant or perspiration stains, rub a small amount of liquid laundry soap into the armpit areas and let it sit for 10 minutes before washing.\nFor oil stains, lay the stain face-down on a clean wash cloth or hand towel. Pour some liquid laundry soap onto the back of the stain and let it sit. As the oil and soap soak through and dry, replace the cloth with a clean one. Rinse the area once it has dried and launder it normally.\nTo get rid of stubborn organic matter (such as food, beverages, grass, and blood), pre-treat the stains by rubbing them with a detergent that contains enzymes, such as OxiClean, Tide Stain Release, and Ultra Plus.Let it sit for 10 minutes and wash normally.\n For machine-washable items, always wash faux suede items together to prevent the material from collecting lint. Wash larger items, such as curtains and bedding, alone. To machine wash a single faux suede item, place it in a lingerie bag to separate it from the rest of the clothes in the load.\n\n\nTo be on the safe side, always use the delicate or gentle cycle and a mild liquid detergent when washing faux suede.\nTo hand wash your item, fill a large bowl or sink with warm, soapy water. Place your item in the water and let it absorb the water. Gently agitate the fabric with your hands, concentrating on areas that are particularly soiled.\n If the care label indicates that your item is safe for the dryer, follow the heat settings, or use a low- or no-heat setting to dry your faux suede.\n\n\nYou can also hang your items to dry on a clothesline, or lay them flat on a towel to dry.\n Washing faux suede can make the fabric stiff. Use a soft brush or clean toothbrush to gently brush the fabric and return its softness., Use a soft brush or cloth to remove excess dirt, dust, salt, mud, and other dry grime.\n Faux suede is a popular choice for fashion items like boots, shoes, bags, and purses, and it is possible to clean these when they are dirty. To do this, you will need:Some newspaper (for shoes)\nA soft wash cloth or cotton balls\nA mixture of equal parts water and vinegar, or plain isopropyl alcohol\n\n, Dip the wash cloth into the cleaning solution and wring out the excess water. You want it slightly damp, not soaking wet. Gently rub the fabric with the damp cloth, rinsing and re-dampening the cloth as needed, until the dirt, salt, or stains are gone.\n\n\nIf you are using alcohol instead, transfer it to a spray bottle and spray the alcohol onto a clean cloth before rubbing the fabric.\n When you are cleaning shoes, stuff them with newspaper as they dry to help them retain their shape.For bags or purses, lay them flat on a towel or hang to dry.\n\n\nIf the newspaper inside the shoes becomes damp, replace it with dry paper.\n Any faux suede item, including a fashion accessory, will become stiff after washing, so use a soft brush to brush the fabric once it\u2019s dry.\n Weekly vacuuming will keep your furniture free of crumbs, dirt, allergens, pet hair, and dust. It will also stop dirt and dust from accumulating in the fibers, and help to maintain and overall clean appearance.Vacuum the pillows, cushions, nooks, crannies, and crevices.\n Furniture tags will tell you what types of products to use for cleaning, but that\u2019s only helpful if you know what the codes mean. Most faux suede will have one of the following labels:W: clean with water-based solutions, like soapy water\nS: clean with solvent-based cleaners, like furniture spray or alcohol\nSW: clean with either water- or solvent-based cleaners\n\n, Faux suede is water resistant, meaning that when liquid gets spilled on it, the liquid will bead up so that you can wipe it away.Spills that aren\u2019t cleaned immediately will cause stains from watermarking, dyes, or food marks.\n\n\nDab, don\u2019t rub, spots with a clean, dry cloth to remove liquids and water.\nFor food spills, use a spoon or spatula to scoop up the mess right away.\nFor mud, allow it to dry before removing the clump and brushing off the dust and dirt., Choose a cleaner based on the label on your furniture and test it on the fabric in an inconspicuous area before spot cleaning elsewhere. Your best bet for a cleaner will be isopropyl alcohol in a spray bottle.\n\n\nSpray a small amount of alcohol on the soiled area, and gently rub it with a clean, undyed sponge or lint-free cloth.Blot stubborn stains if necessary, and use a clean spot on the cloth for each soiled area. Allow the area to dry before using.\nAlways use strong cleaning agents in a well-ventilated area, and never near an open flame.\nTo clean the entire piece, work in small sections using the same method. Don\u2019t forget about removable pillows and cushions.\n Because of the nature of furniture, it is sometimes bombarded with pretty nasty stuff that can stain, such as dirt, oil, and even wax. Luckily, faux suede is quite durable, and most stains can be removed without damaging the fabric.\n\n\nTo remove oil, wipe up as much of the oil as possible with an absorbent cloth or paper towel. Soak a rag in alcohol and wring out the excess. Use this cloth to blot at the oil stains, then remove the oil and dirt with a clean, dry cloth.\nTo remove wax, heat an iron on high. Lay a clean cloth over the affected area on the furniture, and gently rub the hot iron back and forth over the cloth.As the wax melts, it will be absorbed by the cloth.\nTo remove gum, apply an ice cube to the gum to freeze it. When it\u2019s very cold or frozen, gently scrape it off with a spoon or spatula.,"}

Since emails and domain names are easy to obtain, having an email address is not as trustworthy as offline contact information.Remember that both phone numbers and addresses are now super easy to fake. There is a whole industry in providing fake area code and 800 numbers. Even Google now does this, so phone numbers are no longer a sign of a real company. Before doing business, call the local chamber of commerce associated with the address and see if they are a real bricks and mortar company, or simply a referral skimming internet company with a phony address.\nSearch in other cities to see if a supposedly \"local business\" is using the same website for operations in other localities. You should be wary if you find the same supposedly local business page being used for another location. Usually these copied phony business web pages are used in many cities and are just copied templates. Many have broken hyperlinks for images and links, which is a tip-off that this may be a phony phishing business page.;\n, If a website says one thing in one spot, and then contradicts itself in another spot, that's a red flag that the business is not coordinated and may be a scam that was hastily thrown together. If the website is unprofessional (for example, there are stolen images and numerous spelling errors), this shows that little thought or care was put into creating the website, which could indicate a \"get rich quick\" scam. , Legitimate companies will almost always have terms of use or terms and conditions pages, as well as privacy policy pages. If they do have terms and privacy policies, read through them carefully suspicious sounding language.\n Phony referral business sites usually don't have much content on their sites and usually have lots of legitimate company and BBB logos on their site to trick you into trusting them. A 'big' tip-off are stock photos or no photos of the company building, employees, or products. Avoid the company if all you see are stock photos of their so-called product, which is one of the easiest way to spot a fake web business!\n\n, It\u2019s a red flag when a company\u2019s website says they only accept payments through insecure or shady methods, such as only by paper check or cash. This is because PayPal and other secondary electronic payment providers are often considered the safest method for paying online businesses. Look into payment methods which will allow you to get your money back if things go sour and do not require the release of unnecessary personal information."}

More than anything, a person with martyr syndrome longs for recognition and approval from those around him or her., Continuing to suffer, rather than fixing the problem, is a common symptom of those who are in an abusive or harassing relationship. They stay with the person causing them pain because they think that they can change the person\u2019s ways with their unselfish behavior. Even if they have the choice of getting out of their bad situation, they choose to stay in it because they think it is more noble to suffer and if they leave the situation, they may be viewed as selfish.For example, a woman may stay with an abusive husband for two reasons. One would be that she thinks it is her duty to fix him and their relationship, so she suffers in order to be unselfish and mend his ways. The second reason may be that she chooses to stay because she does not want her children to live in a disturbed home. Because of this, she chooses to suffer rather than letting her children suffer, as she thinks they would do if she were to leave her husband.\n People with martyr syndrome often select someone to be his or her role model. This role model is generally someone who chose to suffer rather than confront a situation in order to achieve a goal of some kind. Because of this role model, the person is ruled by thoughts of others and puts themselves on a pedestal of for having taken up the task of rendering selfless services for the sake of others.\n People with martyr syndrome often look and act unhappy because they feel that their sacrifices are underappreciated. A person with martyr syndrome will often feel like the person she has sacrificed for does not really how instrumental she has been in the person\u2019s success.\n\n\nThe person will mostly talk about how difficult life has been for her because she has had to sacrifice so much for the benefit of others. She will never talk about other options that she could have chosen to remedy the situation.\n The person will often remind the person that he sacrificed for that he deserves acknowledgement and appreciation. Even the slightest display of an attitude that they take to be less than respectful will be taken as an insult. Because of this, the person will get offended easily and will be set off by the slightest of triggers.An example of something that a person with martyr syndrome might say would sound like s \u2018I did so much for them so the least they could do is involve me in every aspect of their life, in every decision they make. They owe me their respect and acknowledgement for my services to them.\u201d\n\n, The person will always talk about himself as a person who chose to suffer because of a noble cause. He will act as if he is constantly chased by a nagging feeling that people who have benefited from his sacrifices just do not recognize and acknowledge his selfless contributions and services.\n\n\nThe person will also does not hesitate in voicing his displeasure to anyone that is willing to listen. He would like as many people as possible to know how unfortunate he is for having gotten the short end of the stick because of his acts of sacrifice.\n People with martyr syndrome expect others to admire them for their selfless spirit. They greatly enjoy being showered with sympathy for the dreams and aspirations they put aside so that they could benefit someone else.\n\n\nIf anyone tries to challenge the person\u2019s intentions, or points out that the person did not have to sacrifice everything, the person will become very upset and angry. A normal response is to claim that the challenger is selfish, ungrateful, and has no idea what the person\u2019s life has been life.\n When a person with martyr syndrome is in the process of fixing someone else\u2019s life, she will refuse any help, or deem any help that she does get as insignificant in the full scheme of things. She will not listen to advice or suggestions because she thinks that everything that happens is because of her--no one else had a hand in any of the changes that were made.\n\n\nWherever possible, the person with martyr syndrome will paint the picture like she was the only one to shoulder any burden in the situation, even if other people helped, or the situation didn\u2019t really need to be fixed in the first place.\n The person will love you and shower you with affection, but in return he will ask for your own outward displays of love and respect. Unsaid actions of love don\u2019t satisfy people with martyr syndrome--they need the most overt forms of expression.They will expect you to talk about their sacrifices and unselfishness to everyone that you come into contact with. They will also expect gifts that show how much you appreciate them.\n\n"}

Tidal rivers, estuaries, harbours and canals are all good places to find mullet. They are often close to the surface and in big schools, so if they are there, you should be able to spot them.\n\n\nThey are often found in big groups on a rising tide as they feed on algae., You don't need elaborate tackle to go after mullet. Just be sure to have a light rod with a click-drag reel. You will need long leaders with a 6lbs test strength as well as fine diameter lines to counter the mullet's excellent eyesight., Baiting for a mullets can be a tricky task, with all sorts of baits recommended and discouraged. No bait is every a certainty, and this is especially the case for the algae and invertebrate feeding mullet. There are a number of baiting options that have been successful for you to consider and experiment with. These include:\n\n\nRagworm.Bread or dough.\nPeeled prawn., Given that mullets gather in schools near the surface, using a fly can be good way to fish them. You'll need a small fly, and don't expect a bright flashy lure will work on the bottom feeding mullets. Try tossing some clumps of oatmeal into the water and casting in front of the mullet as they feed.A bread and oatmeal batter mix can be effective when fly fishing for mullet.\n Once you've got a bite, you'll soon discover that despite their relatively modest size, mullets are fighters on the hook. Take care as you reel them in, don't try to pull them in too quickly. You can consider using a landing net for the final catch.\n\n\nUsing a braid line will help you feel the movements of the mullet in the water.Remember that mullets can really leap up out of water, so take extra care when landing them or they could jump off and away.\n\n"}

Prepare your child\u2019s outfit, hair and makeup before taking the photos. These photographers edit and enhance headshots with special software in keeping with glitz pageant expectations.\n\n\nRead reviews online to find a good photographer. Ask to see examples of their work before deciding on the right photographer for you.\nSend the headshots to the pageant organizers as per the rules of the pageant.\n Look for a pageant coach who is familiar with child glitz pageantry. Expect to pay about $100 an hour for lessons from an experienced coach. Ask the coach for advice on a stage walk, cute poses, and all-around styling.You may also want to enroll your child in specific talent classes, such as voice or dance lessons.\n Use your creativity to come up with props, and make sure they are allowed at the pageant. You may want to incorporate backdrop pieces into the routine. Make the prop(s) relevant to the song or routine.\n\n\nFor example, if the routine is about a fairy tale, you may want a large cardboard castle or a fake carriage.\nPageants may ban props that can affect the stage or audience, such as bubble machines or live animals.\n Come up with music, dances, and poses for each performance. Have your child practice about an hour a day, beginning a month before the pageant.Don\u2019t pressure your child to practice, or the idea of the pageant can become a chore instead of a fun pastime.\nConsider making a practice chart with stickers and potential rewards for practicing, to encourage preparation in a positive way.\n Begin looking for outfits as early as six months before a pageant. Choose outfits with color and style that compliment your child. Make sure that the outfits are age-appropriate. Have your child try on the outfits ahead of time to ensure they aren\u2019t too long, short, tight or loose.Consider which colors look best with your child\u2019s eyes, hair color and skin tone.\nFor example, dresses and gowns should be sweet and cute, not sexy or revealing.\nGirls under ten wear cupcake dresses with ruffles and lots of shiny stones. Girls over ten wear long ball gowns. Boys wear suits or tuxedos.\nShop online or visit a prom or pageant dress shop. Expect that you will probably need to have alterations made, which can take weeks.\n Visit a dentist or orthodontist who can make a flipper for your child. Have your child try the flipper on ahead of time in case it needs to be adjusted. Keep the flipper well cleaned, and don\u2019t allow your child to eat or sleep with it on.A flipper is made of acrylic resin and costs about $300 to $500 for a full set. Alternately, you can purchase just a top or bottom flipper for half the cost.You may want a flipper if your child has missing, damaged or very crooked teeth.\n Purchase false lashes and hairpieces, if desired. Look for a hairpiece with real hair, as synthetic hairpieces tend to look fake. Have your child try on the hairpiece beforehand to make sure its shade blends well with their natural hair color. Hire your own hair and makeup artist, or make plans to utilize one who is working for the pageant.\n\n\nKeep in mind that makeup and hair professionals working for the pageant are on a tight schedule and may have issues getting everyone prepared on time. If you want to avoid that stress, bring your own artist who is informed about glitz pageant makeup and hairstyles., Get your child\u2019s nails done before the pageant, if desired. For glitz pageants, contestants usually get a spray tan as well. Alternately, you can do your child\u2019s nails and tan yourself.\n Book a room in the hotel where the pageant is being held. Even if you live nearby, it\u2019s a good idea to have a room where your child can prepare, as well as take a nap if needed. Plan to arrive early or the night before so that you can set up your child\u2019s stuff in the room and take your time.\n\n\nFind out what the hotel\u2019s check-in and check-out times are.\n Understand that pageant schedules are intense. Prepare to begin getting ready early in the morning and continue pageant activities until well into the afternoon. Bring water and healthy snacks like bananas.Have your child go to sleep early the night before the pageant.\nAllow your child to nap during breaks if he or she is tired.\n Expect judges to give better scores to kids who are truly enjoying themselves on stage. Emphasize happiness and animation more than moves and cues.If your child messes up, don't be angry. Try saying, \"You were great! You look so nice, and I\u2019m very proud of you.\"\n\n, Avoid making obvious gestures or statements while your child is on stage. Judges often deduct points when they notice obvious coaching, and/or a child focusing solely on a coach.\n\n\nYou and your child can agree upon a subtle signal to boost confidence, such as a thumbs up.\n Applaud for other contestants. Keep a positive attitude. Give other families and contestants the same respect and encouragement you would want for your child.\n Expect to pay at least $400 to $500 for a glitz pageant. You could pay over $3,500 to prepare for such a pageant. Consider entering a natural pageant or involving your child in a different activity if the cost of a glitz pageant will put you into debt.Glitz pageant entry fees alone range from $50 to $500.\nAdditional costs include travel expenses, outfits, styling and coaching/talent lessons.\nGlitz pageant dresses are expensive and often custom-made., Don\u2019t place unrealistic expectations on your child, such as to perform perfectly or to win the top title. Make sure that your motivation isn\u2019t to satisfy your own need for success through your child. Focus on goals that will promote good mental health for your child. Evaluate whether you are able to instruct your child with positive, gentle encouragement.Healthy goals for children are unconditional love, play time with other kids, self-confidence, and encouraging teachers.It\u2019s unhealthy for parents to desire financial benefits or social recognition through their child\u2019s performance., Expect that you may encounter critics. You could potentially face backlash, particularly if the pageant is televised. Make a conscious decision to keep your child\u2019s performance age-appropriate by choosing outfits, music, and dance moves that are acceptable for children.Many critics consider swimsuit poses and competitions to be especially inappropriate for young kids.Some critics have a strong belief that glitz pageants sexualize children and encourage superficial values.\n\n"}

They are consistent within the game.\n\n\nJokers are with 50 points\n2's and Aces are 20 points\n8's through Kings are 10 points\n4's through 7's are five points\nBlack 3's are used as \"block\" cards; when discarded, the next player cannot pick up the pile for that turn. Black 3's can be placed down for points if and only if the player is going out and has no other card in his or her hand to be discarded. When used in this manner, black 3's are worth five points\n\nThe value of the meld is determined by the rank of the card within the meld. What's a meld, you ask?\n\n;\n, A meld is a group of cards (3 minimum) that each have the same rank. The initial meld in a hand must be worth at least 50 points (though this value increases as the game progresses. Upon reaching 1,500 points, the player must have a meld of at least 90. At 3,000 points, the player must have a meld of 120). Melds can include several groups of cards. For example, if you need to have a meld of 90 for a hand, and you have three 5's, 7's, and aces, you can place all of these cards down for a total of 90 points. Once you have your first meld down, you're free to meld in whatever combinations you see fit.\n\n\nEach meld must have a least two natural cards (no wilds, etc.)\nJokers and 2's are wild and can be any value (except 3's)\nA meld of 7 is a \"Canasta.\" They must have at least 4 natural cards. A natural Canasta has no wilds and is worth 500 points, as opposed to a \"dirty\" Canasta, which has at least one wild card in it and is worth 300 points.\n They are treated as bonus cards, and are scored separately from melds at 100 points each. If a player has a red 3 in his or her hand, it must be laid on the table at the start of his turn, and the player draws a replacement card from the draw pile in addition to the regular draw of two cards he or she just made. If a player draws a red 3 from the draw pile, it is laid on the table and the player draws another card. Failure to do so penalizes a team 500 points.\n\n\nMelds cannot be made of red 3's, though if you have 7, you're pretty set.\n This ends the hand. When you get rid of all your cards (after you have at least two Canastas), it is known as \"going out.\" If you have a partner, you must ask them if you can go out. If they say \"no,\" the game must continue.\n\n\nIf you can go out all on one turn (getting rid of all your cards in one go), that is known as a \"concealed hand.\" This is worth 200 points, instead of going out on the regular, which is just 100.\n\n"}

Kate studied hard and did well on her exams in England, and she went on to study at the University of St. Andrews, where she met Prince William. Therefore, if you want to be like Kate, study hard and try to get into a good university., As noted, Kate got her undergraduate degree at the University of St. Andrews, a degree in art history. Therefore, to be more like Kate, you should encourage your own interest in art. Try taking an art history class at a local community college, for instance, or visiting your local art museum. You can also check out books from the library on art history., Kate has always been the picture of discreetness. She kept her relationship with the Prince secret for several years, mostly because he didn't want the press involved., Even amidst all the royal protocol, Kate and William often strive for a normal life. In fact, for the first two years of their marriage, they lived in a farmhouse out in the woods so they could enjoy each other's company. So while Kate may be a Duchess, she still very down-to-earth. Strive for being down-to-earth in your own life by grounding yourself in your family life.While living in the farmhouse, Kate often shopped and cooked for William, for instance., As a royal, Kate has many duties she must fulfill, usually backing up the Queen at royal events. She does what is expected of her as a royal. You, in turn, should fulfill what is expected of you by your family if you intend to copy Kate.While Kate's duties might be attending a royal event, your duties are more likely to look like showing up for a family event, preparing dinner for your family, or being there when you're needed.\n Kate has always been athletic. In high school, she played tennis, field hockey, and participated in track events such as the long jump. She continued playing field hockey in college. To model yourself after Kate, get involved in a sport.You can choose a sport to play at school, or you can check with your local parks and recreation department to see what sports leagues they offer. Many departments have leagues ranging from toddlers to adults.\nOut of school, Kate typically runs, often with William, to stay in shape., Kate has always shown integrity when it comes to the royal family. For instance, when Kate and William split up in 2007, she didn't pass on any secrets about William or the family to the media. She kept that information to herself, even when she could have made some money off of it., Kate is always perfectly on point when it comes to etiquette. While proper etiquette does involve things like knowing who to curtsy to, it's also a lot more than that. It's more about being gracious to the people around you, and making them feel like they are welcome.For instance, when you host a dinner party, proper etiquette would dictate that you don't point out the fact that someone is slurping their food. You want to make your guests feel like they can do no wrong.However, it doesn't hurt to learn the proper rules for dining, as well. For instance, the proper way to stir tea (the British way) is to gently move your spoon back and forward in your teacup without clinking the sides., When standing, Kate always has perfect posture, and she doesn't give that up when she sits down, either. Kate keeps her back straight. She also doesn't rest on the back of the chair or the armrest. Instead, she keeps a small amount of space between her back and the chair back, crosses her ankles, and keeps her hands neatly folded in her lap.Also, make sure your chin stays up, so that it is parallel to the ground, not slouched over."}

Different figures of syllogisms will be described in a following step. For now, simply understand that you can label each part of syllogism \u2013 including each premise and the conclusion \u2013 according to which type of proposition they make to identify the syllogism\u2019s mood.For instance, consider a categorical syllogism with the mood of AAA: \u201cAll X are Y. All Y are Z. So, all X are Z.\nA mood refers only to the types of propositions employed in a syllogism of standard order \u2013 major premise, minor premise, conclusion \u2013 and may be the same for two different forms based on the figure of the syllogisms in question.\n A syllogism\u2019s figure is determined by whether the middle term serves as subject or predicate in the premises. Recall that a subject is what the sentence is about, and the predicate is a word that applies to the subject of the sentence.In a first figure syllogism, the middle term serves as subject in the major premise and predicate in the minor premise: \"All birds are animals. All parrots are birds. All parrots are animals\".\nIn a second figure syllogism, the middle term serves as predicate in the major premise and predicate in the minor premise. For instance: \"No foxes are birds. All parrots are birds. No parrots are foxes.\"\nIn a third figure syllogism, the middle term serves as subject in the major premise and subject in the minor premise. For instance: \"All birds are animals. All birds are mortals. Some mortals are animals.\"\nIn a fourth figure syllogism, the middle term serves as predicate in the major premise and subject in the minor premise. For instance: \"No birds are cows. All cows are animals. Some animals are not birds.\"\n\n, Although there are 256 mathematically possible forms of syllogisms \u2013 since there are 4 possible variations (A/E/I/O) for each part of a syllogism, and 4 different figures of syllogisms \u2013 only 19 forms are logically valid.For first figure syllogisms, the valid forms are AAA, EAE, AII, and EIO.\nFor second figure syllogisms, the valid forms are EAE, AEE, EIO, and AOO.\nFor third figure syllogisms, the valid forms are AAI, IAI, AII, EAO, OAO, and EIO.\nFor fourth figure syllogisms, the valid forms are AAI, AEE, IAI, EAO, and EIO.\n\n"}

Its best to proceed with a clear mind and an awareness of the implications of the process.\n\n\nIf the child is not yet born, your situation may be the simplest. Most states require couples to complete an Acknowledgement of Paternity form in the hospital, which is later filed with the Bureau of Vital Statistics along with the birth certificate. Before signing the form, if you doubt that you are the father of the child, you can request a test be performed in the hospital after the baby is born, though either a cheek swab or a sample of cord blood.Postnatal testing can be done if you were listed on the birth certificate but doubt you are the father OR if you believe you are the father but were not listed on the certificate.\nIf the baby is already born and the certificate already filed, circumstances might arise that cause you to doubt that a child you are supporting is your biological child. In this case, do you have reasons to doubt that the child is biologically yours?\nIn other situations, you might believe a child is biologically yours but are not acknowledged as the father by the child's mother. In this case, do you have reasons to believe that the child is biologically yours?\n\n, Although it can vary, most women have a 28 day cycle (with Day 1 being the first day of her period). This means they are only fertile from about Days 10-17.Its important to keep in mind that hard-and-fast rules about fertility always have exceptions, and babies have been unexpectedly conceived at all times of the month, even during a woman's period itself.Its also important to remember that birth control pills, condoms, or other preventative measures are not always successful. Using them does not guarantee that a pregnancy won't occur, just as not using them does not guarantee that it will.\n These reasons can be based on her own self-interests, the interests she perceives for her child, or protecting someone else's feelings. Understanding her reasons might go a long way in convincing her to allow a paternity test.\n\n\nShe may not know who the father is, and may be embarrassed, afraid, or reluctant to make that information known. This can be for a number of reasons, including fear of public scrutiny, privacy concerns, or even concerns for her own safety. Especially in cases of sexual assault, a woman might not know or want to know who the father of her child is.\nShe might worry that disclosing paternity might damage a current relationship. For instance, this might be the case if you are her partner but not the father of her child; or alternately, if you are not her partner but you are the father, she may worry that her current partner will be upset by the news that he is not the father.\n Regardless of whether or not your concerns about paternity seem well founded, if you are having doubts, it is often best to know definitively either way. Determining paternity is beneficial for the father, mother, and child.\n\n\nPaternity testing can secure your parental rights. If a child is yours, under most circumstances you can secure your right to participate in that child's life (through visitation, financial support, or even custody in some cases).\nPaternity testing can also help you avoid taking responsibility for a child if it is not yours. If a woman claims you are the father but does not want to provide proof, a paternity test is the only definitive way to prove if you are *not* that child's father, and thus not obligated to provide for it or fulfill your parental obligations.\nConfirmation of paternity is also in the best interest of the child. It can reinforce the relationship between a father and child, provide a social and financial safety net, provide legal benefits for the child such as inheritance rights, and ensure that the child's medical history is accurate.\n Even though determining paternity is most often the best choice, it can still have very real and lasting psychological and emotional effects. Knowing what these might be can help you deal with them as they arise.\n\n\nWhether the child is or is not yours, the results of the test will alter the rest of your life. Be sure that you have a support system (friends, family, trusted mentors, or counselors) in place to help you deal with the results of the test, whether those results are what you hoped for or not.\n\n"}

The line can be curved or straight -- it doesn't matter. Think of it as how much the line is changing at any time, instead of the slope of the entire line. How you take derivatives changes depending on the type of function you have, so review how to take common derivatives before moving on.\n\n\nReview taking derivatives here\n\nThe most simple derivatives, those for basic exponential equations, are easy to find using a simple shortcut. This will be used for the rest of the method.\n You will not always be asked to explicitly find the derivative or slope of a curve. You might also be asked for the \"rate of change at point (x,y). You could be asked for an equation for the slope of the graph, which simply means you need to take the derivative. Finally, you may be asked for \"the slope of the tangent line at (x,y).\" This, once again, just wants the slope of the curve at a specific point, (x,y).\n\nFor this method, consider the question: \"What is the slope of the line f(x)=2x2+6x{\\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x} at the point (4,2)?\"The derivative is often written as f\u2032(x),y\u2032,{\\displaystyle f'(x),y',} or dydx{\\displaystyle {\\frac {dy}{dx}}}, You don't even really need you graph, just the function or equation for your graph. For this example, use the function from earlier, f(x)=2x2+6x{\\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x}. Following the methods outlined here, take the derivative of this simple function.\n\n\nDerivative: f\u2032(x)=4x+6{\\displaystyle f'(x)=4x+6}\n\n\n, The differential of a function will tell you the slope of the function at a given point. In other words, f\u2019(x) is slope of the function at any point (x,f(x)) So, for the practice problem:\n\nWhat is the slope of the line f(x)=2x2+6x{\\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x} at the point (4,2)?\n\n\nDerivative of Equation:\n\n\nf\u2032(x)=4x+6{\\displaystyle f'(x)=4x+6}\n\n\n\n\nPlug in Point for x:\n\n\nf\u2032(x)=4(4)+6{\\displaystyle f'(x)=4(4)+6}\n\n\n\n\nFind the Slope:\n\nThe slope of the f(x)=2x2+6x{\\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x} at (4,2) is 22.\n Know that not all points in calculus will have a slope. Calculus gets into complex equations and difficult graphs, and not all points will have a slope, or even exist on every graph. Whenever possible, use a graphing calculator to check the slope of your graph. If you can't, draw the tangent line using your point and the slope (remember -- \"rise over run\") and note if it looks like it could be correct.\n\nTangent lines are just lines with the exact same slope as your point on the curve. To draw one, go up (positive) or down (negative) your slope (in the case of the example, 22 points up). Then move over one and draw a point. Connect the dots, (4,2) and (26,3) for your line.\n\n\n"}

Having it overhead will flatten the scene and make it very unremarkable.\n Take them earlier or later in the day. The angle of the sun will introduce more texture and interest to your photographs.\n Set your exposure reading on the brightest part of the photograph. This will keep you from overexposing your shot.\n Hedge your bets by bracketing your photographs. This will allow you to create an HDR photograph, if you desire, later.\n Either of these will prevent your camera from being shaken when you push the button to take the picture.

When it's too dark around you, your body thinks, \"Hey! It's time to hit the hay!\" Fool it by turning on plenty of lights, simulating daytime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove yourself from all distractions. That means putting your phone away. You may have spent the entire semester texting during lectures, and this may be your punishment. Turn it off. While you're at it, stay away from the iPad and laptop, too (unless you have study material on your computer) -- Facebook, fantasy baseball, and Pinterest do not exist in your book right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, You may think 16 cans of cold Red Bull and five Snickers bars are the best way to go, but, sadly, they're not. Hyping yourself up on caffeine may keep you awake initially, but you'll just end up crashing harder later -- when it's actually test time.\n\n\nGo for fruits. An apple does a better job at keeping you focused and awake than caffeine.It's higher in natural sugars and it is nutritious. Nutrition should be thought of as energy in this circumstance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're full, you won't be thinking about food, another reason you'll be able to stay focused.\n Alright, so, worse comes to worst: You wake up in a pile of apple cores with ink emblazoned onto your cheek because you fell asleep on your chemistry notes. But you remembered to set your alarm, so you're not going to miss the test!\n\n\nSo do it now, before you accidentally fall asleep. You may be grateful that you did.\n This part may be hard but just take a deep breath and try to gather your thoughts! Remember where you left all those textbooks and gather together some spare pieces of paper and pens. Highlighters and flashcards are also a good idea.\n\n\nIf you still have your syllabus, great. Use it as an outline. The topics that pop up more than once are likely to be on the test.\n Concentrate on the bigger picture -- highlight the important facts that you think could be on the test. Also remember to look closely at the vocabulary! It will obviously help your understanding if you know what a word means.\n\n\nRead the chapter summaries (they usually do a good job at summarizing the important points). If there are no chapter summaries, then skim through the text and write down key ideas.\n This is the most important part of cramming. You have a very limited amount of time -- you must use it as efficiently as possible. Get down to the nitty-gritty and only study what you think is worthy of being on the test.\n\n\nFocus on the main ideas and learn key formulas. Skip the details for now and only come back to them if you see that you have time after you have learned the key points.\nDon't attempt to learn everything; focus on things that will get you the most points on the exam. If your professor said the essay will be 75% of your grade, you're best off preparing for that and skipping the multiple choice.\n This will help your brain process the material better. If you just skim your textbooks or notes you probably won't remember anything!\n\n\nIf you're lucky enough to have an insomniac for a roommate, grab them. Ask them to listen to you spout off about certain concepts. Relaying information to another individual is a surefire way to guarantee you understand the ins and outs of the ideas., This is a good way to quiz yourself and it also helps you process the information when you write out the flashcards and read them out loud! Use different colors for different topics or chapters.\n\n\nLook for parallels, metaphors, and other memory-triggers to help you wrap your brain around complicated concepts.Write the keywords of your metaphor down to jog your memory while studying.\nWrite the information down in mnemonic devices. Dumb Kids Playing Catch On Freeway Get Squashed --Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species (for a happy example).\n It may seem counter-intuitive, but your brain will be able to process more information if you're not so hard on it. Study in bursts -- cramming like the Energizer bunny is inefficient and saturates your mind, preventing it from taking in more. Though you're studying a bit less, you'll be retaining more.After 45 minutes or so, get up. Stretch your body and walk around. Grab a drink, get a snack, and hop back to it in 5 to 10 minutes. You should feel a bit more refreshed and ready for action.\n If you stay up all night you will be so tired in the morning chances are you won't remember anything! Get up in the morning about 30-45 minutes earlier and familiarize yourself with the highlighted parts of your notes and textbooks. If you made flashcards, go through them again.\n\n\nTry to get in at least 3 hours; that's one full sleep cycle.Waking up in the middle of one less than well-rested will be detrimental to your test score.\n You've heard from everybody that a nutritious meal before an exam will help you use your brain better. Stick to a fairly normal breakfast (you don't want to get sick) and don't load up on anything too heavy if you have anxiety.\n\n\nThink about this: The more food you eat before your exam, the less you will be thinking about how hungry you are, so help yourself by just eating something before your exam so you can stay at least somewhat focused.\n Go through the information a couple of times on your way to school. Chances are if you paid attention in class and got in some good studying the night before you should be fine.\n There's 5 minutes before the teacher walks in, so utilize them! Take turns asking each other questions. Start with the points you are foggiest on -- that way they'll be fresh in your memory.\n\n\nDon't do this while you're taking the test -- getting caught cheating will result in a much worse score than you were going to get if you hadn't.\n\n"}

This can not only damage the skin, but also cause infection. Try to deter him from doing this. You can try disciplining him if he starts to bother the stitches; it may also be necessary to put a muzzle on him.If you have to, have your dog wear a cone collar to prevent him from bothering his stitches until they are healed. Make sure to leave it on for the duration of the healing process. If you take it on and off, your dog might start rebelling when you try to place it on him.You might have to leave it on for up to two weeks.\nYou can also get a neck brace, which makes a dog unable to turn his head. This might help if the cone collar is getting in the way.;\n, Once the wound starts healing, it may start to itch, which means your dog will want to scratch. If this is the case, try to deter this behavior. Sometimes, the cone collar can help. If it doesn\u2019t, then cover the stitches with gauze or bandages. Keep supervising your dog to make sure she\u2019s not scratching them.You can also put booties or wraps on her paws and claws to keep the wound from getting hurt.\nScratching can rip open the stitches and the wound. Dirt and bacteria on the dog's nails can also infect the wound.\nScratching and rubbing can also cause swelling. If the wound swells too much, it might cause the stitches to break.\n Make sure the dog doesn\u2019t get muddy or get the incision dirty. This can cause infection or other complications. This means keeping him from going outside on his own or letting him roam around muddy or wooded areas.Don\u2019t apply ointment, cream, disinfectants, or anything else without your vet\u2019s permission. Don\u2019t use solutions like hydrogen peroxide or alcohol because it can harm the healing process.\nYou should change the dressing according to your vet\u2019s orders.\nMake sure the dog\u2019s bed is clean. Place a clean sheet or towel on the bed each night and replace when it becomes even lightly soiled.\n Do not bathe your dog during the recovery period. The incision and stitches shouldn\u2019t get wet. Moisture can encourage bacteria to multiply and cause an infection. In addition, moisture softens the skin, which makes it a less effective barrier against infection.\n\n\nTo keep the stitches and bandages dry when the dog goes outside, place a plastic bag or plastic clingwrap around the area when she goes outside. Just remove it as soon as the dog comes back inside., If there are no bandages, then look at the stitches a couple of times a day. This helps you notice changes or infections. This is very important for the healing of your dog.The healing wound should look clean with the edges touching each other. You may see some bruising around the incision, and the incision might be slightly redder than the skin around it.The incision might be slightly puffy or raised. Minor seepage, like a drop of clear or blood-stained fluid, may occur. However, if you notice abnormal swelling, steady seepage, thick discharge, or yellow-green discharge, contact your vet.\nLook for any swelling, heated skin, odor, discharge, irritation, or new damage., If you can\u2019t keep the dog from licking or touching the stitches, you can cover the stitches. If the stitches are on the dog\u2019s torso, try putting a t-shirt on him. Make sure it\u2019s cotton, so it will breathe. Just make sure the t-shirt fits the dog and isn\u2019t too large or too tight. You can tie the shirt to keep it from moving up the dog\u2019s torso.This is helpful if you have multiple dogs and can\u2019t keep them separated.\nYou can also cover the stitches with a bandage. This might be necessary if the wound is on a limb.\nIf the dog scratches at the wound with a back leg, try putting a snug-fitting sock on that paw so the nails can\u2019t rip at the stitches."}

You can wash the kale by holding it under running water or by immersing the kale into a bowl of clean, cold water.\n\n\nIt is also a good idea to check the leaves for bugs, especially if you purchased the kale from a farm stand or market. You can still eat the kale after you remove a bug from it, just make sure that you rinse it well.\n You will also want to trim the kale to remove the tough ends of the stems. Cut off the ends of the kale stems and then chop your kale as desired.\n\n\nDepending on the variety of kale you are using, you might want to cut off the stems altogether.

Instead of sitting in a classroom for eight hours a day they are able to have interactive projects and constant learning opportunities.Unschooling is incredibly adaptive, as it changes and moves with the child and goes at the child's pace. It teaches children that learning happens constantly, not within a rigid structure of 'facts' and tests, but in a natural, non-stressful environment. There is no doing school since you are learning all the time.\nGiving children the opportunity and the resources for learning on their own gives them greater independence and a greater ability to take charge for themselves and to make decisions for themselves.\nRegular public school tends to be a space more for showing off and for artificial boundaries drawn based on class, race, and gender that perpetuate in children behaviors and boundaries which are already problematic in the wider culture. Most children learn little more than how to work within a system that does not even treat them as people (many students have stories about cheating on tests, lying to avoid getting in trouble, and so on).;\n, Unschooling means that both the parent(s) and the child have to take charge of learning. This does not mean that the parent is responsible for becoming the 'teacher,' so to speak, but to be an active, participant in their child's learning.This means doing interesting projects, looking up answers to a child's questions with the child (like: why is the sky blue?).\nThere are a variety of good books and helpful spaces for parents who are unschooling their children, that can help give them ideas and deal with difficult times. Books like John Holt's Teach Your Ownor Grace Llewellyn's The Teenage Liberation Handbook. Or check out the Self Made Scholar's unschooling reading list., Unschooling means constant learning. It sounds tiring, but really all that means is rather than setting aside a specific time to sit down to memorize some facts, your child is constantly being exposed to the world and the learning opportunities it provides.\n\n\nYou will start to figure out both how you, and your child, learn things and it will take some trial and error to find the most useful ways for your child to learn, since there is no one right way to learn.\n You may think that a child who is being unschooled won't get into college (and that the same problem applies to homeschooled children as well), but this is actually not true. Of course, not everyone wants or needs to go to college, but many do.Universities and colleges like Harvard, MIT, Duke, Yale, and Stanford are actually actively looking for students who have had alternate learning experiences, because those types of students tend to earn more credits than regular students and tend to do better, since they have more often been exposed to self-motivated learning.\nMany colleges have adjusted their admissions policies so that it is easier for these types of students to apply.\nThe most important things to do if you're an unschooler who wants to go to college are to keep good records of your work, make sure you know and meet the deadlines for things like the SAT and submitting applications, and focus on your application essay.\n The point of unschooling is to focus on the child's learning and where that interest takes them. It can take awhile for them to want to do reading or mathematics, but if they are allowed to work at their own pace they are more likely to learn for themselves and the retain that information.Encourage their natural interest in things. If they show an interest in cooking, find some fun cooking experiments and try them together, or let the child try them on their own. Cooking can teach all kinds of things, like mathematics (with fractions and amounts) as well as being a practical skill.\nIf your child likes to make up stories, do creative writing projects and talk about the different characters in their own games and in the stories that they (and you) might be reading. They'll learn about characterization, about writing skills and they'll be having fun.\nIf they want to learn more intensively about a subject you don't know about, there are some really good free online courses that they can participate in, like Khan Academyand the Self Made Scholar.You can also find free online college courses on the Open Culture database., This is one of the most fun and exciting parts about unschooling. You and your child get to have lots of different, creative opportunities to learn about the world.\n\n\nCheck the museums in your area. Many museums have days where they are free, or are free for children and it can be a fun outing. Also, many of the bigger museums have their catalog online, so even if you can't physically go to a museum, you can still look at amazing and interesting things.\nLibraries are great learning resources. They often have projects going on and reading groups and lectures, beyond simply having a lot of interesting books! Check out your library's events calendar to see what's happening and talk to your child about what they might be interested in.\nIf your child is interested in something and you know someone who has the right skills, see if you can have your child learn from them for a day, or a week, or even a couple times a month. This could be anything from a chef, to a chemistry professor, to an archaeologist. Not only will this provide the child with new knowledge it's also a great way for them to see other viewpoints and to be more involved in the adult world., Since you'll be looking for lots of fun and creative ways to learn, using different games and projects can be a great way to help facilitate learning.\n\n\nDiscover the what the ecosystem is like in your area. For example, if you live near a the ocean, learn about marine animals and different kinds of water ecosystems. If you can, take a trip to them beach to look for shells and sea creatures.\nIf you can get a hold of a telescope, or make one, you can use that to look at the night sky and talk about the stars. You can even use this as a way to talk about mythology using the constellations as a jumping off point.\nUsing a microscope, examine dirt from your backyard and from the park and compare them. Talk about why there are differences in the soils and what could cause them.\n It is incredibly important that you take the time to answer questions with your child. You don't have to be an expert in every subject, but when they ask a question, sit down with them to find out the answer.\n\n\nYou can even point them in the direction of an encyclopedia (or the internet) and tell them to look it up and then tell you. If they can't figure out in ten minutes, work with them to find the answer.\nIf there is no answer, or no one right answer, you can discuss why that is and talk about ways of trying to figure the answer out for yourselves. For instance, you can talk about what gravity is and how no one knows the exact cause. You could even do experiments with gravity (since, who doesn't love throwing things off a high building).\n Sometimes you have to deschool before you unschool. This is often especially important if your child has been in the public school system for a while. Deschooling means giving them a break, for a few weeks or even a month, to get them out of the schooling mindset.\n\n\nOnce they've gotten into a more relaxed rhythm, talk with them about what they want to learn and how they'd like to learn it. They don't have to have anything concrete at that moment, it will simply introduce the idea again.\n You probably won't see the effects of unschooling immediately. Sometimes children can be recalcitrant and not want to learn anything, especially if they've been in the public school system for awhile. That is okay. It can take time to adjust to a new system and to rediscover their natural curiosity.\n\n\nYou will have to trust your child to take control of their learning. Children are naturally interested in the world and curious about things. Even if it takes time, they will start learning, because they won't be able to help themselves.\nPutting pressure on children to learn can make them anxious and less likely to learn (as often happens in school). Keeping learning stress-free and enjoyable will keep them much more likely to learn for themselves.\n For parents considering unschooling, the problem of reading can seem like a huge one. Reading is so often equated with intelligence. The usual schooling ideas about when children should be reading are, more or less, made up, however. Children learn to read when they want to., Make reading simple, like a serious (not silly) but desirable game and very easy. When children are \"coached\" (not coaxed, not pressured) for playing reading, they tend to have a more consistently positive attitude towards reading. This makes it easier for them to learn to read when they choose to \"play\" reading.\n Find \"push/pull, go/stop, in/out\" on business doors and such, one syllable, and add a few important, two-syllable words like \"EXIT\" and \"ENTER\" which are found. At home, show them each individual letter and mainly teach \"sounds\" of letters, not the names only. A is the name, but \"a, eh, ah\" are some of its sounds, as if it can make cute sounds.\n\n\nStudies have found that unschooling students tend to go from non-reading to fluent in reading very quickly. So whether your child is four or older, each will learn to read when it's best for them.\n The worst thing you can do is pressure your child into hating reading. That \"backfires\" and make them less inclined towards reading. When a child is under stress one is much less likely to accept learning quickly and easily. In fact, some studies have shown that children who have difficulty (or shame) in reading are more likely to act out behavior-wise in school, instead of learning happily.\n\n\nFor example, don't make a young child write out lists of words they need to learn. You'll find that your child will be less likely to want to learn the words, than if they had been left alone to learn on their own. Suggest sounding-out the letters to get new words such as \"c-a-t, cuh eh tuh\", \"ceht\"; \"c-a-t cat\"! Don't force phonics as a study on them as lessons but let the child have their ah-hah moments, to feel the joy of getting a word or an idea. If the child tries to write, be satisfied that it is crooked and spelled oddly: Say, \"Now you're getting it. Keep it up!\"\n\n, By having reading as something that is apart of your daily life, you'll show your child how important it is. You don't have to talk about reading every second of the day, but have books around the house, talk about books that you're reading with your child.\n\n\nAsk your child what books they enjoy most, and make sure to have lots of those types of books around (either from a bookstore, or by going to the library and picking them out with your child).\nDon't do all the reading for them. While it is important to help out your child when they ask for it, by not always doing the reading for them they will realize they importance of learning to read. So, for example, if you're reading a story for them, go at the pace that works for your schedule. If they want to get the story more quickly, they'll need to learn to read it on their own.\n Children tend to learn better when they're exposed to people of all different age groups, with readers and non-readers mixed together. This can be some sort of mixed-age children's group, or reading at home with family.\n\n\nChildren often learn reading through games between readers and non-readers. There are lots of games that require reading comprehension and the readers interpret for the non-readers. The non-readers begin to learn words as they play.\nSome ideas for a family mixed-age interaction might be watching t.v. with the captions on so the non-readers start to identify words and letters, having shared reading time where the whole family gets to read out loud. A nightly reading where parents or older siblings read to the non-reader.\n A lot of times children learn to read, because they learn to write. They often learn to write because they're writing the things that interest them: captions to go along with pictures they draw, stories of their own, notes for their family members.\n\n\nHelp your child spell things when they ask you for help. Otherwise, it's best to let them sort out language on their own. Don't worry, they will learn to spell properly, even if it takes them some time.\n These steps are really only suggestions for things that might help your child learn to read. The person who knows your child's learning style best is your child. Pay attention to how they are learning things and what they want to do. After all, unschooling is about letting you child direct their own learning.\n\n"}

Make sure that you choose a hanger size that will work for your specific plate.\n\n\nThe five sizes are:\n\n1-1/4 inch (3 cm), for plates up to 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter\n2 inches (5 cm), for plates up to 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter\n3 inches (7.5 cm), for plates up to 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter\n4 inches (10 cm), for plates up to 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter\n5-1/2 inches (14 cm), for plates up to 6.5 lbs (3 kg) in weight\n\n\n\n, Dip your fingertip in a little water, then rub your wet finger over the adhesive side of the disc. Wait three to seven minutes, or until the adhesive becomes sticky.\n Look at the front of the plate to determine how you want the dish to hang. Once you determine where the center top will be, press the adhesive side of the disc firmly onto the back of the plate at the center top.\n\n\nPress firmly over the entire adhesive disc to ensure a tight seal.\nYou should let the adhesive dry overnight before you hang the plate.\nTest the bond by gently tugging on the hook. If the disc starts to peel away, the bond is not strong enough. If the disc stays firmly attached to the plate, however, it should be safe to use.\n Figure out where you want the plate to hang and lightly mark that spot with pencil. Hammer a nail into that spot. At least half the nail should be inside the wall, but there should be enough nail hanging outside of the wall for the plate hook to rest on.\n\n\nMake sure that the nail you use has a large head to \"catch\" the hook on so that the plate will not fall off. Alternatively, use a picture hanger instead of a plain nail.\nDetermine where you want the plate by holding it against the wall. Mark the top of the plate on the wall using a light pencil mark.\n\nSet the plate down. Measure the distance between the hanger hook and the top of the plate, then mark out that same distance from the mark on your wall.\nHammer the nail into the second mark you made.\n Gently hang the hook on the nail in the wall. Step back and take a look. If you are satisfied with the results, the process is now complete.\n\n\nIf the plate seems crooked, you will need to remove the hanger start over.\nIf you ever need to remove the hanger, you can do so by soaking the entire contraption--both plate and hanger--in water. After a few minutes, the adhesive should wear away, allowing you to remove it from the back of the plate.\n\n"}

The best notes in the world can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re taking notes on. Remember that the objective is to learn, so don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions.Some professors may ask for you to hold your questions until after the lecture. Make sure to write them down to help you recall what you wanted to ask when the time comes.\nIf you aren\u2019t comfortable speaking in front of the class, try approaching your teacher after class to clarify things you are unsure of.;\n, In order to take effective notes, you will need to learn to pick out the important portions of what your teacher or professor says during their lecture. Disregard conversational material and focus on things your teacher places an emphasis on during class. Make sure to make note of any new topic, questions you have, and anything the teacher places a large emphasis on while covering the course material.If there was assigned reading prior to the class, make note of anything covered in the lecture that differs from how it was presented in the book. Your teacher likely wants you to follow the methodology taught in class.\nThings teachers write out on the board are usually important and should be considered when note taking.\nMake sure to record new topics, formulas needed to solve equations, and anything the teacher suggests is important.\n Taking great notes can help you to retain information in the first place, but studying for an exam or test should always include a thorough review of your notes. You should always go over your notes again after class, then refresh your memory by reviewing them once more before a test. You may also want to compare notes with a classmate to help ensure you both took down all of the important information.Studies have shown that after a week, you can usually only recall 35% of what you learned in class. Retention and recall can drop as low as 21% after two weeks.\nReviewing your notes or going over them with a friend can refresh your memory and help to ensure you retain more of the course material.\n Some people may prefer to use their laptop for note taking rather than writing by hand. If you feel as though you could write faster or take more efficient notes using a laptop computer, you should consider doing so. Some teachers and professors don\u2019t permit open laptops in their class, so make sure laptop use is permitted before you start.Laptops can help you to organize your notes and even type them faster in some cases.\nMake sure you don\u2019t allow yourself to get distracted by using other applications on your laptop during the lecture.\nYou may want to ensure the laptop you use to take notes in math class has a keypad to record numbers faster.\n It can sometimes be hard to keep up when taking notes in class. Using an audio recorder during class can allow you to revisit portions of the lecture that you may have missed, or listen to the entire class again while you\u2019re studying to help clarify topics or refresh them in your mind.If your teacher or professor does not address the use of recording devices ahead of time, you may want to ask them before recording them.\nDigital recorders often allow you to transfer recordings to a computer to better control which portions you want to listen to.\n When taking notes, it\u2019s perfectly normal to skip unnecessary words, use abbreviations or even come up with your own shorthand. However, don\u2019t allow yourself to skip steps when writing out how to complete math problems, or copying them from the board.Although you may know how to complete a problem in class, you might have trouble remembering how to in the future.\nWriting out all of your work will help you to recall each step in the future.\n There are a number of ways you can incorporate different colors into your note taking methods to emphasize the importance of sections or to help you organize your notes. Use different colors to write titles, draw lines between sections, or to help you pick out important elements.Use a highlighter to highlight important things as you take notes or after class when reviewing them.\nTry different colored pens for titles or to add emphasis to sections.\nUse markers or colored pencils to make colorful divisions between topics or sections.\n Sometimes the concepts you need to take notes on in math class involve more than just numbers and equations. When your teacher or professor is going over concepts that require you to take notes that aren\u2019t math problems themselves, use a form of shorthand to limit how much you have to write.Try leaving out unimportant words. An example could be, instead of writing \u201cPythagoras made influential contributions to mathematics,\u201d try simply writing, \u201cPythagoras was influential.\u201d\nUse abbreviations and punctuation to reduce your writing. Your notes only need to make sense to you, so feel free to use + (plus) signs instead of the word \u201cand,\u201d km instead of kilometers, or any other abbreviations you can easily understand.\n\n"}

However, the one major rule is that you should never drill a hole in tempered or safety glass.Tempered glass will shatter upon contact with the drill. To determine whether glass is tempered, look at the four corners of the glass. If the glass is tempered, the manufacturer is supposed to etch the glass at each of the corners.\nAnother caution: When drilling, do not wear loose clothing or long, dangling accessories like necklaces, bracelets, and shirts with long fringes. It\u2019s critical that you not wear anything that can be caught in a power tool. It\u2019s also a good idea to wear protective goggles and gloves when drilling.;\n, If you have a power drill at home already, you can probably use that. Otherwise, you can buy a standard power drill at most home center stores.\n\n\nDrilling a hole in glass does not require a specific drill \u2013 it just requires the right drill bit. It\u2019s important not to use the drill\u2019s full power or top speed when you drill a hole in the glass, though. You could end up cracking the glass. Think about the drilling like you are slowly carving away at glass rather than drilling a hole in it. Locate the speed dial on your drill, and adjust it to a lower level. This will help you slow down the process.\n To drill a hole in glass requires having a drill bit that is specifically equipped to drill through glass. This is very important; you can't just choose any bit you have lying around. Ask at a local hardware store, as they will make sure you purchase the right one. Glass drill bits are pretty common, and you can also buy them online.\n\n\nOne possibility is a carbide bit that is made for drilling glass and tile. Carbide bits have a spade shaped point and are also made to withstand the friction of drilling in glass or tile.You can find carbide bits at many home centers. Just go to the area where they sell drill bits or ask a salesperson. One issue with cheap bits, though, is that they can get dull fast or even break.\n These bits drill glass, sea glass, wine bottles, glass block and other harder materials like marble and stone. Diamonds are a harder substance than glass, so they are perfect for drilling hard substancesDiamond drill bits can be used to drill holes a quarter of an inch or larger. You can choose a rounded end or core bit. Diamond bits will create a smoother end product. Diamond bits are traditional for glass drilling; they will drill many holes with one bit and rarely cause breakage if properly used.\nFor very small holes, you can choose a small diamond drill bit with a solid, flat end, or tip. These are available in very small sizes, as small as 0.75 mm.You could also purchase a diamond grit hole saw. You will need an autostart quick change mandrel tool. These pieces fit on your drill. Use the mandrel on your drill to create the first hole in the glass. Then, put the saw on the drill and place it into the hole you created with the mandrel. Drill the hole through. , You could use an ice cream tub or a plastic photographic tray. You don't want to drill through into a table or something like that.\n\n\nPut a bit of newspaper at the bottom of the container. This will prevent you from drilling a hole through the container itself.\nAnother option is to place the glass on an extremely flat surface where it is completely supported. If you can, put a rubber pad or other firm, cushioning material underneath it, but the glass must be flat and supported. In other words, don't hold the glass up as you drill or something like that.\nAt all times be cautious about safety. Make sure that you aren't drilling in an area where you could damage something, and you want to make sure that power tool cords are not near water.\n This will help prevent the bit from slipping as you start drilling. You could use cereal box cardboard for this purpose.\n\n\nAnother approach is to tape the inside and outside of the glass you will be drilling with packaging tape or painter\u2019s tape This will stop the glass from splintering.\nTear off two pieces of the tape. Place the pieces on the glass in an X pattern over the spot where you want to drill a hole. Never drill within 3/4\" of any edges.\nMake a reference mark on the tape on the spot where you want to drill the hole. This will help guide you as you get ready to drill., You want to drill slower when you are drilling into hard materials; you can find charts online that provide recommended drill speed for different materials, including glass.Chuck a small bit into a variable speed motor drill. Make sure it is secured tightly. It is best to start with a bit maybe about 1/8\" or 3/32\" in size. You only want to create a dimple in the glass at first.\nThen, remove the cardboard or tape and drill faster, at about 400 rpm. If you drill too fast, your drill bit could cause burn marks around the tip. If it seems necessary, swap in a larger bit to enlarge your initial hole. The first hole is a \"pilot\" hole. It will guide the subsequent larger bits as you work your way up to the size of your finished hole, When drilling glass, you should keep the drill at low or medium speeds. When you are close to breaking through, slow it down even more because this is when the glass can be the most fragile.\n\n\nIf you press too hard on the glass with the drill, you could crack it. Hold the drill perpendicular to the glass so that you prevent chipping. You'll want to use lighter pressure if you're new to drilling to make it less likely you make a big mistake. Another approach is to drill half way through, flip the glass over (carefully) and drill through the back side of it until you meet the other hole in the middle., This is very important. Pour a little oil or water on the area that you are drilling. Water is the most common coolant used on drill bits. You will need to use more coolant if you are drilling a harder surface.The coolant will keep the drill bit or saw and glass lubricated and cool. If the glass gets too hot while drilling, it can crack and break.\n\n\nCoolant should be applied both before and during drilling.\nYou could put a bottle with water in it and a small hole in it at the drill hole. It will trickle out and onto the hole as you drill the glass, cooling it.You could also spray a mist of water around the drill bit instead to keep it lubricated. Again, remember to be very careful of electrical cords and water. Try putting the water in a squirt bottle and apply it as you drill. If white powder forms as you drill, you should apply more coolant, and slow the process down.\nYou could also place a wet sponge under the glass as you drill to act as a coolant.Or you could cover the glass with a small amount of water before drilling - basically put it in a shallow water bath in your container.\n\n"}

Tests are administered three times each year, with a testing window of eight days each February, June, and October.Candidates can find a comprehensive listing of test locations online by searching for FSOT test center locations. There is no explicit cut-off score for the examination. Instead, each candidate's overall portfolio is examined in the context of his desired career track.Skills are assessed in each of the following categories:\n\n\nJob knowledge - this category includes multiple choice questions that test the candidate's knowledge of US history and culture, government, world history, finance/economics, and international affairs.English expression - this multiple-choice category tests the candidate's writing and communication skills.Biographic information - this portion of the exam requires the candidate to self-assess his work style, communication skills, and awareness/respect of other cultures.An assigned topic, about which candidates must write an articulate essay in under 30 minutes., Candidates who do well on the FSOT will receive an email from the US Department of State requesting a personal narrative, which will be submitted to the Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP) no later than three weeks from the date the request is sent.The personal narrative allows the candidate to elaborate on his experiences and qualifications. Candidates should focus on providing concrete, positive examples of their abilities, while also addressing how their learning experiences would contribute to a successful career as an FSO.The candidate's PN is evaluated on its ability to address each of the six precepts used by the QEP as predictors of Foreign Service success.\n\n\nLeadership - the QEP assesses the candidate's ability to innovate, make decisions, and work as part of a team.Interpersonal Skills - the candidate's professional standards are evaluated, including his ability to persuade, adapt, and negotiate.Communication Skills - the QEP evaluates the candidate's written and oral communication skills, his ability to actively listen and learn, and his existing foreign language skills, if relevant.Management Skills - the candidate's effectiveness at evaluating, managing, and conducting operations are evaluated by the QEP.Intellectual Skills - the QEP assesses the candidate's critical thinking and active learning abilities, as well as his ability to gather and analyze information.Substantive Knowledge - the QEP examines the candidate's knowledge and understanding of US history, government, and culture, and his potential ability to interact with other cultures., The oral assessment is typically held in Washington, DC, though the Board of Examiners also holds Oral Assessments in San Francisco, CA, if the necessary resources there are available.Candidates have a narrow window for taking the Oral Assessment, and the assessment date is determined by when the candidate took the FSOT.The Oral Assessment is an all-day evaluation which will do each of the following:\n\n\nmeasure the candidate's skills in each of the outlined 13 dimensionsmeasure the candidate's ability to meet the tasks and duties of the Foreign Serviceassess the candidate's skills and personal characteristics, and compare those skills and characteristics with the essential duties within the candidate's preferred career track, Candidates who do well in the Oral Assessment will be given a conditional offer of employment, pending the candidate's ability to obtain medical and security clearance.\n\n\nMedical clearance will be given by either The Office of Medical Services or the Department of State, and is contingent upon the candidate's medical history and his current and projected medical needs. Medical clearance factors in the potentially limited medical resources available at certain Embassy locations around the world.[\nSecurity clearance will be given by the US Department of State, following a thorough background investigation that examines the candidate's employment history, credit history, criminal record, history of substance abuse, and his history of loan and tax payments.Candidates with dual citizenship status, candidates who have extensively stayed abroad for travel, education, or employment purposes, candidates with a foreign-born spouse, and candidates with immediate family members who are not US citizens may experience longer wait periods before clearance is given., Once the background investigation is complete, a Suitability Review Panel will evaluate all of the candidate's materials (with the exception of some medical information) to determine whether the candidate is fit for service as a Foreign Service Officer. The Suitability Review Panel specifically examines:\n\n\nemployment history, including instances of misconduct, poor performance, and inability to collaborate with othersfinancial irresponsibilitycriminal history and personal misconductany instances of deception or fraud during the application processhistory of alcohol use, specifically with regard to the candidate's ability to manage professional expectationsuse or sale/transportation of controlled substancesthe candidate's loyalty to the American governmentany personal or professional instances of poor judgment or lack of discretion, Candidates who successfully pass all examinations and reviews are placed on a hiring register. The register lists candidates by career track and by rankings, which are determined by the candidate's test scores and evaluations. A candidate's position on the register will only last a maximum of 18 months. If the candidate has not received a final job offer after 18 months, his name will be taken off the list, and he will have to complete the application process from the beginning., Candidates who are given an offer of employment will typically be required to move to Washington, DC, often with only a few weeks' notice. Candidates are permitted to decline only one job offer. If the candidate declines a second job offer or cannot meet the training requirements a second time, his name is removed from the hiring register.Certain prior obligations, such as overseas deployment in the military, are permitted as reasonable eligibility for job appointment deferment. However, deferments are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and are rarely granted, even for highly-qualified candidates.For this reason, anyone wishing to work for the Department of State should be prepared to relocate for training and assignment on short notice.\n All new Foreign Service Officers are required to complete the A-100 course, a six-week training and orientation program. During that time FSOs receive enhanced skills training to meet the needs of their Foreign Service appointment., The specialized training a new FSO receives is determined by that officer's work assignment. FSOs who do not speak a foreign language may be required to attend an additional six to nine months of foreign language training, depending on the officer's work assignment. The overall training process for new officers can take up to one year before the officer is assigned to his overseas post."}
{"title": "How to Create a Commercial Real Estate Listing Proposal", "summary": "gather information.\nresearch market data.\nreview and verify all documents.\nwrite a detailed description.\ncompile your information.\nformat the proposal.\npolish the report and add an \"executive summary.\"", "article": " Your first step in putting together a proposal should be to gather as much information as you can. You will need to know about the property itself, but also about your target audience \u2013 the people who will judge the proposal. Try to put yourself in their shoes. What are their needs? What is their situation and knowledge level? The proposal should focus squarely on them and be as customized as possible.Try to get information on the property from the landlord or owner. Get copies of floor plans, site plans, copies of previous leases, rent rolls, tax records, income and expense statements. Check to see if the property has sold recently. If so, note the price trends. This data will be crucial to analyzing the property, valuing it, and then putting together a marketing strategy.If you are responding to a Request for Proposal or RFP, carefully study the request\u2019s requirements. Let them direct your research, so that you can respond to them in your proposal.;\n, One important part of your research will be to look into the local market. Market research will give you indicators of value and rental rates, which can be compared to the proposed listing. This information will not only be key in presenting to the prospect but also in marketing the listing.\n\n\nFor example, find similar sales and lease transactions and take note of the prices. Comparable transactions will help you to value your listing and then, in your proposal, to justify that value.\n Take all of the documents you\u2019ve compiled and review them. Often, you will find inaccuracies. Whether these errors help or hurt the listing\u2019s marketability, it is your job to fix them in order to give the most accurate information to your clients and to potential buyers or tenants.\n Put together a description of the property and its location, highlighting the merits of owning or leasing it. Be careful of how you use language in the description. Favor words that paint a picture and avoid those that may dampen a reader\u2019s interest like \u201cvacant,\u201d \u201cmust sell,\u201d or \u201cvalue.\u201dInclude attractive photos. These are a very important visual aid in pitching the property. In fact, photos are better at conveying a sense of the property than just words.\nHave a list of basic repair and checks that will improve the property\u2019s value \u2013 things like painting or updating the landscaping. These should be simple and give a good return on the investment of time and money., Take all of the data you\u2019ve gathered in your research and begin to put it into logical order for your proposal. There may be a lot to manage. Don\u2019t get overwhelmed. Rather, try to find ways to sort the information. Lay the documents out on the floor or on top of your desk, for example, so that you can easily find them.\n\n\nPotential buyers or leasers will be more interested in some information than in others, like price and valuation. Keep in mind who you are talking to \u2013 your audience. Put yourself in their place. Given their business and aims, what will they most want to know? Prioritize this information.\nAlso sketch out talking points. Use these in your pitch so that you can show that you\u2019ve done a thorough job, that you understand the value of the property, and that you are the best person for the listing.\n Real estate proposals usually have a standard format, following a four-part structure. Generally, you\u2019ll want to have an introduction of yourself and the proposal. A summary of the property and its situation follows and then a description of your ideas and the services that you are offering, including costs and other important details. Only after this should you add information to gain the reader\u2019s trust, like your credentials, experience, education, and awards.The different sections are all important. Start with a client and property brief. This section is short and summarizes the client and what the property offers. It should show that you fully understand what the client needs and how the property can meet their requirements, in addition to provide an accurate description of the property as it currently stands.For the meat of the proposal, you\u2019ll need to bring together all of your data and analysis. You should by now have identified the property\u2019s key assets and features. Explain to your client you valuation and how you envision the target market. Who will you market the property to? What is its size? How will you attract potential buyers? These recommendations should be specific.Finally, talk about yourself, fees, and what you can offer last. At least 75% of the document should be about the property and client, not about you. Make sure that the fees you propose are at least close to parity with what is charged in the local real estate market.\n The last part of the process is the touching up. Visuals will make your report stand out and be easy to understand. Each page should have graphs or charts to break down the data into understandable parts. Photos will also help. Many clients won\u2019t read the entire document anyway, so spare them from wordiness.Last, add a final covering page called an \"executive summary.\u201d This is a short, 1 to 2 page overview that brings together all of the most key items about the property and its marketing. Make it as clear and easy for the client to understand. Consider using bullet points, for example. This section will give the first and most important impression."}

You can often find good deals on tableware and settings at discount stores, department stores, and dollar stores. If you do not have money to spend on tableware or settings, you could also ask to borrow a few things from a friend or family member.Try using disposable plates. You can save money and avoid the dishes.\n Place a large bowl in the middle of your table. Before the meal or during appetizers, distribute small pieces of paper and some pens to guests. Ask guests to write a note about something they are thankful for in their life. Ask them if they are comfortable sharing their notes and, if so, to fold them and put them in the wishing well. During dessert, you can ask a volunteer to read a few of the notes aloud., The dollar store is one of the cheapest places to find holiday decorations. You can even purchase conventional products like glasses, candles, and buckets and then use them to make your own decorations. If you are really ahead of the game, you could buy your decorations the day after the holiday, when they are really cheap, and then use them the following year., Instead of going to the movies or to the shopping mall, you could go for a hike. Hiking is a free activity that has the additional benefit of ensuring everyone in the family gets some exercise on this busy and often stressful holiday. Look for hikes that are close to your family holiday location and include the family hike in your itinerary. The advantage of hiking over other physical activities is that it does not necessarily require specialized equipment, special skills or fitness levels. In other words, as long as one is able bodied, one can probably enjoy a short walk or hike in the woods.\n\n\nIf there are differently abled people in your group, you should look for a path that meets their mobility needs.\nSpecialized hiking equipment is available such as walking poles and hiking shoes, but this equipment is not necessary for a short, easy Thanksgiving day hike.\n\n"}

Possums damage the plants when they eat the new growth, so this needs to be prevented.Possums may remove all of the buds, thereby weakening the plant, creating bare patches, and making it easier for plant diseases to take hold.Keep this in mind when planting new plants in your yard or when planting a garden. If you plant things a possum doesn't like, such as prickly and smelly plants like a tea tree or geraniums for example, they are less likely to be destroyed.;\n, For example, there are cloth bags that are made to cover individual fruits in a tree. Each one can be covered separately.This will stop the possums from getting to the fruit and does not interfere with the growth of the fruit.You can also use old plastic plant pots with a slit down the side to protect individual fruits or vegetables. Place the fruit inside the pot, so that it is mostly covered but can still grow.\n Instead of keeping possums out of your yard, you can just try to keep them out of specific garden beds. The best way to do this is to create a full enclosure out of chicken wire.\n\n\nThis may make tending your garden a little more difficult but it will assure that your plants survive.\n Possums may make their way into your eaves or other access points on your house or shed. Possums trying to get into your garden shed or house eaves can be deterred by covering openings with permanent covers, such as pieces of wood, or by using anti-bird netting over any holes or entrance points. Just make sure that the possums are not inside the shed or eaves when you cover them, as you could trap them inside.\nIf you're not sure how the possums are getting in, patrol the area at dusk and watch for possums leaving their den.\n\n"}

These typically will swivel or rotate slightly in order to be make better contact with the surface the ladder is on.\nThe fly section is the portion of the extension ladder that will be extended upward. This is the portion that you will climb as you get closer to the top. Additionally, it should be noted that some extension ladders have a two-part fly (and three primary ladder components in total).\nThe base section is the portion of the extension ladder that will remain in place. When you begin to climb the ladder, you will start out on the rungs of this section.\nThe rung lock is attached to the fly and is used to keep the fly in place by fitting over the top of a rung of the base or fly section underneath. It will essentially act as a bracket, and the fly will not be able to slide down after weight if put on it.\nThe rope and pulley are used to extend the largest of extension ladders. Smaller ladders do not have this component, but larger ones are essentially unusable if this is broken.;\n, Serious injuries resulting from the use (or misuse) of extension ladders are so common that they have developed a bit of a reputation. Knowing how they earned that reputation--and how those accidents could have been prevented-- can help you stay safe.\n\n\nExtension ladders typically only have two points of contact with the ground. Some varieties of smaller ladders fold out to create four separate points of contact with the ground. Extension ladders typically have nothing other than the \"feet\" or \"shoes\" on the two side rails. Consequently, they can be a bit unstable.\nExtension ladders are among the tallest available in retail sales outlets. It is not merely that their height makes for longer falls (though that is true as well). Instead, the height only accentuates the preexisting instability issues. Think of the ladder as a lever. When you climb the ladder, the weight is actually moved closer to the end of the lever.\nPeople commonly misuse extension ladders. Because of their instability issues, there are certain precautions that must be taken. First, two people must be involved in the use of the ladder. When one person climbs, another must be available to \"foot\" the ladder (hold it in place). Secondly, the ladder cannot be used a vertical or near-vertical angles. Instead, they must bed tilted or leaned on to another object for support as a person climbs to the top (more on this in a moment). This will minimize the \"leverage\" issue previously noted.\n Each ladder is capable of bearing a different quantity of weight, and you must know how much yours can handle before you you use it. There are a number of ladder classification systems in use--several of which use very similar terminology to mean rather different things--and so it is not practical to list them here. Regardless of type, your ladder should state directly on it (at least when it is new) how much weight it can bear. Do not ever exceed that limit.\n Damage to the rungs, the rung lock, or pulley could make it dangerous or impractical to use an extension ladder. Look the ladder over carefully before you begin use.\n It should be locked in place using the rung lock or other safety feature. If the fly slides as you are moving the ladder, fingers and hands could be pinched or broken as they get caught between the fly and the base or between the rungs of the two sections.\n Move the ladder into place (without yet extending it) and set it down on the shoe or foot that is attached to the base. For most extension ladders the fly should be on top of the base--that is, not only should it extend higher, but should on the outer/climbable side.Understand that in order to obtain the proper climbing angle, the base of the ladder should be 1/4 of the height of the extended ladder away from the building. For example, if the working height of the extended ladder is 12 feet (3.66 m), the base of the ladder should be 3 feet (.914 m) away from structure., If your ladder uses a pulley, simply pull on the rope to extend the ladder. If not, push the fly up manually.\n\n\nMake sure that the base of the ladder is continuously footed (with at least one person holding both rails of the base continuously) during the raising process.\nObserve extreme caution if extending the ladder in windy conditions.\nIf working on or examining a roof, extend the ladder to about 3 feet (.914 m) above the working height., This will ensure that the fly will not slide closed while climbing the ladder.\n making sure that you continue to foot the ladder so that the base of the ladder does not kick out. Make sure that both sides of the ladder have good contact with the structure. If one edge of the ladder is not touching the structure, it is not safe and no one should climb the ladder.\n Climb the ladder one rung at a time. Maintain a hold with both hands as you move your feet up each rung. Do not carry other items in your hands at this time. If you need small tools with you, place them in a tool belt that you can carry around your waist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are fully extending the ladder, you should use a tie down or bungee cord to secure the ladder in place. Wrap it around the top part of the ladder, and secure it to the building.\n\n"}

This step has three most important goals to achieve; color, smell and taste. The idea is to completely destroy the activity of enzymes in the fresh leaves in order to put an end to the enzymatic oxidation of polyphenols. This \u00a0technique also achieves the characteristic glassy flavor for green tea in order to release its aroma and evaporate the water \u00a0content present in the fresh tea leaves. The procedure enhances the toughness of the leaves to prepare it for the next step rolling.;\n, From the withering racks, the leaves are now twisted and rolled so that the leaf cells could be broken up. The purpose of rolling is to make the shape of the tea leaves tighter so that it is easier for them to follow the next step easily. The tea leaves are twisted in this stage in order to make their quality better for an easy brew to the tea liquor. Oils released during the process gives the distinct aroma to the tea leaves. In the case of green tea, the process of rolling is carried out with hands.\n The drying of the produced tea is responsible for many of its characteristic compounds. This is also the technique which improves its appearance. Firing the tea stops the process of oxidation. After the all the above mentioned steps are taken care of, and you get the final processed green tea which is ready to be brewed into a fragrant and sweet light tasting beverage.\n\n"}

Through thick and thin. They give you advice, along with a shoulder to rest on. Go out with your friends, be happy with them. Don't just sit locked up in your room, isolated from the people who want to be around you.\n This is not meant in the harsh physical way. It means you should do everything to show them you don't care anymore. Sometimes, this can simply be achieved by being your normal self. Stop trying to impress them if you did so in the past. Instead, start doing the things you want to do, such as wearing clothes you actually like, doing sports you love, listening to music you like, etc.\n It doesn't need to be far if that's not practical.

As long as you're interested in going there, traveling can be a great way to stop obsessing over someone.\nTalk with locals, engage in the community, and have fun. When you travel, focus on the new you. The new you is excited about learning, will put him/herself out there, and wants to have new experiences. What's the use of traveling if you don't put yourself out there?\n\n, Don't forget: forgetting takes time. It can take as long as years to get over someone. But it does get easier. Life is never easy, but the more you understand, and the better you understand about yourself, the easier it will get.

The narrator knows everything about each character and the world. The narrator can reveal or withhold any thoughts, feelings, or actions.For instance, a story may include four major characters: William, Bob, Erika, and Samantha. At various points throughout the story, the thoughts and actions of each character should be portrayed. These thoughts can occur within the same chapter or block of narration.\nExample: \u201cWilliam thought that Erika was lying, but he still wanted to believe that she had a good reason for doing so. On the other hand, Samantha believed that Erika was lying and felt jealous about the fact that Tony wanted to think well of the other girl at all.\u201d\nWriters of omniscient narratives should be conscious of \u201chead-hopping\u201d \u2014 that is, shifting character perspectives within a scene. While this does not technically break the rules of Third Person Omniscience, it is widely considered a hallmark of narrative laziness.\n With third person omniscient view, the narration is not limited the inner thoughts and feelings of any character. Along with inner thoughts and feelings, third person omniscient point of view also permits the writer to reveal parts of the future or past within the story. The narrator can also hold an opinion, give a moral perspective, or discuss animals or nature scenes where the characters are not present.In a sense, the writer of a third person omniscient story is somewhat like the \u201cgod\u201d of that story. The writer can observe the external actions of any character at any time, but unlike a limited human observer, the writer can also peek into the inner workings of that character at will, as well.\nKnow when to hold back. Even though a writer can reveal any information he or she chooses to reveal, it may be more beneficial to reveal some things gradually. For instance, if one character is supposed to have a mysterious aura, it would be wise to limit access to that character's inner feelings for a while before revealing his or her true motives.\n Active dialog should be the only time that first person pronouns like \u201cI\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d should appear.

Your obstetrician or midwife may not approve of prenatal yoga if you are at risk of preterm labor or have medical conditions like heart disease or back problems.Though your doctor may advise against yoga postures, you may still be able to do deep breathing exercises and gentle sitting poses. Have a discussion with your doctor about the limits of your prenatal yoga practice and which postures may be most beneficial for your body.\nMost doctors recommend that pregnant women only do gentle yoga during their first trimester, and wait until their second or third trimester to do any advanced yoga postures. If you are a first time practitioner or new to yoga and pregnant, you should only do gentle, prenatal yoga to prevent any harm or risk to your pregnancy.\nPregnant women release a hormone called relaxin, which helps to soften your connective tissue and makes your pelvic joints more flexible so there is space for your baby. However, this hormone can also lead to instability in your sacroiliac joints and lead to back pain. You should be careful not to overstretch your body when doing yoga, as your body is more susceptible to injury.;\n, You will need to prepare for prenatal yoga by buying a yoga mat, and yoga props like a yoga block. You can use these props to help you ease into postures and avoid injuring your body, especially if you are carrying more weight due to your pregnancy.\n\n\nA yoga bolster, which is a long pillow made for yoga, can also be useful for restorative yoga or gentle yoga classes. Restorative yoga is a type of yoga that does not use any muscle engagement and focuses on restoring and relaxing your body with the help of yoga props like bolsters, blankets, and blocks. It is also a good option for pregnant women, especially if you are looking to reduce your stress level and ease any aches or pains in your body.\n It is important that you drink plenty of water before and after you do yoga to make sure you are not dehydrated.\n\n\nYou should also make sure you eat a light snack one to two hours before you do yoga, such as nuts and yogurt, fruit, or a smoothie. Avoid big, heavy meals before your yoga practice, as this can lead to indigestion. Eating a small snack one to two hours before class will keep your blood sugar up and help to prevent fainting or dizziness.\n One of the most important parts of doing prenatal yoga safely is knowing which postures you should avoid and how you should move your body in yoga postures. When you do yoga poses, bend from your hips, rather than your back, to ensure you are maintaining a normal spine curvature. Never lie flat on your belly or your back, and only bend forward or backward in poses to your waist. Do not do deep bends forward or backward, as this can put unsafe pressure on your stomach.As well, you should adjust your body in twisting postures so you only move your upper back, your shoulders, and your rib cage, and avoid putting pressure on your abdominal area. Unless you are an experienced yoga practitioner, you should avoid inverted postures, such as shoulder stand or headstand, which require you to extend your legs above your head or your heart.\nAvoid bikram yoga or hot yoga, as the room temperature will likely be too humid for you to be comfortable when pregnant. Bikram yoga can also raise your body temperature, leading to hypothermia. Listen to your body and do not push or stress out your body during your practice. A good gauge is if you cannot speak while you are doing prenatal yoga, you are likely pushing your body too hard and need to ease off of a posture or pose.\n To help guide you through yoga postures, you may want to consider subscribing to an online prenatal yoga series. There are many free prenatal yoga videos online from certified yoga instructors that can help to guide you through your practice. Subscribing to these video channels are usually free and many videos are short, so you can try a few postures at a time.\n\n\nAlways check that the yoga instructor is certified and specializes in prenatal yoga. This will ensure she has the necessary experience to teach prenatal yoga safely.\nOften, online yoga videos will use a pregnant women to demonstrate the postures to show you the safe way to do them. If you feel at all uncomfortable with doing any of the postures, slowly ease out of them and take a deep breath. Never do any postures if you feel any sharp pains or overwhelming discomfort in them.\n Joining a prenatal yoga class can be a good way to get hands on instruction and to connect to other expecting mothers in a fun, relaxing environment. Look for an instructor who is certified and has experience teaching prenatal yoga. You may want to ask other women you know who have taken prenatal yoga before to recommend a certain instructor or yoga studio.A typical prenatal class may include deep breathing exercises, gentle stretching, yoga postures using props like blocks, and a period of relaxation.\n Begin by sitting crossed legged or with your legs apart on the floor against a wall. Keep your whole back against the wall, with your spine straight and your shoulders and tailbone against the wall. You can also sit on a cushion or a blanket to get more comfortable and settled. Doing supported sitting pose can help to strengthen your back and help your spine feel more aligned.You can also try firm sitting pose, which is a variation on supported sitting pose. To do firm sitting pose, kneel on a yoga mat and place a cushion or a folded blanket between your legs. Lean forward slightly and make sure your feet are flat against the floor, with the cushion firmly between your legs.\nUsing your hands to support yourself, slowly lower your butt between your heels so it sits on the cushion. If you feel any discomfort in your knees or back, shift your feet or add another cushion to give your body more height. Rest your hands on your thighs or behind you for support. Lift your chest to the ceiling and take five to ten deep breaths.\n Bound angle pose or Baddha Konasana can help to increase blood circulation to your pelvic floor and get your pelvis used to the feeling of opening, similar to the opening you will likely experience during labor.To do bound angle pose, sit on a mat with your back straight and your feet bent at the knee. Slowly open your legs to either side so you form a triangle, with the soles of your feet touching each other. You can shift your legs so they are closer or further away from you, depending on your level of comfort.\nPlace your hands on your thighs or wrap them around your feet. Lift your chest up so it faces in front of you, and take five to ten deep breaths in this posture.\n Squat pose can be very beneficial for your circulation and help to strengthen your pelvic floor. It can also help to stretch your back and hips.Start with your legs a little wider than shoulder distance apart. Breathe in as you place your hands together in prayer in the center of your chest.\nBreathe out as you slowly bend your knees and lower your butt towards the ground. You should be moving your hips and back downward. Only go as far as is comfortable for you. Your weight should be on your heels, not the balls of your feet. Squeeze your pelvic floor muscles up and in.\nHold the squat for one breath and then inhale as you put weight into your heels and slowly straighten back up to the starting position.\nRepeat this posture five to ten times, breathing in and out as you raise and lower your body.\n Stretch your spine and lower back by doing cat and cow posture. Start in the \u201ctable position\u201d with your knees under your hips and your arms aligned under your shoulders. Make sure your back is straight and your gaze falls down on the ground in front of you.Inhale as you raise your head and your tailbone, allowing your belly to drop down toward the ground. Your back should be curved but not overarching\u00a0. Move your gaze upward.\nExhale as you lower your head and hollow out your back, dropping your tailbone down to the ground. Tighten your buttock and abdominal muscles.\nAlternate between cat and cow pose, breathing in and out with each movement, for five to ten breaths.\n Warrior poses can build strength and stretch out your hips and back. You may also feel very powerful when you are in warrior pose, especially as an expectant mother.Begin by placing your feet about four feet apart on your mat. Turn your front foot forward so it is parallel to your mat. Breathe in and slowly bend into your front knee so it is bent and your back leg is straight. Press your feet firmly into the mat.\nRaise your arms so they are over your head, on either side of your ears, and then bring them together into prayer if this is comfortable. Your hips should be square and facing the front of the room. Breathe in and out in this posture four to five times.\nYou can then transition into warrior II pose by separating your arms and spreading them so they are parallel to the mat. As you do this, turn your body so your torso is facing the side of the room. Your legs should remain the same, front leg bent and back leg straight.\nPress into your feet as you tuck your tailbone in and gaze at the tips of your front hand. Breathe in and out in this pose four to five times.\n Deep breathing can help you sleep better, decrease any stress or anxiety and better prepare you for labor breathing. Do Ujjayi breathing, which is long, deep breathing where you make a whooshing noise as you breathe in and out. It is good for building heat in your body and for maintaining a calm mind.\n\n\nYou should avoid any breathing exercises that could limit your baby\u2019s oxygen supply, as this could put your baby at risk. Talk to your yoga instructor or your doctor before you try deep breathing to ensure you are doing it properly.\n Doing balancing postures when pregnant can be difficult, as you will be carrying extra weight and a protruding belly. However, doing balancing postures like Half Moon against a wall will allow you to experience the pose without the risk of falling over.To do Half Moon against a wall, stand with your legs hip width apart, with your right foot next to a wall. Turn your toes so they both face the front of the room. Place a yoga block a few inches in front of your right foot and and place your right hand on the block.\nUsing the wall as a support, press your hand into the yoga block and lift your left leg off the ground. Open your left hip as your raise your leg. Put weight into your right leg and slowly lift your left arm to the ceiling.\nRepeat this on your left side, with your left foot against the wall.\n Pregnant women should avoid lying flat on their back as this can compress the vena cava and lead to possible heart issues for the mother or the child. For postures where you should be lying on your back, you can modify them using bolsters or blankets. Place the bolsters or blankets under your head and heart so that they are both raised. This will allow you to still get the benefits of the pose without putting your health at risk.You can do this in legs-up-against-the-wall pose, with your legs up against a wall and your heart and head raised. Your body should form a \u201cV\u201d shape to ensure you are well supported and not at any risk of issues or problems.\n Corpse pose or Savasana is one of the most relaxing postures in yoga, and is often used to end a yoga class or a yoga session. This pose is usually done by lying flat on your back with your legs wide and your arms as your sides. Pregnant women can modify this relaxing closing pose by using pillows or a bolster.To do a modified corpse pose, lie on your left side with your legs bent and hug a bolster or a pillow to your chest. This will allow you to enjoy a relaxing pose without putting your body at risk.\n\n"}

When it comes to colors, you are limited to choosing between blue, red and green for boys; pink, yellow and white for girls.\nTherefore, if you want to give your toddler's bed a more unique, sophisticated and designer feel, it's a much better idea to design and create the bed yourself. You don't even have to buy a new bed, you can just re-design an old one.;\n, Most parents prefer wooden toddler beds, although there are other types such as plastic toddler bed, canopy bed, portable bed or cot.\n\n\nWhatever the type you have, all of these beds have very basic features; all of them are low to the ground, have side rails to protect your little one from falling when sleeping, and a foot and head board.\nIf you are especially creative and if you have the talent, you can stencil your toddler\u2019s bed frame with designs that you can download online or have made yourself.\n You can definitely paint over the original design of your toddler\u2019s bed if it is made of wood, even more so if the toddler bed is painted white. White furniture is like a blank canvass waiting for the artist\u2019s hand in creating unique patterns and designs.\n\n\nYou will want to choose a paint that\u2019s water based (acrylic; latex) because this gives a better gloss and color retention. It\u2019s also quick to dry so this fits your weekend project better. It has less odor and low on VOC\u2019s (volatile organic chemicals) that are flammable.\nThese features are best suited to your toddler\u2019s bed rather than oil based paints that are flammable and gives out a strong odor.\n You can choose from a variety of paint colors available at your local hardware or home shopping store. If your toddler hasn\u2019t chosen his or her favorite color yet, go with gender-neutral colors like grey, plum, wine, aqua, ivory and tan.\n\n\nThese colors provide an additional canvas for your toddler\u2019s bedroom color scheme. However, you can also work with whatever color palette comes to your imagination.\nAsk your local hardware store if they can give you free paint swatches so you can decide which hues and colors you want.\n Choose basic, solid color fabrics that you can use as a canvas for your creativity. A simple white duvet can be embellished with trims, fabric flowers, or if you have the talent, you can embroider on the white duvet or bed cover.\n\n\nIf you want, skip using a duvet and create a quilt instead. It\u2019s traditionally used as a bed cover but since this is a project you are doing on your own, you are only limited to your own creativity.\n Another vehicle to add a splash of color to your toddler\u2019s bed are his or her pillows. Go with colors that compliment whatever color you've chosen for the bed cover or the duvet.\n\n\nYou can also go for pillows with white pillow covers and just add trimming and embellishments of your choice to the pillow covers to up the design factor.\n You can go with minimalist and contemporary designs, rustic and country styles or colorful and eclectic options. You can base the design on your toddler\u2019s temperament and character.\n\n\nFor example, if she is bubbly and perky, then go with colorful and eclectic designs with splashes of color everywhere. If your toddler is contemplative, mild mannered and shy, you can go with a modern and contemporary or minimalist design where he or she can be most comfortable in.\nSome decorations include a bookcase, a study table, a lamp, some decorative hangings such as buntings and even pictures of your toddler or the whole family in frames.\n Once you have chosen the palette of your choice and the paint for the bed frame, start by applying the paint to the bed frame.\n\n\nYou can use a HVLP (high volume low pressure) spray painter, as this is easier and less time consuming.\nYou can check your local hardware store to see if they can rent a HVLP spray painter; most stores allow rental for around a hundred dollars.\n You can place the bed frame in a well-ventilated area either inside or outside the house (the garage). Make sure to cover the floors and the nearby area with old newspapers and wear something that you won\u2019t mind getting dirty.\n\n\nIf you have purchased a toddler bed that has a frame that has already been treated with lacquer or urethane, you will need to strip this down using a TSP or Tri Sodium Phosphate.\nTSP basically is just a chemical that \u201crinses off\u201d whatever chemical was applied initially to furniture. Just read the instructions on the TSP on when to apply the TSP and how to remove it afterwards.\n Next, you are ready to sand down the bed frame. You can definitely do this by hand or if you do not have the time, you can get a random orbital sander.\n\n\nAgain, check with your local hardware if and how much they rent this out. Just make sure to ask help from a professional if you are hesitant about using the orbital sander.\nHowever, you can definitely sand down the bed frame by hand; it isn\u2019t as hard to do.\n Next, clean the surfaces of the toddler bed and remove all dust either by using a vacuum cleaner or a tack cloth; even a cotton rug with rubbing alcohol will do. The idea is to not redistribute the fine dust all over the bed surface and all over the place.\n\n\nThe next step is to apply your primer. This is an important part of your project because it gives the bed frame a nice even and professional looking finish. You can apply the primer as you would the paint. You can use roller, brush or the HVLP sprayer.\nSome of the best brands of primer in the market are Kilz and Zinsser. Both primers have a selection of low-odor types so you definitely want to use those.\n Professionals do one other step that distinguishes their work from the amateurs and that\u2019s sanding the wood again after applying the primer.\n\n\nNo hard work necessary because you just need to re-sand lightly and smoothly. The goal is to make the surface as smooth to the touch as possible.\nOnce more, after sanding, clean the surface using a vacuum or cloth with rubbing alcohol.\n Now, you are ready to apply two coats of either glossy or matte wood paint using the HVLP or a brush or a roller; depending on how fast you want the job done and how comfortable you are using each of these tools.\n\n\nWhen using a paintbrush, use a 2\u201d paint brush for wide surfaces and a 1\u201d paint brush for narrow surfaces. Make sure that your strokes are even and paint along the direction of the grain.\nThe same technique applies when using a roller. The trick to painting is sure, even and quick strokes. Avoid re-working over what you have already painted on especially if it has begun to dry.\n Afterwards, check your work to make sure that the overall finish is even and no signs of overspray are evident. Once you are satisfied with the paint job, let it stand for a couple of hours or a day or two, depending on the instructions at the paint can.\n You can use a variety of fabric decors and trims available to decorate your toddler\u2019s basic white duvet. If you want to go with graphic designs, do not overload the duvet with a lot of it because then, it would look disorganized and loud.\n\n\nSimple, one-theme graphic designs are best. If applying trims to the duvet, make sure that all trims are straight and aligned along the sides of the mattress (not the duvet itself) as you will want to create depth when applying these trims to the duvet.\nYou can also use piping, lace, jewelry, cord, tassel trims or the more playful venice trims. Most of these trims need to be machine sewn or if you have the time, hand stitched to the fabric rather than applying them using fabric glue. Stitching the trims makes it more durable, as machine washing the fabrics will remove the fabric glue.\nCheck the alignment of your trims \u2013 make the bed and cover it with the duvet you have embellished with the trims. Make sure that the outside edges of the trim details are straight and aligned with the edge of the mattress and the toddler bed.\n You can choose pillow covers that will compliment the style of the duvet you made or choose pillow covers in basic solid colors.\n\n\nFor example, if you have chosen aqua for the bed frame, then you can use light yellow pillow covers or white pillow covers with yellow trims or decors.\nIf you\u2019ve chosen plum for the bed frame, you can partner it with ivory or white and brown duvet or bed covers and pillows with brown or ivory details.\n A bedside table that has the same or complimentary color to the bed frame, a stylish lamp, a wall clock and a bookcase are the basic things you need to complete the look.\n\n\nIf your toddler bed has a head board, this is another canvas that you can use for your creative mind.\nYou can either leave it wearing the solid color you gave the bed frame or you can also add details like stencils or pictures of your toddler or pictures of his favorite things.\n If your toddler's bed doesn\u2019t have a head board already, you can use a bookcase that fits the width of the bed; this pulls double duty in being a head board and a place to stow away toys or books or stuffed animals, which your toddler has easy access to.\n If you have the budget and the time, you can always hire professionals to create a bespoke design for your toddler's bed.\n\n\nThis is a pricey project, but it is guaranteed to give you a unique bed for your little one. From castle designs, to princess carriages, jungle themes to race car designs, you are only limited to your creative imagination.\nSo as long as the professional or professionals you are going to hire can guarantee that they can deliver the look you want, then by all means, go to the drawing board and start designing.\n Some parents buy the Kura bed for their children, but these are mostly bought for slightly older children since the Kura bed is a loft bed. Loft beds are high off the ground so it may not be the most suitable bed for your toddler because there is the danger of falling off.\n\n\nHowever, loft beds are the perfect canvas for creating a stylish and bespoke bed that can be transformed into a castle just by adding some wooden boards to emulate castle walls.\nYou can use the bottom space of the loft bed to store your children\u2019s toys, books, bean bags, or; you can place a study table with lamp to transform the space into a study area or reading nook for your children.\nIf you decide to go for a loft bed, you could consider creating a sleeping space for your toddler underneath, and allow an older child to sleep on top.\n If you have a trundle toddler bed, you can apply the same techniques for decorating a bed as described in the section above. You can purchase a basic white trundle bed frame and just apply the paint of your choice.\n\n\nVamp up the mattress by creating or designing your own duvet or bed covers and pillows.\nFor plastic trundle beds, you can choose spray paint made especially for application on plastic surfaces then follow the basic guidelines listed above.\n Generally, if a project will cost you more than two days hard labor and will take too much effort on your part (think in terms of manual labor such as lifting heavy loads to and from your house), the project might best be done hiring a pro.\n\n\nIf a basic redo such as re-painting, sewing, embellishing and decorating with store-bought items, and if the project can be done within a day or two, a D.I.Y can be accomplished.\nIt is a good thing that revamping your toddler\u2019s bed can mostly be done over the weekend, on your own or with a little help from a partner. Or if finishing the project over the weekend becomes overwhelming, you can opt to spread out the time when you will work on it.\n You should also consider the cost of your materials and the manual tools that you will be using for the D.I.Y project.\n\n\nMost professional workers are able to score a discounted rate for some building and paint materials. However, with a little bit of effort you can find these same kind of materials in architectural salvage stores or reuse centers or even from your neighbor\u2019s garage sale.\nDecorating your toddler\u2019s bed won\u2019t be that pricey since it would mostly involve just re-painting the bed frame with whatever color your toddler wants and there\u2019s a range of paint colors available in the market to choose from. You can hand paint or use HVLP (high volume; low pressure) sprayer.\nTons of duvets, bed and pillow covers are also available on the market. There\u2019s an array of fabrics printed with well loved cartoon characters and fabrics in basic colors that you can mix and match with other decors in your toddler\u2019s bedroom; and these come in affordable prices that can fit your budget.\n Generally, anything involving plumbing, lifting heavy loads, electrical and wiring should be done by a professional.\n\n\nIt simply isn\u2019t worth your time, effort and money to try doing these things on your own, especially if you have zero knowledge on these skills.\nPainting a toddler\u2019s bed or any other furniture in your home can mostly be done outside in a well ventilated area or even inside, as long as you do it without the kids around and make the area is well ventilated as possible.\n Paint, a simple paintbrush and a roller tray are basically all you need in vamping up your toddler\u2019s bed.\n\n\nIf you want to use a HVLP sprayer, ask your local hardware store if they can rent out this equipment to you for a day or two.\nSewing your toddler\u2019s duvet or bed cover is something that you can do, or you can choose to buy basic bed covers at the local home shopping store and decide later on if you want to embellish or decorate the covers more.\n The last thing you should consider is you.\n\n\nDo you have the time and patience see the job through? Can you make the necessary adjustments in your schedule to finish the job? What if it doesn\u2019t turn out the way you want it to? Do you have a back up plan? Can you follow directions and are you resourceful?\nThese questions are here to help you evaluate your capacity to see a D.I.Y project through. If you answered positively to these questions then, by all means, decorate your toddler\u2019s bed on your own. It might be a bit daunting at first, but you might be surprised to find out that you may have the aptitude for D.I.Y.\n\n"}

Check your thermometer\u2019s directions to figure out how to change the type of reading.\nMercury thermometers should be shaken down to the end closest to the mercury tip before inserting to ensure the most accurate reading. The mercury thermometer may have both Fahrenheit and Celsius, you will have to check your particular instrument.;\n, Have the other person give the dog a \u201chug\u201d by placing his or her left arm under the neck of the dog and using his or her left hand to hold the side of the dog's face against the shoulder.

If your dog is comfortable lying down and stays there for the temperature taking, then you can leave them lying down.\nSitting is not the preferred position because the rectum will not be easily accessible., If you have any indication that the dog may bite or you may injure the dog while trying to restrain your pet, stop! It is better to wait and take your dog to its veterinarian to get its temperature taken than to risk injury to the dog or yourself.\n Lift from the base of the tail, rather than the tip. This will give you more control over the animals movement and prevent the dog's tail from wagging.\n\n\nIt may be helpful to have your helper hold the dog's tail up for you.\n Be careful not to insert the thermometer too deep, or too shallow, as this will affect the readings.Try to gently insert along the side of the rectum, particularly if there is feces present.\n\n\nThe anus is the opening into the rectum, which is a long tube that collects feces. The anus is a muscular sphincter that relaxes and opens to allow feces to leave the rectum. The sphincter can shut very tightly if the dog is painful or afraid.

Some types of blindness are reversible if they are treated right away. For example, if your cat is suffering from blindness caused by hypertension, a daily medication may restore her sight and prevent further health problems as well.Make sure that your cat gets regular check-ups with a veterinarian even if she seems healthy. Early diagnosis and treatment of a problem can prevent your cat from going blind.;\n, Sometimes a cat will go blind over a period of days, weeks, or months. After the cat has become mostly or totally blind, you may begin to notice some strange behavior. Observe your cat to determine if she might be blind. Some of the behaviors that blind cats display include:Seeming confused about her surroundings\nBumping into furniture and other objects\nMissing jumps or landings that she used to manage with ease\nSeeming reluctant to move around or venture outdoors\nRubbing or squinting her eyes\n\n, If your cat\u2019s behavior has you suspicious that she might have gone blind, inspect her eyes to see if they look different than usual. Even if your cat is not showing signs of blindness, you should inspect your cat\u2019s eyes regularly to check for early symptoms of blindness. Some common symptoms of blindness in cats include:Eyes don\u2019t respond to light, pupils are dilated\nEyes look cloudy, inflamed, or discolored\n\n, Since your cat may have a hard time navigating the house at first, you should do your best to provide a home that is as free from obstacles as possible. Keeping the floor clear will help your cat to navigate the house without bumping into things.Some suggestions for how to minimize obstacles in your home include:\n\n\nLeaving your furniture where it is\nKeeping your home clean and clutter-free\nTeaching children to pick up their toys after they are finished playing with them\n\n, Since your cat no longer has her sense of sight to determine whether or not something or someone is a threat, she may be more frightened by loud noises than she was before losing her sight. Help your cat to feel calm and safe by avoiding making loud noises and asking others to do the same.If you accidentally make a loud noise, make sure to comfort your cat by petting her and speaking softly to her. Some other suggestions for maintaining a calm environment include:\n\n\nGetting up slowly from a chair instead of jumping up suddenly\nWalking upstairs to speak to someone instead of yelling up to them\nAvoiding slamming cupboards and doors\n\n, Since your cat can no longer see you when she enters a room, you might want to develop a habit of humming or chatting to yourself to let her know where you are. Your cat may also feel safer and more relaxed if you hum and chat when you are around her. This will also help prevent startling your cat when you want to pet her. By announcing your presence, she will be less likely to be surprised by the feeling of your hand on her back., If your cat used to go outside before she went blind, stay with your cat as much as you can when she ventures outside. By being present as your cat rediscovers the outdoors, you can rescue her from any mishaps while still allowing her to enjoy being outside.\n\n\nTry keeping your cat in an enclosed garden when she wants to go outside. This will help minimize the chances that she will get injured or lost.Consider getting a cat harness and leash to prevent your cat from wandering off into danger.\nIf you are unable to monitor your cat while she is outside, do not let her go out.\n If your cat has been diagnosed with a medical condition that requires special treatment, medication, or other interventions, make sure that you follow the veterinarian\u2019s instructions. If your cat\u2019s blindness is related to a medical condition, it will not improve until she is cured. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve despite treatment.\n\n\nBe aware that some forms of blindness are not reversible even with medical interventions. Your cat may remain blind for the rest of her life, but she can still have a happy life., Your cat is still normal. Even though she has gone blind, she will still want to do everything that a cat likes to do, like playing. While buying toys, look for cat toys that are made specifically for blind cats. Also, shift from sight-based games to sound-based ones, such as \"follow-the-noise.\" Anything that crinkles, crackles, resounds or can be tapped can serve as a new source of entertainment.\n\n\nTry buying toys that squeak like a mouse or chirp like a bird. Your cat might like to play follow the noise with those types of toys.\n Groom your cat regularly, feed your cat nutritious food, provide occasional treats, and take your cat to a vet for regular check-ups. Pay special attention to your cat's nose and ears, as these senses now make life easier for your cat.\n\n\nKeep your cat\u2019s food and water in the same place they have always been kept.\nConsider adding a second litter box to make it easier for your cat to get to the bathroom in time. It may take her longer to find the box now that she is blind."}

Also offer good image quality and are usually simple to operate.\nProfessional Camera: Can easily cost more than $1,000, but offer the best possible image quality to consumers. A good choice for documentaries, etc.\nSmartphone: Most modern phones have a built-in video camera. Image quality and storage capacity are usually much more limited.\n These mics offer better sound quality than the built-in mics in cameras and smartphones. Find a mic that clips onto the interviewee's shirt (called a lavalier or \"lav\" mic) for a hands-free solution.\n Except in special circumstances, you'll probably want to throw out footage where you don't get one of these.\n\n\nUse a tripod to keep your camera steady. If you don't have one, you may be able to prop the camera on sturdy objects like books. (This is not recommended for expensive or fragile equipment.)\nMost modern cameras will automatically focus on whatever you point them at. If yours doesn't, manually adjust the focus until the interviewee's face is crystal clear. The background doesn't have to be in focus.\n In general, you'll want to shoot somewhere with soft, warm lighting that clearly illuminates your subject without making things uncomfortably bright. If you have access to a professional three-light setup, use this. This link contains good instructions for lighting an interview like a professional.If you don't have professional lights, try simply positioning a lamp a few feet away off-camera.\nLook for any odd, distracting shadows, especially on your subject's face. Move or adjust your lighting to get them to disappear.\nUnless you know what you're doing, avoid shooting outside. If you don't have the right equipment, clear days can often make your footage uncomfortably bright, while overcast days can make it look dim.\nAvoid harsh fluorescent lighting. No one looks good in it.\n It may seem logical to have your subject look straight into the camera, but this is actually a big \"no-no\" in the world of interviewing.Instead, stand slightly to the side of the camera and have your subject face you and maintain eye contact while s/he speaks. This gives the interviewee a less-intimidating \"off-camera\" look.\n Position the camera at eye level in front of the interviewee. Adjust the zoom so that the subject's head is in the center of the frame.\n\n\nDon't zoom in too far. Ideally, you want to be able to see part of the interviewee's neck and upper body as well as some of the background.\n Try to position your subject so that there's nothing behind him or her that might distract from the interview itself. When in doubt, simply shoot the subject from across a table or desk \u2014 it gives the impression that the audience is actually having a conversation with the subject.\n\n\nThis advice doesn't mean there should be nothing in the background. One common strategy is to put things in the background that relate to the subject's occupation or expertise. For instance, if you're interviewing a doctor, shooting in her office with a few medical degrees in the background is a good idea.\n To keep things visually interesting, try shooting from more than one frame. If you have more than one camera, you can shoot multiple angles at once and switch between them as needed during the editing phase. If you only have one camera, wait until your subject finishes answering a question to switch the angle. Otherwise, the mid-question \"jump\" will be too jarring.\n\n"}

People often assume that a child with SM is just really shy, or perhaps that he or she is deliberately not speaking as a ploy to get attention or \u201cmake a scene.\u201d Don\u2019t be fooled, though \u2014 selective mutism is very real and is not under the control of the person with the condition.SM is an anxiety disorder, so yelling at or punishing a child will almost certainly backfire by causing even more anxiety.\nDon\u2019t ignore the condition by saying \u201coh, she\u2019s just quiet,\u201d or have a huge celebration any time a person with SM speaks up in a social situation. Treat it as a real and manageable condition.\nSM won\u2019t just \u201cgo away\u201d if you ignore it. In fact, it may get worse as a child grows up. So don\u2019t delay in seeking a diagnosis and treatment.;\n, Building a healthy, close relationship with a child (or adult) with SM is one of the first steps toward overcoming the condition. The more comfortable and confident the person is in speaking with you about thoughts or feelings, the more capable he or she will be to manage the anxiety that comes with interacting with strangers or larger groups.Spend time with the individual. Promote conversation by asking questions (\u201cWhat are you building with those blocks?\u201d \u201cWhat do those clouds look like to you?\u201d \u201cIf you could go anywhere in the world, where would it be?\u201d). Build up trust and comfort (a \u201csafe space\u201d) so that the person is completely comfortable in expressing his or her feelings.\n Everyone with SM experiences the condition differently. Some do fine in a school classroom but can\u2019t speak in front of a single stranger. Some can speak in front of the same group of people in one setting but not in another. Additionally, other sources of anxiety might exacerbate the condition, and calming influences might moderate it. Identifying these \u201ctriggers\u201d can help significantly with treatment.Especially if your loved one with SM is an older child or adult, you may be able to identify anxiety triggers (job stress, relationship troubles, money issues, etc.) that exacerbate the condition. Helping the person to manage these stressors may help to manage SM as well.\n\n"}

People who have had a heart attack describe the pain as discomfort, chest tightness, a squeezing sensation, burning or an uncomfortable pressure or heaviness in the middle of the chest. This chest pain is called \"Angina.\"\n\n\nThe pain may come and go. It typically starts out mild, gradually intensifies and peaks within the next few minutes.\nPain does not worsen when applying pressure to the chest or when taking deep breaths, if it is the result of a heart attack.\nTypically this chest pain is brought on by exertion, any type of exercise or yard work, even a heavy meal in your blood as your blood flows and is moved towards your gastrointestinal tract. If the symptoms occur at rest, it is termed \u201cUnstable Angina, and poses a greater risk of a lethal heart attack.Women and diabetics are more likely to experience atypical angina.;\n, There are several reasons you could be having chest pain. The most common are indigestion, panic attacks, a pulled muscle, and heart attacks.If you have just eaten a rich meal or have just done a hard chest workout, you probably are having the symptoms due to reasons other than a heart attack.\nIf you can't think of another reason for the symptoms, then assume you are having a heart attack and seek out help as soon as possible.\n During a heart attack, most people will have chest pain along with at least one other symptom. You often experience shortness of breath, dizziness or palpitations, sweating, or you may feel sick to your stomach and vomit.\n\n\nCommon heart attack symptoms include feeling a choking sensation or a lump in the throat, heartburn, indigestion, or the need to swallow repeatedly.\nA person having a heart attack may perspire and become chilled at the same time. She or he may have periods of cold sweats.\nHeart attack victims may feel numbness in either arm, hand or both.\nSome people experience a rapid and irregular heartbeat, heart palpitations, or shortness of breath.\nLook for atypical symptoms. For instance, although uncommon, the patient may feel a sharp or dull pain or ache in the middle of the chest.\n Disease of the coronary arteries, coronary plaques, and atheromas are more complex conditions than CAD but they can result in the same blockage of the arteries to the heart. For instance, coronary \u201cplaques\u201d are a layer of cholesterol in the lining in the artery that creates small tears where at different times the plaque has started to tear away from the artery wall. Blood clots have formed at the site of tiny tears on the inside lining of the artery and the body has responded to this with more inflammation.Since this progression of the plaque can occur slowly over time patients may experience periods of chest pain or discomfort and ignore it. Or specifically only experience it when they are under increased cardiac stress.\nThe patient may consequently not seek any medical treatment until the plaque has gotten so big as to stop blood flow significantly even when the person is at rest, when cardiac demand is low.\nOr worse, when the plaque breaks off and blocks flow altogether, causing a heart attack. This can happen anytime, and for many this is the first sign that they are having a heart attack.\n When you seek evaluation for your symptoms, most specifically chest pain, the next most important factor or perhaps equally important, is your \u201crisk factor profile.\" We have so much data and evidence regarding CAD that we know it occurs more often in certain populations. Cardiovascular Risk Factors (CVRF) include: being male, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, obesity (BMI greater than 30), age greater than 55 years, and a family history of heart disease.\n\n\nThe more risk factors you possess, the more likely the symptoms you are experiencing are due to underlying CAD. Knowing these risk factors will allow your healthcare provider to evaluate your symptoms, depending on how likely they are due to coronary disease.\n\n"}

If you do not think your friendship (or pocketbook) can withstand an unpaid loan, break the news as gently as possible to your friend. Remember to be as honest as you can.\n\n\nFor example, you could say to your friend, \"I know you are in a tight spot financially. I really value our friendship, but friends and loans just do not get along. Is there some other way I can help out?\u201d Or, \u201cI just don\u2019t have the extra cash myself to lend. If I could give you the money, I would.\u201d\n\n, If you know you won't be supporting a donation request, express the importance of the request, turn it down, and give an alternative, if you can.For example, \"It sounds like you're working on a great cause, but I just can't work it in right now. I've already pledged my monthly donation funds. You might try x business or ask me again next month.\"\n\n\nDon't feel obligated to donate to every request. Chances are, you're focusing on your time, business, or finances. Say yes to projects that you really can or want to commit to., Most kids don't like just being told not to do something. If your child wants something that you're not going to give or allow, firmly say no and explain why you're not allowing it. Make sure to express their point of view and then suggest something that they can have or can do.For example, you might say, \"No, you can't spend the night at your friend's house during the school week. I don't want you to be too tired for class the next day. I know you're frustrated, but you can always spend the night over the weekend.\"\n\n, Never feel obligated when someone asks you for a huge favor. After all, the person probably has no idea what your work or stress load is currently like. You have the choice to say no, even to a personal favor. If the person is a good enough friend, she should understand and not press you.For example, you might say, \"I really wish I could babysit for you this week, but I've got a really big work deadline and a family obligation.\" Be clear and honest. Don't lie, which could hurt your relationship in the long run.\n Be direct and clear to make sure the other person gets the message. In romantic situations, people tend to take any ambiguity as a sign of hope, which isn't fair or pleasant for anyone involved. Polite ways to be blunt include \"You're (a good friend / a nice guy), but I'm not interested in you that way,\" or, \"We're not quite a match.\"If you just went on the date and have been asked to go on another one, you should be as honest, but gentle as you can. Try saying something like, \"I enjoyed this evening, but I don't think you and I are a good fit.\"\nCut the conversation short once you've turned someone down. Most likely, neither of you will be happy trying to spend time together immediately afterward.\n If a romantic partner is pressuring you to start having sex, or act more intimate than you are comfortable with, firmly decline with a straightforward \"No.\" If necessary, mention a reason, such as the chance of pregnancy, your moral beliefs, or simply that you will make the decision on your own schedule. Let the other person know that this is your personal decision, and has nothing to do with his or her attractiveness.Don't assume that your partner will pick up on your lack of enthusiasm and simply stop. You need to be clear.\n If you're being repeatedly hounded to go on a date or start having sex, it's time to be extra firm. If someone doesn't listen to your polite responses, another firm \"No\" is necessary. Here are some examples of followup responses to try:\n\n\nSay, \"I'm uncomfortable with your constant asking, so I'm going to have to say no.\"\nTell your friend or partner that the behavior is making you sad or upset.\nTurn down requests to spend time together.\nDon't get invested in the opinion of a stranger or acquaintance. If you can, stop seeing the person completely.\n First, thank him or her, and say that you're honored to be asked by such a wonderful person. Say you're not going to accept, but it's not because of anything he or she did. Finally, offer a full explanation of why you are turning down the proposal, including all the specifics in your situation.\n\n\nThis advice applies to someone in a serious relationship with you. If someone you only started dating proposes, gently say \"That's sweet, but it's way too early.\"\nIf someone proposes to you in public, prevent embarrassment by keeping the moment short and sweet. Try \"I love you, and I want to talk about it in private.\" Don't create a big scene or dramatic refusal.\n\n"}

Instead of harvesting all the ears at once, you should expect to harvest the top ears off your stalks first.\n\n\nThe top ear should be visibly plumper than the other ears on the stalk. It will become so plump, in fact, that it should start to lean away from the stalk so much so that it is nearly perpendicular with it.;\n, Feel the corn to determine if it is consistently plump throughout the cob and check the silks coming off the ear to verify that they are dry.\n\n\nThe silks should turn brown and feel quite dry. If you try to handle the silks, they should also peel or fall off in your hand without much effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the silks will be tinted red and will feel soft and wet if the corn is not yet ripe.\nFeel the end of the ear to determine whether or not it has filled out completely. A mature ear will have a rounded or blunt end, but an unripe ear will feel pointed.\nIt is best to harvest corn as soon as it matures on the stalk. Ears of corn contain the most sugar at peak maturity, so they will be sweetest as soon as they turn ripe. The ears of corn gradually lose sweetness as they remain on the stalk since the corn starts to convert its sugars into starches at that point.\n If you are not quite certain about whether or not an ear is ready for harvest, you can peel back a small amount of the husk and check the kernels underneath. The end of the ear should look filled out and the kernels should be a creamy yellow or white color.Test the ear further by piercing a kernel with your thumbnail. The liquid inside the kernel should be white or milky in appearance. If the liquid seems watery or clear, the corn is still unripe. If the liquid seems too creamy, the corn might be overripe.\nYou should avoid opening the husk unless you cannot check for ripeness any other way. An unripe, open ear of corn is vulnerable to attacks by birds and insects.\n Removing corn from the stalk is a simple process. You should be able to grab and ear and pull it downward, then twist it off by hand.If possible, harvest the corn from the stalk in the morning. The ears are still fairly cool at this point, and the conversion of sugar to starch slows down in cooler temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteady the cornstalk with one hand and use the other hand to twist the corn of the stalk. It should come off in your hands. You should not need to use shears to remove the ears of corn from the stalk.\n The conversion of sugar to starch speeds up after you harvest corn, so to maintain maximum sweetness and flavor, try to eat the corn within 24 hours of harvesting it.\n\nNote that super-sweet varieties can stay sweeter for longer periods of time, but traditional varieties will convert more than half their sugar content to starch after the first 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can slow the rate at which corn converts its sugars to starch by keeping the corn cold. Lay the ears in single layers inside a refrigerator and cover them with a damp cloth to keep the corn as cool as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the refrigerator, corn should retain its sweetness for about a week.\n After the top ear becomes ripe enough, the remaining ears of corn on the stalk should ripen in another ten days or so.\n\n\nMost corn plants will yield a minimum of two ears per stalk, if not more. Hybrids tend to produce more than pure varieties."}

She may feel more at ease if she sits in the back seat where she can stretch out.You may want to keep blankets and pillows in the car to make her even more comfortable.\n If the woman's water hasn't broken, be prepared in case it breaks while you're driving. Lay a thick towel down on the seat and have a few more in case she needs to wipe herself off as well. You should also travel with a plastic bag for the woman to use if she develops nausea and needs something to vomit into.Some women may still experience leaking even after their waters break, so it's a good idea to put down a towel anyway.\n Play relaxing music or use scents that soothe the laboring woman so her labor continues to progress. Many women find that the stress of traveling to the hospital causes the labor to stall or temporarily stop. Consider spritzing a little perfume or essential oils in the car and turn on soft music. These can relax her and help her labor progress.It's alright if her labor slows down a little. This just means that it may take more time for her labor to pick back up at the hospital.\nSome laboring women prefer quiet, so ask the woman if she'd rather you turn the music off.\n Avoid speeding, running lights, and reckless driving that could put your car and others in danger. Instead, follow the traffic laws to ensure that you make it safely to the hospital. You may even want to drive slower if this makes the woman in labor more comfortable.Try to go slower over bumps, railroad tracks, or through construction. The jostling may be painful for the laboring woman, so taking it slowly can make it easier to handle.\n The laboring woman will pick up on your stress and nervousness which could stall her labor (making it temporarily slow down). Try to remain in control, calm, and confident so she can focus on making it through contractions. Practice any breathing exercises you learned birthing classes, repeat a mantra, or visualize a safe arrival at the hospital.Remember that it's alright if you don't feel calm and confident. You just need to display outward control of the situation. Once she realizes that you can safely get her to the hospital, she'll feel more comfortable.\n\n"}

Look at the letters that make up your name, and think about how you can best emphasize them: note the interesting letters (with a lot of loops, dots, and crosses, like G, X, or B) and the plain letters (especially those that look similar between uppercase and lowercase, like S or O). Look for any areas that could become focal points of your signature.;\n, A simple and clear signature will be easier for people to read, but a more complex signature might show more flair. The more flourish you put into your signature, the more flamboyant you may seem. Consider how your signature might speak to the luxury of time. Busy doctors often scrawl hasty, illegible signatures, whereas famous writers often take the time to orchestrate intricate designs.Signatures that include just your initials (with or without the middle initial) are usually considered more formal and businesslike than full-name signatures.\nIf you\u2019re worried about forgery, consider making your signature longer and more legible. Include your entire first and last name. Be sure to write clearly. It is easier to forge scribbled signatures than it is to copy the nuances of a practiced, legible signature.\n Some people sign their full name, and some sign only their first or last name. Some just use their initials. If you are known only by your first or last name\u2014like Beyonce or Ronaldo\u2014 then you might consider using just the first name. If you are a professor who typically goes by their last name, you may just sign your surname.\n Look at the signatures of famous people, and consider whether you want to emulate anybody. Kurt Vonnegut, Walt Disney, Salvador Dali, Picasso, and John Hancock (among many others) are all known for their unique signature styles. Don't be afraid to borrow eye-catching elements and add them to your own signature., Rewrite your signature over and over to explore the possibilities. Have fun with it. Play with a variety of styles and flourishes. See what feels comfortable to write, looks good with your name, and isn\u2019t too hard to copy repeatedly. Use a writing tool that feels right in your hand. Consider using pencil if you want to erase and rework your signature.\n Make a letter larger so that it stands out, or make it very small so that it blends in. This can give your signature a bold look without slowing your signing time down to a crawl. Try exaggerating the first letter of your name, or the first letters of your first and last name.If your signature is messy or curly, you can emphasize one letter by making it sharp and clear. Likewise, make a single letter sloppy or fancy if you want it to stand out from an otherwise clean-cut signature.\n This is a classic way to make your name look more ornate. Underlining can also take more time to write out than a simpler style \u2013 so consider whether it's worth it.\n\n\nTurn one of your letters into an underline. This is commonly done with the last letter, but feel free to add a flourish to any letter that lends itself to the style. Letters with a long tail (y, g, j) are perfect. Drag the tail out beneath the signature.\nUnderline your signature with loops. This is a very fluid, ornate way to spice up a signature.Underline your signature with zig-zags. These are similar to loops, but spikier and more angular.\n Double up on your horizontal crosses, and end your looped letters in hooks and flourishes. Use a fountain pen, if possible. Draw inspiration from calligraphy, from old signatures, and from Gothic lettering. This adds flair to even a simple signature.\n This can be a great way to make your style more unique. Look for letters that lend themselves to an exciting twist, and experiment with ways to make them look fancier. Try the following ideas:\n\n\nUse repeating elements. The three large ovals in this signature create an echo effect and help tie the whole design together.\nAllow your capital letters to encircle the lowercase letters. This is a useful way to spice up a name that doesn\u2019t have any lower loops (g, j, etc.) to play with.\nEncircle the signature with loops. This creates a very regal, official-looking signature.\nEnlarge the bottoms of your letters. This is one of the simplest and most common ways to spruce up a signature.\n The symbols might include a team jersey number, a simple sketch, or a graduation year. If you associate a specific number or symbol with your identity (for instance, if you are well-known for your role on a sports team), this may be a good way to publicly distinguish yourself from people with similar names. If you want to go this route, it\u2019s best to keep the rest of your signature straightforward to save time. Too many symbols can overwhelm the design and make for a long signing process.\n Find pieces of signatures that you like. Consider what works, what doesn't, and what suits your personality. As you practice your signature, tweak small details and flourishes until you've come up with something that feels right.\n Don't pick a signature only because it looks cool. Choose a signature that is stylistic, but also practical.\n\n\nYour signature should be easy to write and reproduce. It should feel good coming off of your hand, and it should be simple enough that you can dash it off in a matter of seconds.\nYour signature should suit your purpose and personality. If you want to show your dramatic side, use a signature with flair. If you want to tell people that you are neat and ordered, your signature should reflect that.\nYour signature should be identifiable. It shouldn't just look like a scribble on the page \u2013 unless it's a recognizable scribble, and it comes out like that every time. Make your signature unique so that people know it's yours.\n Remember that you can always change it, up to a point. If you use a certain signature on all of your legal documents (driver's license, passport, credit card, bank records) then it may be inconvenient to change it. In some cases, your signature actually serves to identify you, and you may arouse suspicion if you sign in a way that doesn't match the records.\n The coolest, most complicated signature in the world is useless if you can't quickly sign it onto new documents. As you practice your signature, think about practicality: consider how fast you can sign it, whether you need any special writing tools, and whether you can make it look the same each time. If you can't easily reproduce your signature, you might want to simplify your design.\n\n\nBear in mind that this does not apply to digital signatures. Most digital document-signing applications will save your personalized signature for later use. Sign it right once, and you can copy it to any future document. However. it may be wise to keep your digital signature consistent with your analog signature."}

For extremely oily skin, a detergent facial soap may be considered, but this may be too harsh and dry out your skin too much.\n When you\u2019re washing your face, use hot water; this will break down the oil more effectively than cold or warm water is able to.

Define your goals in your business plan and mission statement. A software company might want to emphasize the quality and simplicity of its products (hence, Apple) while an accounting firm might want to emphasize its accuracy.;\n, You need an understanding of both what your prospective customers are like and what they're looking for when they come to you. If your target customers are wealthy, you might want to have a name that caters to their upscale tastes. If your target customers are working mothers who don't have time to clean house, you'll want to consider a name that either recognizes their busy schedules, their desire for cleanliness and order, or both.\n In one column, list the qualities you want to convey to your customers. What are you \"about\"? In another column, list things you think your customers are looking for. Use nouns, adjectives and verbs as possibilities.\n\n\nCome up with a wide variety of words that are specific to your business. \"Rover\" might be good if you plan to open a dog-walking business while \"persimmon\" might be a great word for a Lebanese restaurant.\nConsult a dictionary to look up definitions of the words you choose and a thesaurus to find synonymous words or phrases. You can also use a software application designed to help you brainstorm.\n Trendy upscale restaurants will often have short, punchy names that emphasize simplicity and quality, like \"Fig\" or \"Feast.\" Likewise, \"Timberland\" shoe specializes in work boots and their simple, earthbound name reflects their product nicely, whereas \"Tom's\" emphasizes its personal human touch.\n \"Black Cyprus\" or \"North Face\" are both evocative and versatile. One noun and one modifier allow for both simplicity and accuracy, as with the name \"Urban Outfitters\" or \"American Apparel.\"\n\n\nTry a gerund verb phrase. A gerund is simply an \"-ing\" word. This tends to make your business sound active and fun, a place with a welcoming atmosphere: \"Laughing Planet\" is an organic burrito chain, while \"Turning Leaf\" is a wine producer.\n Incorporating someone's real name into your business is a great way to lend a personal touch, even if it's not a real person. McDonald's was never owned by anyone named \"McDonald,\" while Papa John's pizza chain is owned by someone named \"John.\"\n\n, A portmanteau is a word made up of two words, like \"KitchenAid\" \"Microsoft\" or \"RedBox.\" This lends an experimental edge to your business and makes it sound fresh and contemporary. You're inventing a word, essentially, so it makes a lot of sense for entrepreneurial endeavors.\n Some simple sonic literary devices can lend your business name a memorable quality:\n\n\nRepeating the initial sounds of words, called alliteration, plays to both sight and sound, in business names such as \"Papyrus Press,\" \"K-Dee's Coffee\" \"Smith Sound.\" Similar to alliteration is assonance, which plays to the rhyming of vowel sounds. \"Blue Moon Pools\" is an example of assonance.\nRhyming, whether exact or inexact rhymes, can make a memorable business name. \"The Reel Deal\" might make sense as a dollar theatre or a fishing shop.\nPlaying off a colloquial saying is another way to come up with a memorable business name. A bar called \"Liquid Courage\" or a coffee shop called \"Common Grounds\" employ this. The risk of picking a corny or clich\u00e9d name is significant with this technique, but try it out to give your list as many names as possible to work with. You can always scratch it later.\nMaking a historical, literary or mythological reference can be successful. \"Starbucks,\" after all, is named after a character in Moby-Dick.\n Shorter names are easier to remember than longer ones. The Texas Oil Company shortened its name to Texaco and it's hard to imagine \"Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web\" having been as successful if they hadn't decided on the shorter \"Yahoo.\"Even if you're using words that are made-up or use creative spellings, make sure they make some level of sense for the product or service. \"U-Haul\" and \"Flickr\" work despite their text-speak because they are accurate names for the business, not because they are spelled strangely. Naming your salon \"d' verse tease\" is too clever for its own good.\n It might seem like the best idea in the world to name your construction business \"Daedalus Construction\" because you've studied your Greek mythology, but alienating customers by risking going over their heads is a risk.\n\n\nThis is where knowing your audience comes in: a comics shop named \"Jim Gordon's\" might appeal to the Batman-obsessives while alienating the average reader though average readers tend not to shop in comics shops anyway. Think of it as a tradeoff. Upscale restaurants in expensive districts can get away with naming their restaurant something French, but it might be a bad idea in West Memphis, where your clientele might be made to feel excluded, or not \"in the know.\"\n\n, Too often, an adjective becomes train-wrecked into a noun, and a terrible business name is born, like QualiTrade or AmeriBank. Names like this lack personality and your business won't stand out in a market saturated with similar-style names.\n\n\nIf your business name includes Ameri, Tech, Corp, or Tron as prefix or suffix, you might want to reconsider and come up with a name that's less saturated.\n Geographically-specific names will lock your business into a particular niche that will require changing the company name if it grows outside that niche. \"Omaha Pipe and Drain\" will work for a plumbing repair business in the metropolitan Omaha area, but it won't help a plumbing contractor land a pipefitting contract in Des Moines or Kansas City. \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" officially changed its name to \"KFC\" recently for this very reason.\n Everyone called Bob Dylan's backup band \"The Band.\" One day, it just stuck and they would be \"The Band\" forever. If everyone has taken to calling your copy shop \"Main Street Copy,\" don't risk changing it to \"The Awesome Copy Super Fantastic Fun Shop\" because the given name isn't exciting enough. In the end, your product or service is the most important thing and the name is the package it comes in. If it's already got one that works, don't change it.\n\n\nAlternatively, know when you've picked a name that doesn't work and take the risk of changing it. Even if you already ordered \"TACSFFS Rules\" magnets for all the workers at the Main St. Copy joint, take the hit and go with the name that works.\n Once you have a list of favorites, you need to make sure no one else has trademarked any of them. There are several resources you can use to see if the name is already in use.\n\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office maintains a Public Search Facility at its office in Alexandria, Virginia as well as branch Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries. The most convenient way to search is through its free online Trademark Electronic Search System database. You can then enter the registration or a serial number of any mark you find into the Trademark Applications and Retrieval Database to find out whether the trademark is currently registered or has lapsed.\nSome states maintain their own trademark registries, usually through the secretary of state's office. Other states maintain databases of fictitious names and corporate names used by businesses, either at the state level or county by county. Consult with your county clerk's office to find out how your state maintains its databases.\nThe Thomas Register lists business names and registered trade and service marks, as well as unregistered marks. It's available online or you can consult a printed copy at your local library., It's more than just a name you'll be registering--it's your whole concept and model for your business. You'll need to provide a clear representation of what you want to register.If you want to have a word, slogan, design, or combination of these things trademarked, you'll have to be able to provide a \"basis\" for filing, which is essentially an argument for why a trademark is necessary for your business.\n\n\nA trademark and a servicemark are distinguished in terms of providing a product (trademark) or a service (servicemark).\n Fill out the application on-line, pay the necessary fees, and keep track of your application.You might consult with a trademark lawyer over the course of the process to make sure you're not missing anything.\n\n"}

Place the cue ball far enough from the cushion to allow for your normal range of motion when using a cue, then add an additional 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135cm) of space to allow an even flatter, steadier cue.Note that the cue ball must be placed behind the \"head string.\" If the head string isn't drawn on the table, find it by looking for the \"diamonds\" or marks on the table's sides, and counting to the second pair of diamonds from the table's end. The imaginary line between this pair of diamonds is the head string.\n The more in line the cue ball is with the rack, the easier the shot will be.As you get better at breaking, you can try more advanced breaking techniques described below. But while you're a beginner, stick with the center placement.\n For the basic break shot, aim for the center of the cue ball, not above or below it.If you notice your cue ball has backspin or forward spin, try watching the tip of your pool cue as you shoot to look for unintentional movements. Practice an even motion while shooting, keeping your elbow level to avoid shifting the pool cue up or down.\n For a powerful break shot, you'll need to stay balanced as you hit the cue ball, then follow through by moving forward. Many players stand slightly to the side of the ball to allow the cue a full range of motion, and may bend at the knees before they strike, encouraging a fluid follow through.\n Following through, or continuing to move the cue forward after striking the ball, is an excellent way to practice and evaluate your break shots.Accelerate the cue through the ball, so you continue to move in one fluid motion rather than stopping or moving jerkily after the ball is struck. Keep your eyes down near the cue and watch the cue ball as you follow through. If the cue does not move in line with the cue ball, practice shooting steadily and accurately until it does before you concentrate on strength.\n The most common place to aim, and the easiest, is the one ball, at the nearest point on the rack. If the cue ball is not in line with the diamond, try not to let the diamond shape confuse your aim. Focus on the single ball you are aiming for, and try to hit the exact center of that ball.\n It's better to hit the cue ball softly and aim correctly, rather than break hard and fast but lose control of your cue ball.If your cue ball often misses or \"scratches,\" meaning it ends up fouled by falling in a pocket, try to shoot more gently. Practice stronger \"power breaks\" once you are able to consistently hit the center of the ball you are aiming for.\n\n"}

This can be a complex decision. For beginners, it\u2019s a good idea to start with a basic, white or light colored cotton or canvas fabric. As you learn and experiment with different materials, you\u2019ll have to keep some other things in mind as well:\n\n\nChoose a fabric that compliments the item that the embroidery will be on.\nChoose a firm fabric with a good thread count (28 or higher), especially if the design will involve heavy items like ribbon or buttons.;\n, First things first, for serious projects make sure you\u2019re getting embroidery floss and not \u201ccraft thread\u201d or similar looking products. These are ill suited to embroidery because the thread is much lower quality and the color can bleed. However, for small test projects and learning exercises, it can be perfectly useful and more economical.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to adjust the weight (thread count) of the floss to the level of detail you\u2019re trying to create. The more detailed the project, the thinner the floss should be. The more bold the design, the thicker the floss should be.\nDon\u2019t worry too much about the type of embroidery floss you buy. There are many types but generally of the thinner threads, the only impact is on the final look (whether it comes out shiny or more matte in finish). Beginners shouldn\u2019t worry about this.\nBe careful not to buy embroidery thread, since this is designed to be used with a machine.\n For your first, basic projects you\u2019ll want to get a basic embroidery needle. A size 12-18 needle is a good starting point for canvas embroidery. Some needles have sharp points while others have blunt points but for beginners, a sharp point will get you through most starting projects.\n You\u2019ll need an embroidery hoop of a reasonable size for your design. You\u2019ll also need a method of transferring your design onto the fabric (discussed in the following section). There are also other helpful extras like thimbles and needle threaders that can make your life much easier (and less painful!).\n When you\u2019re first starting, it\u2019s a good idea to stick to something as basic as possible. Go for clean lines, not too much area to be filled, and larger shapes. It takes awhile to develop the dexterity to do detailed, fine work, so go with these basic designs for now.\n\n\nGood beginner shapes include: flowers, stars, and simple line art.\nYou can find designs online or you can draw or trace one of your own.\n You\u2019ll have to decide on a method for applying the design you found or made onto your fabric. For beginners working with simple fabrics, tracing is probably the easiest. You can also get iron on transfers, but these tend to leave the design looking fuzzy, so be aware of that. If you\u2019re brave, you can draw the design freehand.\n\n\nYou can also try things like water-soluble fabric, which allows you to trace or print the design onto the temporary fabric and embroider directly onto it with the backing fabric underneath.\nStencils are also a good option when you\u2019re first learning how to embroider, especially since those designs tend to be simple.\n Before you can continue, you need to know what goes where in your design. What areas will be filled? What color will they be? What sections are in the background vs foreground? This is crucial in making sure that your project goes smoothly. Not planning ahead is like getting in car without a map and just expecting to end up in New York City.\n Embroidery hoops\u2014which you should not skip on\u2014are formed by two wooden circles with a clasp that holds them together. The inner circle goes on the backside of your fabric and the outer circle goes on the front side that you will be embroidering. Fit them together and then tighten the screw holding the frames together.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll want to be extra sure that the fabric is taut. This is the point of the hoop after all!\n\n, Cut a length of floss to embroider with. The floss\u2019s length will depend on how much area you want to embroider, what kind of stitches you\u2019re doing, and how thick the floss and fabric are. Generally, you do not want the doubled up thread to be longer than your arm, since this will be a pain to have to pull, but you can do it if the project calls for that much continuous thread.\n Thread the floss onto the embroidery needle, just like how you\u2019d thread a normal sewing needle. This is why using an embroidery needle is important though: the eye is much longer to accommodate the extra threads. However, unlike sewing, you won\u2019t double up the entire length of the thread. Instead, you will only double up part of it, leaving a long tail to embroider with and a short tail of about 3\u201d that will be extra.\n Before you put the thread to fabric, it\u2019s important to understand where the threads are going to go. In embroidery, you generally want to start with background items and move forward, as parts of the design get closer to you. This is so that you can overlap your stitches between colors and sections to create depth.\n Before you start stitching, you\u2019ll need to create some kind of stopper to keep the floss from coming right back out of the fabric. When you\u2019re first starting, making a knot at the end of the long tail is probably easiest. As you get more skilled, you\u2019ll want to switch to using a waste knot, since this will keep extra bulk to a minimum.\n When you do finally start your stitches, it\u2019s a good idea to start at a joint or corner. This will create a more natural, flowing look. Look for spots where one object touches another. If your design is very basic, like a circle, you just have to pick a spot and start.\n When you work on projects, you of course want to dive right in and get to the fun! But it\u2019s a good idea to do a test section with the combination of fabric, needle, and floss that you will be using. This allows you to make sure that the final product looks good and you have the size of all of the various parts adjusted correctly.\n\n\nSatin stitches make good test stitches.\n When you've got down the basics, you want to work towards making your more even, clean, and aligned. Very even stitching is generally considered the mark of a good embroiderer. This is a skill that comes through practice and you will get it with time. Just be sure to pay attention and aim to have even stitches.\n As you get better, you\u2019ll want to take on more and more interesting projects. These usually require fine, detailed stitches however. You\u2019ll need to work on your dexterity, aim, and eye in order to do the really fine embroidery that the seasoned pros do. Like even stitches, this is a skill that comes from practice, so make an effort.\n As with any craft, it\u2019s very important to start slow and really work your way up to more complex pieces. If you try to take on too much right at the beginning, it\u2019s easy to get frustrated or feel like you can\u2019t learn how to do it...which isn\u2019t true. You can do this! Just keep trying!\n\n,"}

Plastic is lightweight and easy to store, but it can be difficult to clean. You'll need to discard any plastic cutting boards that develop knife scars or ridges. Wood cutting boards have natural antiseptic properties that can help keep them clean. You can also use bamboo, but since it's harder than wood, it may dull your knives faster.Avoid chopping on metal, glass, or stone cutting boards. These can dull your knives.\nConsider getting two cutting boards. Use one to chop vegetables or fruit and use the other to chop meat.;\n, If you choose to use a plastic cutting board or your work surface is a little slick, you'll need to prevent the cutting board from slipping around. This could cause the knife to slip and cut you. To keep the cutting board in place, lay a damp cloth on the work surface. Set the cutting board directly on the cloth. The board should not slide around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could also use non-slip mats, wet paper towels, or poster putty underneath the cutting board.\n Most knife sets include a variety of knives that you'll use for different kitchen jobs. To chop, you'll usually want to use an 8 to 10-inch (20 to 25 cm) chef's knife. It has a slight curve, so you can rock the knife back and forth as you quickly chop. The knife should feel a little heavy and balanced when you hold it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't chop food with small knives (like paring knives) since the knife could become stuck in the food or you may cut yourself.\nAvoid using it for small jobs, like peeling food or cutting bread.\n Professional chefs sharpen their blades every day because they use them so often. Be in the habit of sharpening your knife blade using a sharpening stone since dull knives are more likely to slip while you're using them. This can increase your risk of cutting yourself. If you don't feel comfortable sharpening your own knives, you can send your knives away to a professional sharpening service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the knife blade has been bent off center because of frequent use, you can also use a honing steel to push the blade back into balance."}

It may be breezy and cold on the coast one day and then the next day your travels could bring you to the outback where the climate will be much different.\nThis is also important if you plan to hit the near by islands of New Zealand or Fiji. Both are easily accessible but will require much different apparel.\n Video chats are a great way to keep in touch with family and friends while you are abroad. Video chat are more personal than phone calls and when you can see the people who you miss face to face it makes it much easier to not get homesick.\n\n\nSkype is a great way to keep in touch because not only can you use it to video chat but you can also use it to call land lines to people like parents or grandparents who may not be able to figure out how to use video chat. Call to land lines through Skype are much cheaper than calling cards or international phone plans, it costs pennies per minute. Plus, most hostel computers have this program on their computers already for you to keep in touch while traveling as well.\n It won't be hard to find people who want to talk to you about your country or offer you advice on where to go. Australians are very friendly people who don\u2019t hesitate to strike up a conversation at a local bar or sporting event, especially if your accent stands out.\n\n\nTherefore it is important to make friends with the locals and other travelers you may come across. These are the people who are going to tell you about places and things to see that may not be as well known or in all the travel books.\nDon\u2019t be surprised if you live in campus housing if many people in your dorms offer for you to come home with them on the weekends.

What do you hope to accomplish with your protest? Figure out who the audience of your protest will be and plan your strategy from there. You're more likely to get the outcome you want if you take time to set a goal for achieving it.\n\n\nFor example, let's say you want to stage a protest at a local factory farm as a way to spread awareness about how animals are treated there so people will stop buying their products. In this case your audience is the public.\nYou may have a more specific goal, like trying to prevent an \"adult\" business from moving into your neighborhood. In this case the aim of the protest might be to put pressure on the property owner to lease the building to a different business of which the community approves.\nIn some cases your goal might be quite large in scale, like if you're protesting a war or a governmental policy. In this case the protest can be used as a tool to show political leaders that their constituents want a change in policy.;\n, Find a location that is practical, symbolic or convenient - or all three. The location you choose should be the one that helps you reach your target audience so that the protest is as effective as possible. This could be the sidewalk in front of a business, a public street corner, the courthouse, the capitol building, or a park that has historically been used for protests in your city. Just remember that in order for the protest to be legal, the site you choose must be public.\n Protest at a time when you'll be able to gather the largest crowd and have the greatest impact on your audience. For example, if you're protesting a certain company's business practices you'll want to stage the protest when the CEO is present, which will probably be during business hours. On the other hand, if the goal of your protest is to gather as many people as possible, you might want to protest on a weekend when more people will be available to come.\n Check with your city officials about whether you need to get a permit to protest in the location you choose. Each city has its own laws regarding how many people can protest and where they can gather. Do your homework and get the permits you need so that your protest won't get disbanded before it can gain any traction.\n\n\nIn some cases the permit will set limits on how many people can gather, how much noise you can make, and where protesters can move about. If you disagree with the terms, you can contact an attorney to help you try to get them altered.\nSome cities don't issue protest permits. If you're expecting a large crowd to come to the protest, you should alert the police department anyway. If they know what to expect they can help with crowd control and there will be less chance of conflict occurring.\n What actions will best help you achieve your goal? It's important to have an agenda in mind for what will happen once everyone is gathered for the protest. Do some research on other effective protests and come up with a game plan that will help you target your goal. Here are a few ideas:Have community leaders introduce the protest and make speeches on the issue at hand.\nHave an emcee who can lead protest chants and songs, and have bands play protest music.\nPlan a march from one location to another. This is a classic form of protesting that helps bring widespread attention to a cause.\nImplement performance art to help get your point across.Screen an informative video or documentary on the subject you're protesting.\nConsider having a sit-in or sleep-in - occupying a space until your demands are met.\n Take this important step to make sure your protest gets as much attention as possible. The aim isn't just to encourage people to show up for the protest, but to capture that attention of the media, too. Pull out all the stops to spread the word starting a few weeks before the protest.\n\n\nPost details about the protest on all your social media channels.\nMake flyers about the protest and put them up around town. Target college campuses and other places where people likely to be interested in protesting your issue congregate.\nCall local newspapers and radio stations and ask them to publish information about the protest and promote it on the air.\n Make posters, fliers, visual aids, or pamphlets to help spread your message and communicate your concerns to others. During the protest, you can give out information on what you're protesting to interested parties.\n\n\nYou might want to put the name of the group with which you're affiliated on your protest materials. That way people who are new to the issue will know who to contact to find out more.\nConsider coming up with a catchy slogan for the materials, something people can easily memorize and communicate to others.\n You can keep yourself safer at a protest by dressing appropriately for the occasion. Dress for comfort - you might be standing or walking for several hours - and for safety, just in case you get jostled by the crowd or caught in the middle of an escalating conflict.\n\n\nWear comfortable tennis shoes.\nWear several layers of thick clothing so you have extra padding on your body.\nIf you plan to be on the front lines of a protest that could easily escalate into conflict, wear protective eyewear.\n Bring a backpack with a few supplies you might need. Bottled water and food are good to have on hand if the protest is going to last a long time. In addition to these staples, pack the following in your backpack:\n\n\nA copy of the protest permit\nYour identification card\nA first aid kit\nA bandana soaked in apple cider vinegar, stored in a plastic bag - this is said to help combat the debilitating effects of tear gas long enough for you to get to safety.\n No matter what you're protesting, there will be people who strongly disagree with your point of view. You may even encounter a separate group of protesters protesting the opposite side of the issue. At larger protests, police may be present to control the crowd and make sure things don't get too out of hand. With all these different forces butting heads, be prepared for unpredictable things to happen.\n\n\nDo research on the group you're protesting with. If you weren't one of the organizers, you should know the history of the group before joining the protest. If the group has every used illegal tactics or caused violence at a protest, you might want to think twice before joining them.\nMost protests don't end in violence, but it does happen sometimes. When people feel passionate about an issue, their behavior can be unpredictable. Stay alert and aware of your surroundings when you protest.\n Make sure you know your rights as a protester and are familiar with how to deal with police in case you get stopped by an officer. If you stick to the terms outlined in the protest permit, you shouldn't encounter problems, but you never know what could happen.\n\n\nDo your best to follow the instructions given by both the protest organizers and the police.\nIf you believe your free speech rights are being threatened, speak to the protest organizer or call an attorney.\nIf a police officer asks if he or she can search you, you have the right to decline until a warrant is presented., A protest can be a very effective way to exercise free speech, make your voice heard and bring about change. However, being disrespectful to those against whom you're protesting can undermine your group's reputation and hurt the cause. Your arguments won't be taken as seriously if disrespectful actions are taken. Avoid the following (and encourage fellow protesters to do the same):\n\n\nYelling insults at people who disagree with you\nVandalizing public or private property\nSpitting or throwing water\nResorting to violence of any kind\n\n, If you're considering civil disobedience as part of your protest strategy, think carefully before taking action. Civil disobedience can be a courageous, nonviolent strategy for driving a point home, but it comes with serious consequences, like getting arrested. It's important to know what you're getting into before you choose to break the law in the name of your cause.\n When all is said and done, reflect back on the protest and decide what worked and what didn't. Think about whether you reached your goal, and whether a different approach would be more effective the next time around. No matter what, be proud that you stayed true to your beliefs and exercised your right to be heard. Even if your protest didn't bring about the change you want to see, speaking up about your cause is a step in the right direction.\n\n\nIt's unlikely that a single protest is going to change everything in one blow. You'll probably need to have follow-up protests. Consider approaching the issue from other angles as well. You could start a letter-writing campaign, lead a boycott, write a blog to voice your opinions, and take other actions to spread awareness and accomplish your goals. Don't give up!\n\n"}

But if you and your partner are both inviting your parents, you\u2019ll probably need three small (one-room) cabins.Some cabins are very large and have multiple bedrooms. In such a case, you\u2019d need to figure out how many rooms you\u2019ll need and rent the appropriate number of cabins based on the cabins\u2019 accessibility.\n Talk to everyone you\u2019ve invited to the cabin getaway. How much time do they have to share with you? Remember, most cabin rental agencies require stays of at least two nights or more depending on the time of year. Call the cabin rental agency you\u2019re interested in booking with to find out what the minimum number of nights you can book is.It\u2019s okay if the rest of your friends can\u2019t arrive at the cabin at the same time as you. It\u2019s also okay if they \u2013 or you \u2013 don\u2019t leave at the exact same time. For instance, if your friends can only spend five days with you instead of the full six days you\u2019ll be at the cabin, just have them meet you there (or tell them it\u2019s no problem if they leave early, depending on your schedules).\n Isolated, rustic cabins are tucked away in a natural setting. Alternatively, you could rent a cabin in a resort community, where rows of small cabins sit neatly along a shoreline or in a mountain valley.If you\u2019re heading out alone, or if it\u2019s just you and your partner on your cabin getaway, you might prefer one of the more solitary cabins.\nIf you\u2019re in a big group of friends or family, though, you might want to stay in a resort community where everyone can have their own cabin but still stay in close proximity to each other.\n A truly rustic cabin might not have indoor plumbing or electricity. A more modern cabin will, along with (possibly) wi-fi and a television. Decide how much you want to \u201crough it\u201d when planning your cabin getaway, and choose the cabin that suits the needs of you and your group.\n Choosing the right cabin getaway depends in large part on what you want to do during your getaway. Do you want to go swimming? Rent a cabin on the Great Lakes. Do you want to hike or climb mountains? Try a cabin in the Adirondacks. If you want to do seasonal activities like ski or snowboard, you\u2019ll need to organize your cabin getaway during the winter season., In addition to the self-guided activities you should plan for yourself during the cabin getaway, you should also consider what activities you want to do in the area. For instance, some cabins are located near caves where you can go spelunking. Others are located on lakes where you could rent a jet ski.If you\u2019re unsure what activities and outings are near your cabin, contact the rental agency or landlord.\nPopular cabin rental agencies can be found at https://www.tripping.com/cabins.\nSchedule the activities you want to do ahead of time.\n\n"}
{"title": "How to Handle Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats3", "summary": "look for signs in flat-faced cats.\nnotice mouth breathing.\nlisten for noisy breathing.\nrecognize fainting spells.\nget veterinary care as early as possible.\nallow recommended testing.\ndiscuss the diagnosis with your cat's veterinarian.", "article": " Brachycephalic airway syndrome is a problem in cats that have flat faces. Their flat faces make abnormalities much more likely because there is less room in the cat's head for proper airway development.Persian, Himalayan and Burmese cats are more likely to get brachycephalic airway syndrome than other breeds.\n When a cat cannot breathe very well it is common for it to open its mouth to breathe. This signals that the cat is having difficulty getting enough air in through its nose.A cat will normally breathe through its nose most of the time if its airway is clear.\n Noisy breathing is another sign of trouble in your cat's airway. Noisy breathing happens when the airway is obstructed and air does not have a clear pathway.This can happen when the cat is congested due to sickness, but it can also signal that the airway is compromised if it does not go away once the cat is well.\n In extreme cases of brachycephalic airway syndrome your cat may faint due to lack of oxygen. This signals that the condition is life threatening and and the cat needs veterinary care immediately.It can be difficult to tell the difference between when a cat is sleeping and when it has passed out. However, if you can't wake your cat up easily, then it has likely passed out.\n If you suspect that your cat has difficulty breathing due to brachycephalic airway syndrome, you should have it seen by a veterinarian as soon a possible. If your cat is having a particularly hard time breathing, you should have it seen by a veterinarian immediately.The earlier that the condition is identified and treated, the better the chances are for successful treatment.\nIf your regular veterinary clinic is not open when you notice your cat's breathing problems, take it to an emergency veterinary clinic or hospital.\n There are a variety of tests that may be done on your cat if their veterinarian suspects brachycephalic airway syndrome. Some of these tests can be done while the cat is awake, but some need to be done while the cat is put under anesthesia.\n\nIf your cat needs to be put under to have testing done, your veterinarian will do a variety of tests on it first to make sure that it is healthy enough to undergo anesthesia. Cats with breathing problems can have a hard time under anesthesia, so your vet will want to use extra care when putting the cat under.\nIf your cat is put under anesthesia to have testing done, your veterinarian may suggest that any surgical treatments that need to be done are done then as well. This will limit the risks to your cat that are inherent with anesthesia.\n Brachycephalic airway syndrome is actually a group of abnormalities of the airway. If your veterinarian tells you that your cat has this syndrome, they will then discuss your cat's specific abnormalities within the larger syndrome. There are four types of abnormalities that are included in this syndrome. They include:Stenotic nares: abnormally narrowed, small nostrils\nElongated soft palate: the soft palate is too long for the length of the cat's mouth, blocking the entrance to the trachea or windpipe\nEversion of the laryngeal saccules: sacs or pouches inside the voicebox that go into the airway and inhibit normal airflow\nNarrowing of the trachea\u00a0: the trachea is a smaller diameter than normal\n\n"}

This can manifest as a need to make decisions for others and tell others what to do. The person who is abusing others may expect people to follow his orders without questioning him.Intimidation tactics may include:Making threatening looks or gestures.\nSmashing things in front of the person.\nDestroying property, harming pets, or putting weapons on display.\n Threatening is when the abuser tries to scare the other person into staying with them or possibly drop charges against them. An abuser may threaten the other person, the other person's loved ones, or even to harm himself.Threats can be vague such as, \u201cIf I can't have you, no one can,\u201d or, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get it. You\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d\nThe abuser may threaten to withhold food or other care the person needs.\nKnow that criminal threats are crimes. Report the person to the police if you feel you or someone you know is in danger. You can also ask for a restraining order.\n Social isolation can be a form of control. The abusive person wants the victim to not have close friendships or relationships because this can limit the abusers control. The abusive person knows that the individual may seek help from social supports, and he may want to limit these supports.This may show up as isolating the individual or not allowing the person to be in social situations (such as go out with friends).The abuser may also try to prevent the person from attending school or work., Financial abuse can occur in intimate relationships, as well as against the elderly (called elder abuse). Economic abuse include any of the following:Rigidly controlling finances.\nWithholding money or credit cards.\nForcing the person account for every penny spent.\nWithholding basic necessities (food, clothes, medications, shelter).\nRestricting the person to an allowance.\nPreventing from working or choosing a career.\nSabotaging someone\u2019s job (making one miss work, calling constantly).\nStealing from the person or taking money.\n\n"}

Draw around the visor, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) margin between the edge of the visor and the pencil mark.Repeat this step once so that you have two visor-shaped pieces of orange felt.\nNote that the visor and the pieces of felt will be used to make the beak of the duck costume.\n Cut out both beak pieces of orange felt. Use a glue stick or hot glue gun to adhere the felt to the visor of the cap. One piece should go on top, and the other piece should go on the bottom.\n\n\nThe overlap should slightly hang over the front of the visor. If desired, glue the excess felt overlap of the bottom and top pieces together after securing them onto the visor itself.\n Use black felt. Each circle should be 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter.\n\n\nPosition the two circles at the center top of the beak. They should be placed near the crown portion of the cap, but still on the beak or visor portion.\nThe circles should be placed about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart from one another, with the middle point between the two circles being the center top of the beak.\n Place each pom-pom on the crown portion of the cap. Each one should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the outer side of either nostril and 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) up and away from the visor.\n Cut out two more 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) circles of black felt. Use hot glue to attach these circles to the center front of your two white pom-poms.\n\n\nThis step finishes your duck cap. Set the cap aside as you work on the rest of your costume.\n Find the shoes that you intend to wear with your duck costume. Place each shoe on top of another sheet of orange felt and trace around it in pencil, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) margin between the side of the shoe and the pencil mark.\n\n\nNote that you need to do this with each sneaker so that you will have a foot traced out for both feet.\nFor best results, use a thin shoe for this. You will need to fit a sock on top of this shoe, and doing so might be difficult if you have bulky shoes on.\nAlternatively, you can skip this procedure altogether and take a shortcut. Instead of making specific duck feet, wear orange rain boots with your costume.\n Sketch out three triangular points at the top of each foot design. These points should look like the webbed toes of a duck.\n Use sharp scissors to cut around the outline of each duck foot.\n\n\nNote that you may still see pencil marks on the felt feet after you cut them out. If so, simply designate the marked side of the felt as the bottom side of the foot.\n Carefully and evenly fold each duck foot in half lengthwise. Make three cuts into the fold toward the back of the foot: one perpendicular to the fold, one diagonal and to the right of your first cut, and one diagonal and to the left of your first cut.\n\n\nWhen you unfold the feet, you should notice an asterisk shape on the duck's foot.\nEach cut should be about half the width of the widest part of your foot or ankle. You need the opening of each duck foot to fit over your real foot, but you do not want the cut to be so large that it slips off your foot or wrecks the felt.\n Stick one side of a Velcro strip to the bottom of the duck foot, somewhere near the middle. Apply the corresponding strip of Velcro to an orange sock you plan on wearing with the costume, positioning it where the other piece of Velcro will fall out.\n\n\nWhen choosing socks for your costume, look for socks that are a size larger than usual or otherwise a little loose. These socks will need to be able to fit over your shoes.\nThis step completes your duck feet. Set them aside as you work on the rest of your costume.\n Bunch up the poly-fil until you can gather a thick cylinder's worth that is about as wide as your waist (or the waist of the intended wearer).\n\n\nThe polyfill is not strictly necessary, but adding it will produce a plumper, more rounded duck costume, so it is strongly recommended.\n Turn a white sweatshirt inside out and place the cylinder of polyfill along the inside back of the shirt. Tape the stuffing in place with masking tape.\n\n\nNote that the white sweatshirt you use should be long enough to cover your rear. The stuffing will be added to the stretch of sweatshirt between the bottom of the shirt and the waistline of your pants.\nYou might find it helpful to try the sweatshirt on after you add the filling to see how it looks. Remove or add more filling as necessary to get a smooth yet plump look you can deal with.\n Trace three skinny almond shapes onto white felt, each one measuring roughly 12 inches (30.5 cm) long and 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide at the thickest point.\n\n\nTape or glue the top 3 inches (7.6 cm) of each tail feather to the inside of the center back of your sweatshirt. Each feather should connect at the same point on the sweatshirt yet fan out in different directions from underneath the sweatshirt bottom.\n You will need a separate rectangle of 21 by 8 inch (53.3 by 20.3 cm) white felt for each wing.\n\n\nTo make a wing:\n\nFold the rectangle in half, shortening it from 21 inches (53.3 cm) to 10.5 inches (26.7 cm).\nTrace a simple three or four feathered wing shape onto the felt. The ends of the feathers should point away from the folded part of the felt.\nCut the shape out. Leave the folded edge uncut.\nGlue or tape the tips of the wings together, but leave enough room on the inside of the wing, near the fold, to slip the sweatshirt sleeve through.\n\n\nRepeat for the second wing.\n Slip the sweatshirt on temporarily. Slide the wings through your sweatshirt arms so that the feathers point down when you hold your arms out. Tape or glue in place.\n Place the boa over one arm and cut off enough to extend from the shoulder to the tip of the sleeve. Place the rest of the boa over the other arm and repeat, giving yourself another arm's length of feathers.\n\n\nUse a hot glue gun or a needle and thread to attach the feather boa strips to each arm of the sweatshirt. Make sure that the feathers will be positioned on the top of the sleeves, rather than on the bottom or along the sides.\n Cut off the appropriate length with sharp scissors.\n\n\nAs with the sleeves, use hot glue or a needle and thread to attach these feathers to the front of the sweatshirt chest.\n If you still have feathers left from the boa, you can glue up to 5 inches (12.7 cm) of boa to the top crown of your duck cap.\n Slip the sweatshirt on, being careful to avoid knocking off any of the felt or feathers.\n\n\nIf the sweatshirt feels uncomfortable, you could wear a separate shirt beneath it. Make sure that the under-shirt cannot be seen once you put the sweatshirt on. If it can be seen, choose a shirt that matches the color of your costume's body: white for the adult duck, yellow for the duckling.\n Most duck and duckling legs are orange, so to mimic the appearance of duck legs, you will need to wear orange leggings.\n\n\nIf you are uncomfortable with actual leggings, use orange sweatpants or orange yoga pants. You could also use orange dye to color an old pair of white jeans or other lightly colored structured pants.\n Slip your shoes on. Place your orange Velcro socks over the shoes, and slide the orange duck feet over the socks and above your foot. Fix the duck feet in place by pressing the Velcro squares onto the Velcro of your socks.\n Place the duck cap on your head. Adjust as necessary to make it feel comfortable.\n Take a look in the mirror and straighten out any aspect of the costume that seems off-balance. Once you finish, your duck costume is complete and ready to show off.\n\n"}

Be respectful of your aunt/uncle's beliefs and personality. It is also important never to argue rudely with them. Show acceptance of their opinions by not rebelling. If you disagree, say your opinion and listen calmly to their viewpoints. No need to yell or scream; it doesn't do good to any of you.;\n, If you have cousins younger than yourself, try to bond with them by offering to babysit them, teach them, advise them or by playing with them. If you have older cousins, be respectful and honor their philosophy and way of life. Ask for guidance and appreciate all that they do for you. If they tell you to do something, be obedient unless it is immoral, unlawful or harmful to yourself.\n If they are incapable of doing something themselves, offer to help. For example, walk their dogs, run errands, fix small things around the house. If they are ill, make some vegetable soup and offer it to them. Traditionally, it is a very good deed to bring tea or coffee to one's loved elders every morning and ask if they need anything every night. Try doing this with sincerity, and do not stop unless you feel like it is a terribly dreaded part of your life.\n Whenever you visit your uncle/aunt take something for them. Homemade or baked items are a good idea. If you aren't yet able to make things yourself, a hug or a warm compliment are great things to give. Otherwise, be thoughtful. Think of what they like and bring to them. For instance, if your aunt loves jewelry, bring her a pearl necklace and say, \"For the shining pearl in your soul.\"\n\n, If your aunt/uncle are religious and share a religion with you, go to your holy site with them and worship reverently. If they don't share a religion with you, visit their worship sites and see some of the rituals, and have them do the same for yours. If they are not religious, take them to tours, seeing different buildings where people worship.\n If your aunt/uncle has a pet, be friendly with it, even if you don't like it. If they like something that you hate, accept their likes but don't force yourself to take them up. Cherish any shared hobbies and enjoy them together. Meanwhile, be obedient and follow the rules of the family. If you feel the rules are unjust, try to get them changed in an orderly manner rather than disobey them rebelliously.\n Do random acts of kindness. Try not to forget a holiday or birthday. If you do, then make it up with a kindly gift and an affectionate smile. Never lie to your aunt/uncle, and be as kind and respectful as possible.\n Be thankful for the moments you have together. Watching old films or photo collections, playing golf, swimming in the sea, reading together...whatever it is, if you and your aunt and uncle like it, cherish each moment.\n"}

Choose your graduation announcements and order them as soon as you are able. Once you get the announcements home, start a list of people you want to invite to the ceremony. Gather the addresses you need for mailing and start sending the announcements out.\n\n\nFind out if your school has limited seating or restrictions about how many people you can invite. Adhere to any guidelines.It\u2019s best to send your invites out as early as possible, so that people can mark their calendars for the event.\nIf you\u2019re tight on money, consider sending e-invitations. This will cost you significantly less and, in some cases, may even be free.\n Make it a point to visit the people who\u2019ve positively contributed to your experience as a student. Thank them for it and let them know what it means to you. If you want to keep in touch, gather phone numbers and email addresses.\n\n\nThis is also a great opportunity to line up recommendations and references for the future.\nWhatever your next step is, whether that\u2019s going on to further education or entering the workforce, you will need quality letters of recommendation and/or references.\n This is a great opportunity to reflect on your time as a student there. Recall the good memories you\u2019ve experienced in these places and fix them in your mind.\n\n\nIn a few weeks you will have moved on to the next phase of your life. You may not have the chance to visit these places ever again and you don\u2019t want to forget them.\n\n"}

You may also choose to wipe off the seat, too. Your child will place their hands on the handle, and those hands will automatically go in their mouths. Whatever germs are on the handle will be transferred to your child.Many supermarkets provide disinfectant wipes for you to use. If not, carry your own in your purse or baby bag.\nStudies have found that bacteria, including E. Coli and salmonella, can live on shopping cart handles.\n If you want to add extra protection for your child, consider placing something over the handle. This may be a blanket or specific cart seat covering that acts as a barrier between your child and the handle. Seat covers also cover the edges of the cart, which also have germs.This can help keep your child\u2019s hands away from the handle. It also helps reduce the risk that your child will place their mouth on the handle.\n After you take your child out of the shopping cart seat, wash their hands. This helps remove any germs they may have picked up from touching the cart. If you are unable to wash their hands immediately, use hand sanitizer or wipes on their hands before driving away."}

You need to ask probing questions and listen carefully to the responses. Some ways to ask questions and respond include:\n\n\n\"So, your mom tells me your are failing math (or whatever subject/s), how badly are you failing?\"\n\"Tell me the reasons you think you are failing. It's okay if you think you are the reason - just tell me what you are doing to fail and we can work on that together.\"\n\"You are probably not stupid. You may learn in different ways but I find that students are rarely stupid really. We will work to find the ways you learn best. How do you think you learn best?\";\n, The goal of the first session is to find out what the student needs to work on and learn but more importantly to let the student know that you are his/her support. He or she does not have to bear the entire burden alone anymore. You are here as an expert to direct the process so that he or she can work his/her way out of this failing predicament. This will immediately give confidence to the student. The first session involves a lot of important psychological work that you will build on.\n\n\nWays to assess the student include through examination, or perhaps by doing a quick interview with the parents of the child or a look at their previous results.\n For example, a child is doing maths, and is fabulous at algebra, but has trouble remembering his or her timetables. Make sure you nail the timetables into their system; many a source of failure can be pinpointed on a failure to grasp a key underpinning at some point during the studies.\n\n\nSet goals that focus on the gaps. Then proceed to goals that focus on the future.\n Then make sure the student can do it on their own before leaving. Give the student positive verbal commendation of their good work in this session and thank them for being honest with you.\n The goal of the second and remaining tutorial sessions is to make sure the student is progressing in a positive direction by doing homework, making better grades on tests, and feeling more in control of the subject. Every student will be different as to how much autonomy they have over their life and schoolwork. You have to work with them according to their developmental pace\u2013\u2013not yours. Otherwise they will improve to please you not to help themselves. This is very sensitive work and you must keep giving the ownership of the work to them. You are only there to support and help them do the work. Modeling is always appropriate when they forget or a new concept is taught, just make sure they need it. Always be honest and expect them to be honest with you about everything. You will find the relationship very rewarding.\n Extend the student and create an expectation for the student to start doing this for him- or herself. The sooner this is internalized, the better able the student will become at self-disciplining the learning process and doing well.\n Prepare revision points to help go back over materials already covered. Do an end of term exam to see whether there has been any improvement.\n What to charge? You have to check around your community to see what other tutors charge and then consider your qualifications.\n Keep a copy of the expected goals.\n\n"}

The longer you wait, the more you open the door for potential confusion or run the risk of your other employees disclosing your disability for you. Get ahead of this by telling your employee as soon as possible.Tell them on their first day of work when you begin meeting with them to assign them tasks and acclimate them to the office.\nThey may have already noticed or picked up on it anyway, but telling them will ensure that they are not confused or left wondering.\nTell them in private. Though you may be comfortable with your impairment, this may be new for them. Allow them time to process away from others.;\n, Though talking about your disability may be a sore spot for you, try to be as at ease as possible with your employee. It is your job to make sure that they feel as comfortable as possible in this working environment and having an awkward conversation with you will not aid in that.Take a few breaths beforehand. Review and rehearse what you will say. Stick to the facts and answer any questions they might have.\n When speaking about your impairment, avoid injecting emotion into the discussion. Speak to them as factually and practically as possible. Describe the nature of your impairment and the impact that it has.For instance you might say \u201cThough I am not legally blind, my vision is severely impaired. I am able to discern light and dark as well as colors, but I do have to do all of my readings via braille or electronics.\u201d\n\n, During this conversation, it is important that you inform your employee of any accommodations that you might need them to abide by. For instance, perhaps you need them to send you any information prior to meetings electronically rather than giving you a hard copy.You might need other accommodations like larger print.\n In addition to certain professional needs, don\u2019t forget the other niceties that make or break an office. Ask them to be mindful of your disability in returning items to their proper places so that you don\u2019t have difficulty locating them. Remind them to never leave items in walkways. Think of any other requests that you could make to this employee to ensure that you can do your job without limitations or difficulties.\n\n\nYou might say something like \u201cIt\u2019s really important for me that all office supplies stay in the same location. So if you use the stapler in the back, just be sure to put it back exactly where you found it.\u201d\n\n, Though your disability is certainly a part of who you are, it does not define you exclusively. You might want to discuss the ways that it has helped you so that they can understand the strengths of it.For instance, perhaps you have noticed that you are more detail oriented because of it or more knowledgeable about technology.\nPerhaps your office has a culture of inclusion and acceptance.\n After you have spoken to your employee about your visual impairment, now is the time to see what questions they might have. It is likely that they have not had a boss before who this disability, but bear with them. Allow them to learn more about you by asking questions.\n\n\nEncourage your employee to be open with you. They may feel uncomfortable asking you questions about your visual impairment. If they do ask you questions, be honest so that they are not afraid to approach you with questions in the future.\nTell them that even if they don\u2019t have questions now, they can ask you later in person or via email.\nRemind them that you are there for them and want to develop them professionally.\n Many companies offer workshops to employees on working with those from backgrounds different from them. Others offer workshops on how to be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Inform your new employees about any such trainings and tell them that they can attend if they would like so that they can learn more.Do not make this required.

Digital production will require a suitable computer and a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), minimum.\n\n\nWhen building or buying a computer, choose one with a 3.0 dual core processor (or better), at least 8 GB of RAM, and no less than 500 GB of hard drive space.Popular DAWs, which are excellent tools for home or independent production, include Ableton Live, Fruity Loops (FL) Studio, Steinberg Cubase Pro, and Apple Logic Pro.Feel free to use whatever writing utensil you desire for physical production. However, as the song develops, you'll likely have to make adjustments or changes, so pencil is recommended.\n Tap into universal themes and emotions so anyone can connect with your song. Heartache is a common topic in hit music, but there are many other options, like falling in love, the feeling of a perfect day, betrayal, loss, and hope.The theme of your song will guide you in the production of its lyrics and sound. These should align with the feelings and use words associated with your theme.\n Timeless lyrics will still be enjoyed even after a considerable time has passed. These kinds of lyrics also generally have a wide audience, which will improve your overall popularity with many different age groups.\n\n\nIf your lyrics aren't catchy, you'll never be recognized as a hit songwriter. Look for lyrical inspiration in poetry, art (like exhibits at museums), and the natural world.Some example of timeless hits from the 60s through the 70s include \"Paint it Black\" by The Rolling Stones, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" by Van Morrison, \"Go Your Own Way\" by Fleetwood Mac.\nTimeless hits from the 80s through the 2000s include \"Don't Stop me Now\" by Queen, \"Don't Stop Believin' \" by Journey, \"Billy Jean\" by Michael Jackson, \"Smells like Teen Spirit,\" by Nirvana, and \"Mr. Brightside\" by the Killers., Alternatively, you can do this in your DAW if you've decided to produce your song digitally. By splitting your lyrics into syllables, you can be certain that each syllable gets a tone.\n\n\nGenerally, each syllable of the lyrics will be assigned a tone (also called a \"note\"). In some situations, a single tone may be sustained for a few syllables or split into a run of tones, like sixteenth notes, for a single syllable.\nEven when you plan on sustaining a single tone for many syllables or beats, breaking up the lyrics into syllables will help you keep track of the rhythm of the song.\n Tempo is a musical term that refers to the speed of the song. This is usually recorded in BPM (beats per minute). You can set the tempo with a metronome, though most DAWs come built in with this tempo keeping tool.Although a hit can be nearly any tempo, most use one that is between 117 to 122 BPM. You may want to use this trend in to your advantage when writing your hit song.\nDo some research on the genre or kind of music you want to produce. Some kinds of songs have specific speed requirements, like the usual 90 BPM of ballads., The bassline is comprised of lower-tones and percussion, like drums and cymbals. This part of the song is generally simple and repetitive, but catchy. It should follow along with the pulse of your tempo.Although percussion instruments tend to dominate the bassline, low-tone single notes, chords, and runs of notes can be added in with other instruments. Try doing this with a piano, guitar, or baritone.\nThe bassline of your song should loop so that it plays through most of your song. This pattern may be adjusted at transitions, like where the verse switches to the chorus, solos, or at a musical bridge towards the end of the song., The melody is the main through-line of the song. When you hum along with the main part of a song, you're humming the melody. In most cases, the melody is made up of a single instrument, a single voice, or a single instrument paired with a voice.The melody of your song should complement and synchronize with the beat of the metronome and the bassline.\nInstruments frequently used for the melody include the piano, guitar, brass (like the trumpet or trombone), organs, synth tones, and more.\nDesign your melody so it has contour. The natural rise and fall of tone throughout the melody, along with dynamic (volume) changes will make your melody more interesting to listeners., Be sparing when adding more instruments to your song. On average, most hit songs have no more than seven instruments (including voices).Too many instruments/voices can make your song distorted and unclear.\n\n\nIf you're a novice songwriter, you may want to keep the number of accompanying music instruments (including voices) added at this point to two or three to prevent oversaturation and muddiness.\n\nHarmonize the accompanying instruments in chords. Use pleasing sounding arrangements of single-tone notes or runs of notes in the accompaniment., Although songs written in minor keys can be compelling, few rise to the top as hits.Chord structure that is too complicated can overwhelm listeners. Stick to simple, archetypal patterns that contribute to the atmosphere of the song.One common chord progression in hit songs is I \u2013 V \u2013 VIm \u2013 IV, as in: C \u2013 G \u2013 Am \u2013 F\u00a0; D \u2013 A \u2013 Bm \u2013 G\u00a0; A \u2013 E \u2013 F#m \u2013 D\u00a0; G \u2013 D \u2013 Em \u2013 C\u00a0; and E \u2013 B \u2013 C#m \u2013 A.\nThere are many different chords to choose from and unique ways of putting chords together. Experiment with these to find what works best with your song.\n When you reach the end of a build or powerful lyrics, increase or decrease the dynamics (volume) correspondingly. Use an extra instrument or two to emphasize these parts of your song. Use rests (pauses) to increase tension.Unusual sounds or samples can create an enjoyable surprise in your song. DJ Premier did this artfully by bringing out the drumline with a sample of birds chirping., Even though many trends in hit music have been analyzed, no composer or researcher has figured out how to write a hit every time. Strong feelings usually convey potent messages to listeners, so using your feelings as a guide for writing your hit can be helpful.Save drafts before making changes to your song. Some additions can make a song worse, in which case you might want to roll back the song to a previous version.\n Re-purpose themes, licks, and riffs from old music. Put your own spin on these and incorporate them into your own melody. Take inspiration from your favorite oldies or the classics. Revitalize forgotten hits of the past by creating your own song from them.Avoid copying a song note for note, word for word, or even too closely. Doing so could be interpreted as plagiarism and could result in legal trouble.Explore different avenues of inspiration. You may find that collaborating with another artist pushes you to make your best work.\n Trying to follow the rules too rigidly can stifle your creativity. It can also make your sound too stiff or lacking in fluidity. When brainstorming ideas for your song, be willing to try new things. You never know when an unexpected lyric or combination of sounds will occur to you.Because music can be fickle, you might want to keep a physical notebook for ideas or take musical memos on your phone for ideas that pop into your head.\n When mining for gold, it can take quite a while before finding the motherload. In the same way, even talented songwriters write many songs before they strike upon a hit.Train your song writing abilities by practicing writing songs as frequently as possible.\n\n"}

In England, for instance, a man rescued his elderly neighbor from a robbery by listening through the wall with a glass.In his situation, spying was definitely justified.\nThings are rarely so clear cut, however. You should probably not act if you have any doubts about the situation. If you decide to go ahead, make sure that you know the possible consequences of your actions.\n Eavesdropping means to overhear, record, magnify, or transmit any part of a private conversation without the consent of at least one person involved. Be aware that states have laws against eavesdropping. By spying you may well be breaking the law; you might even be violating the law by possessing a device for spying.Your state may have a \u201cone party consent\u201d or \u201ctwo party consent\u201d law. One party consent means that it is illegal to eavesdrop unless you have the consent of at least one of the people engaged in a private conversation. In two party consent you must have permission from both parties to listen, record, or amplify their communication.Take the state of Michigan. Michigan has a two party consent law \u2013 you must have permission from all parties in order to \u201coverhear, record, amplify, or transmit any part of a private discourse.\u201d This applies even in your own home. Eavesdropping there is also a felony., What happens if you eavesdrop and someone finds out? What could happen to you? This is a good question and you should consider all of the possible outcomes, which in many cases are severe.\n\n\nIn Michigan, the penalties for illegal eavesdropping are up to 2 years in prison, up to $2,000 in fines, or both.In California, eavesdropping is either a misdemeanor or felony. As a misdemeanor you face up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine; as a felony, you could spend up to three years in prison and a $2,500 fine.Of course, a criminal penalty is not the only bad outcome. You also open yourself to a civil lawsuit for violating someone\u2019s privacy, which could be costly and run into the thousands of dollars.

Therefore, it is important to monitor what they eat. You can best do this by examining their collection of Halloween treats at the end of the night. Look at the back of each snack for a small printed section that lists all the ingredients. Identify snacks that they can and cannot eat.If there is no ingredients label on the food, consider it unsafe for your child.Be wary of cross-contamination as well. Check the labels for information about the facility that the treat was produced in to determine if it is safe for your child to eat.\n As you\u2019re reading the labels, separate the candy into two large bowls or baskets. One bowl can hold candies and snacks your child cannot eat. The other bowl or basket should hold the remaining snacks and treats (the ones that are safe for your child to consume), With your child\u2019s Halloween snacks divided into two bowls, hold onto the bowl with snacks your child is allergic to. Do not allow your child to consume these treats. Return the other treats to your child and encourage them to consume a few in moderate amounts.Too many sweet goods can give your child a stomach ache and contribute to poor dental health. Limit their candy intake.\n Depending on your child\u2019s food allergy, it\u2019s possible that most of the candy your child receives will be inedible due to their condition. To prevent your child from being disappointed about being unable to enjoy their candy collection, obtain candies that your child is not allergic to and trade them to your child in exchange for the candies and treats they are allergic to. Alternatively, offer your child the opportunity to trade their candy in for several small toys (or one big toy).You could also invite your child\u2019s peers to the candy trade to allow your child access to other allergen-free treats and sweets. Even kids who don\u2019t have food allergies might enjoy the opportunity to trade candies they dislike for others they prefer.\nThe size and cost of the toy you provide your child in exchange for the candy is up to you.

If it is close or below the minimum line, you should inspect the master cylinder and clutch system for leaks.If the brake fluid is well below the minimum line, there may be a leak somewhere in the system.\nLeaks not only allow brake fluid to escape, but allow pockets of air to enter which can cause further issue when operating your clutch.\n Most vehicles use one of three common types of brakes fluid. It is extremely important that you purchase the correct type of brake fluid for your clutch master cylinder to avoid doing damage to the system or preventing the clutch from engaging. Refer to your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual to identify what the specific type of brake fluid you need for your vehicle.Most vehicle\u2019s require SAE J1703, US FMVSS or 116 DOT 3 brake fluid in the clutch master cylinder.\nIf you do not have a copy of the owner\u2019s manual for your vehicle, look for the information you need on the automaker\u2019s website.\n Poke a hole in the seal on the mouth of the brake fluid, then tear a larger hole on the opposite side. This will allow the brake fluid to pour from the container in a controlled and easily directed fashion. Open the reservoir attached to the clutch master cylinder and pour brake fluid in until it reaches the \u201cfull\u201d line.You can tear the seal off of the brake fluid container completely, but it will make it harder to direct your pour without spilling any.\nBe careful not to overfill the reservoir as it may cause the clutch to not function properly.\n Be aware of any dirt or debris that may fall into the clutch master cylinder while it\u2019s open. Even a small amount of sediment can create significant problems for the clutch system. Blocked lines can prevent the clutch from engaging or create a buildup in pressure that can result in leaks.If anything falls into the brake fluid in the open master cylinder, try to scoop the debris out or dab at it with a dry cloth.\nKeep the lid on the clutch master cylinder reservoir at all times when not filling it.\n Once the reservoir if full of brake fluid, inspect the lid for signs of damage before screwing it back on. If the threads on the lid are crossed or damaged, it may prevent a seal from occurring. A failed seal will allow air to enter the clutch lines, which will cause issues with the function of the clutch.If the lid is damaged, place it back on the reservoir and do not drive the vehicle until you purchase a replacement.\nReplacement lids can be found at your local auto parts store.\n Press and depress the clutch pedal with the vehicle running. Feel for inconsistency in the pressure required to do so. Varying levels of pressure are a good indicator that there are pockets of air in the clutch system. If there are any air pockets in the system, you will need to bleed the clutch to remove them.Pockets of air can cause the clutch to not engage or disengage properly.\nAir in the clutch lines can be a symptom of a leak, so be sure to check carefully for one.\n The clutch master cylinder should be dry and free of sticky grime or sludge. If it is covered in grime, clean it off with a rag and some brake cleaner to make it easier to identify signs of a leak. If the brake fluid in the reservoir was very low before filling it, there may be a leak.Once you\u2019ve cleaned the master cylinder, start the vehicle and have a friend press the clutch a few times.\nLook for signs of bubbles or fluid leaking from the master cylinder.\nCheck the reservoir and master cylinder again after a few days to ensure there are no leaks.\n If you did not identify any signs of leaking on the master cylinder or the cap for the reservoir, follow the lines leaving the master cylinder all the way to the slave cylinder. Check the lines and slave cylinder for signs of leaking or bubbling fluid.If you locate a leak, you should have it repaired immediately.\nAfter sealing a leak, you will need to bleed the clutch system.\n Put the vehicle in first gear and depress the clutch pedal as you apply gas to begin moving forward. Press the clutch again and shift into second gear. If there are any issues with getting the vehicle into our out of gear, it could be a result of the clutch failing to engage and disengage. If you have difficulty getting the transmission into gear, take the vehicle to a service professional to be diagnosed.A failed clutch will not allow you to put the vehicle in gear at all.\nSlight grinding between gears may be due to clutch pressure issues, but may also be caused by failing synchros within the transmission.\n\n"}

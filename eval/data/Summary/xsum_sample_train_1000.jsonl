Felipe Massa, another local boy, followed suit.\nThe fans know the glory days have long gone, that a Brazilian victory is as unlikely as a day without a traffic jam in one of the world's most crowded cities.\nBut still they come, packing the grandstands and singing and chanting from early in the day.\nWhat draws them there? A deep-seated passion for the sport, for one. The almost-certainty of a great sporting spectacle, for another.\nInterlagos has a knack for producing exciting races. Drama is synonymous with the track, not least because of its position at the business end of the season.\nIt is a claustrophobic place. The circuit winds around a natural amphitheatre, high on a hill, the sprawl of Sao Paulo both a backdrop and crushing in from all sides. The heavy humidity, and almost-permanent threat of rain, add to the atmosphere.\nIt feels locked in, and not just because of the cramped old paddock, a fraction of the size of anything Bernie Ecclestone finds acceptable these days.\nThe track is a splash of vibrant green in an ocean of concrete grey and smog brown; the city butting up against the perimeter fence, endless tower blocks filling the skyline.\nTwenty years ago, a favela sprawled up the hill all the way to the perimeter wall. There has been an attempt to spruce things up a bit, the old corrugated-roof shacks replaced by flats closest to the circuit, houses of naked breeze blocks a bit further down the road. But down at heel, to say the least, it remains.\nThere is an unmistakable edge. The road up to Interlagos is not a place for a stranger to linger.\nInside, the track feels like a haven. One of the shortest laps on the calendar somehow packs in a long straight - superb for overtaking - and a challenging sequence of long corners, the best the uphill double right-hander of Ferra Dura/Laranha and the fast downhill left of Mergulho. It's a great race track, with emphasis on the \"race\".\nThey are corners with a history - the new track is about half of the old one. Part of a previous era, it was a magnificent five miles of twists and turns, uphill and down, which started with two incredible, banked, high-speed left-handers, taken absolutely flat out by some, still visible outside the modern Turns One, Two and Three.\nIt all adds to the character of the place. Loud, intimidating, crazy, invigorating, rough-around-the-edges.

They have been likened to the caps on the ends of shoelaces - they stop things from unravelling.\nOver time they wear down - and when they do, the DNA they protect is compromised and the cell can malfunction or die.\nThis is where the zebra finches came in: how early and accurately could longer telomeres predict a longer life?\nTo find out, the Glasgow researchers collaborated with colleagues at Exeter University, with Glasgow's Prof Pat Monaghan leading the team.\nTiny blood samples were taken from a group of 99 zebra finches and the lengths of their telomeres measured. They were tested again throughout their lifetimes.\nTo find out how long the birds lived, the researchers had to wait until they died.  The first turned up its claws in just over six months.

Locking up low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options is not effective, because they go to jail, they come out, they get involved with drugs again, and they go right back to it.\n\"I have nothing but praise for the law enforcement agents I've worked with [but] so many of them have said to me 'we're fighting a war that can't be won the way we're fighting it'.\n\"The war itself is at a draw. And I believe that draw will be maintained indefinitely unless there's a dramatic change in our approach to drugs and drug trafficking.\"\nFormer Colombian President Cesar Gaviria worked on the Global Commission on Drug Policy report in 2011 which called on states to decriminalise drugs.\n\"Our recommendation is regulation for everything. That's what Portugal did.\n\"If you look at the last 50 years, what has been done? In the US, 600,000 people in jail, $40bn (\u00c2\u00a327bn) of spending a year. The highest rates of consumption of the whole world. You have to say that it doesn't work. It's a failed policy, and public opinion knows that.\n\"Ten years ago it was unthinkable that the US would move massively to the legalisation of cannabis.\n\"That taboo has been broken. In the US, a majority of people are talking about approving legalisation of marijuana.\"\nHe cites the example of Uruguay, the first country to legalise the marijuana trade.\n\"All Latin America's looking at Uruguay. It's a country that also looks how to deal with the production, with the supply of the marijuana that is in the state hands.\n\"I don't expect any major set back of the policy that the Uruguayans have put in place.\n\"From the beginning in 1961, the objective of the UN Conventions has been to live in a world free of drugs, but it's a utopia.  It's something unreachable.  It's not to recognise human nature.\"\nFormer chief scientist in the White House Office of National Drug Policy Control David Murray insists the billions of dollars spent tackling drug traffickers and destroying coca crops were well spent:\n\"A 75% reduction in the productive capacity of Colombian cocaine was achieved by strategic initiatives of supply reduction in partnership with the leadership and political will of the Colombians themselves.\n\"That's been a sustained achievement that then resulted in a more than 45% drop in the prevalence rate of cocaine use in the United States on the streets\n\"This is a global business. As a global business they have their preferred mode of operation where they would like to be with regard to supply routes - ungoverned safe havens where they would like to be to carry out their business with maximum efficiency.\n\"When you push them off of that spot they will adapt but they are diminished.\n\"We may have an idealised world where prevention and treatment and recovery happen in a certain way and we don't have to do the hard and dirty work, but that's not the reality on the ground.\n\"The reality is it's a tough slog, it is a cancer and it is worth fighting. Sure it's discouraging to see drug use continue but it actually is diminished if you take a long perspective over time and we actually are making progress with regard to it.\"\nProfessor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland has been a leading academic in the field of drugs policy for decades.\n\"The war on drugs was partly defined by its rhetoric.\n\"The need for national leaders to stand up and talk about the scourge of drugs, and signal to the population that [being tough on drugs] was a priority was an important part of the war itself.\n\"There's going to be less and less of that. I think there's going to be a change both in tone and substance, so the 'war on drugs' will become a less and less plausible metaphor for describing policy. I think it's going to be a public health rhetoric for the foreseeable future.\n\"I do believe that we have in a sense had an experiment with trying to be very aggressive about controlling drugs through use of prohibition.  And we have a sense that that did not work well. And so we're now trying to find better ways of managing the problem, and I think that's welcome.\n\"If you look at the number of people who are in prison for drug offences, at least in the US, that's an important indicator of the change in real policy, and those numbers are starting to go down.  Not dramatically, but they are definitely going down, and many states are making changes that are likely to accelerate that decline.\"\nAs drug laws soften he argues the question of regulation becomes key, as happened when gambling was legalised:\n\"Lottery play was always seen as a bad thing, you legalised it because you wanted to take money away from organised crime, but the result was that the state lotteries became the most aggressive promoters.\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service, Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT\nListen to the programme\nDownload the programme\n\"You have slogans like 'Why be a mug and work when you can play the lottery and win easily?', just the kind of slogan you'd associate with the worst commercial promotion, but done by the state.\n\"Alcohol is still heavily promoted, and it's promoted in states that have state liquor monopolies, and we've only recently really been able to restrict smoking promotions.\n\"So I think there's considerable risk that even if there was a monopoly there would be promotion of marijuana, and clearly what we see in the state of Colorado where it is commercially available, it's regulated, like alcohol, what we see is very aggressive promotion, advertising.\n\"You cannot with a straight face say that marijuana legalisation won't lead to more marijuana dependence.\n\"Choose your problem. There is no solution. Use of psychoactive drugs is a social problem like a whole lot of other social problems. We manage it.

Fitzel has overseen improved fortunes at all levels of the game after the country missed on qualification for the 2010 World Cup.\nSince then, the Czech Republic were quarter-finalists in the 2012 European Championships and finished top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group.\n\"If we did not have a 16-team league and we only had 12, only a few youth players would get a chance,\" Fitzel told BBC Scotland.\n\"The bigger the league, the more teams are playing at a higher level, and the more young players are getting a chance. The more they play, the more they improve through experience of playing in the top league.\"\nFrom next season, the Czech First League will be ranked nine places above Scotland in the Uefa coefficient rankings, with two teams qualifying for the Champions League qualifiers.\nHowever, Fitzel admits a 16-team league does have its pitfalls and they could end up moving in the opposite direction.\n\"Currently here in the Czech Republic we are discussing maybe having 10 or 12 teams playing each other four times,\" Fitzel said. \"At the moment we do not play enough games.\n\"A 16-team league has allowed us to have a winter break of two-and-a-half months.

That's fantastic income for the clubs and the stadiums hold 13,000 - 15,000 people.\"\nFitzel, like many in Europe, has looked on with interest at the Scottish game in the last few years.

This was where the Nazis installed four gas chambers and crematoria to speed up the murder and disposal of people, who were mostly Jews, from across Europe.\nAuschwitz-Birkenau, set up by the Germans in Nazi-occupied Poland, is largely intact and is now a museum.

But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable.\nI couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women.\nThese feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity.\nThey are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border.\nBut elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality.\nAl-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back.\nPerhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax.\nAt Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: \"Oh, I thought you were carrying guns.\"\nAnd yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon.\nFor two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy.\nBut Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya.\nThen, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast.\nTroops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with \"friendly\" warlords.\nSince then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya.\nRevenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere.\nThen there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation.\nIt has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast.\nAnd then there is Greater Somalia.\nIt is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa.\nAl-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges.\nBy attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area.\nNot that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite.\nYes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town.\nSurely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support.\nBut overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.", "summary": "\"Now I'm okay,\" was about all Cynthia Terotich could manage, as she sat in the casualty ward in Garissa's hospital."}

{"id": "35659152", "article": "Cryptography was once controlled by the state and deployed only for military and diplomatic ends. But in the 1970s, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised a system which took encryption keys away from the state and marked the start of the so-called \"Crypto Wars\".\nWhitfield Diffie and three other experts spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the tensions at the heart of the spat between Apple and the FBI.\nIn 1975, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised \"public key cryptography\", which revolutionised encryption.\n\"The basic techniques we used until public key cryptography come from around 1500 in the western world, and were known from about 800 in the Middle East.\n\"They are basically arithmetic. Not ordinary integer arithmetic, but something like clock arithmetic - it's 11 o'clock and you wait three hours and you get 2 o'clock - and table lookups. What's the 5th element in the table? What's the 20th element?\n\"The trouble is you can't do them very well without some kind of mechanical computation. A human being can't do enough of those calculations to produce a secure system without making too many mistakes.\n\"Before what we did, you could not have supported cryptography outside a fairly integrated organisation. If you look at the US Department of Defense, it's very large, but very centralised; everybody knows the chain of command.\n\"They can have a trusted entity run by the National Security Agency (NSA) to manage the keys [used by the military and government]. If you were in the military, and it was part of your assignment to talk to somebody securely in another part of the military, they would supply you with a key, and every morning you come out and put one in your teletype machine or phone or whatever.\n\"But the internet is not just meant for friends to talk to friends, it's for everybody to talk to everybody. Until you have public key cryptography you have no way of arranging the keys on demand at a moment's notice for these secure communications.\n\"That's what browsers do with websites all the time. Amazon, eBay, all of the merchants on the internet encrypt at least some of the traffic you have with them, at the very least the payment portion of it.\n\"[At the time] the NSA reacted like any other enterprise that has had a monopoly in a market for a long period of time. Suddenly somebody was treading on its turf, and it made several attempts to recapture its market.\"\nSusan Landau is professor of Cyber Security Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.\n\"Public-key cryptography was mathematically elegant and also quite elementary. That's what made it so powerful and so wonderful.\n\"The NSA said 'Wait a minute: this work should be classified.' They had been accustomed to being the only place that cryptography was done. They didn't want a competitor developing algorithms that maybe they would have trouble breaking into. They wanted to hold the keys to the kingdom.\n\"There was a big fight between the academic and industry research community and the NSA. But it was settled fairly amicably, fairly quickly. The next problem was who would control the development of cryptography standards for the US government.\n\"The NSA does this for military and diplomatic communications, but there's a vast need for cryptography for civilian agencies such as health and human services, education, agriculture. The National Bureau of Standards had been doing this in the 1970s but in the 1980s the NSA began pushing in this direction.\n\"Congress, who had always looked more favourably on the civilian side, put the National Institute of Standards and Technology in charge.\n\"But the law also included this little thing about three people from NSA approving certain things. They exercised tremendous control, and kept blocking standards that were more friendly to the commercial sector. That battle went on between 1987 until the mid 1990s. It was quite ugly.\n\"Another battle was over the clipper chip. Clipper was a very hard algorithm with a secure key, but the key was split and was to be shared with agencies of the federal government. The idea was [that] a business person travelling overseas would be able to use a clipper-enabled phone and talk securely with the office back at home.\n\"But if you're doing something illegal the US government will be able to decrypt easily, because the keys are held by its agencies.\n\"It was a complete flop. Outside the US, no one wanted it. Inside the US, no one bought it. It was a total failure.\n\"The controls on cryptography in the 1990s were very odd because they were controls on an export. If you wanted to export a computer or communications device with cryptography, you needed an export licence from the US government.\n\"Much of the time you would get 'We're looking at it, we'll get back to you.' Of course, when you're selling high tech, you don't need a delay of two months, [so] you decide not to have strong encryption within the device - you put in something very weak that the US government will allow to go without a licence. The effect was to not have strong encryption domestically as well as abroad.\n\"In 2000, the US government loosened the controls on export of devices with strong encryption; it looked as if the private sector won the battle.\"\nAlan Woodward is an expert in signals intelligence, intelligence gathered from communications, who has worked for the UK government in various roles.\n\"Suppose you got intelligence that people appeared to be mobilising their military forces. You'd need to know whether that was a prelude to war, or just an exercise. One of the ways to do that was by analysing the signals and communications traffic going around on the other side.\n\"In the early 2000s, it got harder. Previously they'd had the ability to decrypt things that were weakly encrypted. You could throw a super computer at the problem and try all the possible keys until you unlock the message.\n\"You just physically couldn't do that for the number of encrypted messages that were starting to pile up. But also, the forms of encryption were becoming stronger. The encryption that was being used by governments themselves back in the 1970s was called the Data Encryption Standard. With a modern PC, you can break that in a matter of seconds. That kind of evolution in encryption and decryption has been going on ever since.\n\"It got worse because there were various other forms of technology that were based on encryption, where you were able to remain anonymous, completely hidden. There's a thing called the Tor network which causes security agencies a great deal of trouble, because you don't even know where that person is based, never mind who they're communicating with.\n\"Governments recognised that there wasn't a lot you could do about this technically or from a policy perspective. It's out there. So what you have to do is  be able to get at it before it is encrypted or after it's decrypted.\n\"They recognised that they needed to work more closely with the technology providers because they were the ones that owned the infrastructure that was being used.  They were the ones running it; it was no longer governments and state telecommunications companies.\n\"They had very good relationships. Microsoft produced a suite of software called Cofee (Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor), which is only given to government and Law Enforcement Agencies. It's a forensic tool that allows you to analyse Windows systems.\n\"You used to be able to go along to Apple and they could unlock the phone. With messaging services it was possible for governments with the right authorisation to go along and sit in the middle of the conversation and look at the messages in a non-encrypted form.\n\"All of that changed when Edward Snowden got his leaks out.\"\nJeff Larson is a reporter at New York investigative newsroom ProPublica. It worked with the Guardian newspaper on the sensitive material leaked by Edward Snowden from the US National Security Agency in 2013.\n\"I had seen something in the Snowden tranche of documents that made me suspicious that the NSA and GCHQ had been working behind the scenes to crack encryption that powers internet technologies.\n\"When you log into your bank or Twitter or Facebook, your web browser talks to those servers over what's known as TLS, which is an encryption layer that protects the confidentiality of that traffic.\n\"The intelligence agencies - not only NSA and GCHQ, but Canada and Australia and New Zealand- had spent 10 years and untold billions of dollars trying to break these fundamental encryption technologies.\n\"They honed things, like their power with super computers, but they were also able to mount a programme of inserting back doors into cryptographic software, and - perhaps a bit more troubling - the NSA launched a covert campaign to influence the very standards that programmers rely on to create encryption.\n\"So standards bodies write up 'here's how encryption works, here's how you implement it in your software', and the NSA was actually working against that effort.\n\"Ever since [the Snowden revelations were published in] 2013, there's been quite a movement to further encrypt the internet.\n\"I think there's been an awakening on the part of private companies that it is important to their users to keep [their data] confidential and secret.\n\"Apple saw these revelations about the overreach of intelligence services and law enforcement services, and created a phone that was harder to crack because they wanted to increase the security of their users. I do believe that.\n\"The Apple case is very hard. I see the arguments on both sides. I see the fact that the FBI wants access to this information, and I also see Apple's need to protect its customers' privacy.\n\"I hope that we come to a conclusion that is more open and transparent.

After the movement failed to win any concessions from Beijing, Ms Yau and Mr Leung became involved in a new political party - Youngspiration - that campaigns against mainland China's influence on Hong Kong, and advocates a \"Hong Kong first\" approach.\nThe party struck a nerve with many young Hong Kongers unhappy with China and disillusioned with traditional pro-democracy parties, who they argue have failed to achieve any reform.\nBut, after their election victory, things quickly spiralled out of control.\nMs Yau and Mr Leung sparked a furore when they were being sworn in last month.\nInstead of pledging allegiance to the \"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China\", the duo swore allegiance to the \"Hong Kong nation\", used a term considered derogatory towards China, and displayed a banner that read \"Hong Kong is not China\".\nTheir oaths were invalidated, and thousands of people protested against their actions, demanding they be removed from parliament.\nA top Chinese official even likened the duo to \"two cancer cells - if you don't care about it, it will continue to hurt your body\".\nThe Hong Kong government launched a court case to disqualify them. And the Chinese government also decided to intervene - issuing a controversial interpretation of Hong Kong's law on oath taking, to say that any oath that is not \"sincere\" should be automatically disqualified.\nAfter losing the court case, Ms Yau and Mr Leung were disqualified as legislators - and are now also bombarded with angry comments on social media, where people accuse them of being useless, politically na\u00c3\u00afve, or insulting their country.\nBut for all the controversy surrounding her, Ms Yau comes across as mild-mannered and determined in person - and less slick or media trained than many other politicians.\n\"We know that appealing the court decision will cost a lot,\" she says. \"We may face bankruptcy, but we have no choice.\"\nShe is concerned that if the case is not challenged, it may set a legal precedent for other pro-independence legislators to be disqualified, which would allow the government to \"negate the results of a democratic vote\".\nShe says she believes in independence for Hong Kong because the \"One Country, Two Systems\" model under which it is governed, after it was handed back to China from the British in 1997, is \"a failed experiment\".\nDespite the model, which promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, \"in these few years we have seen the PRC [People's Republic of China] government having direct interventions into the internal affairs of Hong Kong\".\n\"We have to find another way to solve this problem,\" she says. \"One solution may be independence - or maybe we can find another kind of solution, but right now I can't think of any other solutions.\"\nIt is true that there has been growing anger in Hong Kong at perceived Chinese involvement in its affairs.\nIn particular, the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers who published books critical of mainland China in late 2015 sparked concerns over Hong Kong's future.\nBut a majority of people in Hong Kong do not support independence - or think that calls for independence are part of the problem, not the solution.\nHong Kong relies on China for much of its food and water supplies - as well as much of its trade - and the Chinese government has shown that it has zero tolerance for moves towards independence from any of its territories.\nThe last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, supported democratic reform in Hong Kong - but recently said that independence for Hong Kong is \"something which is not going to happen\".\nHe has argued that the campaign for independence \"dilutes support for democracy and makes a mockery of a serious political argument\", and that it would be \"a tragedy\" if the \"moral high ground\" of those seeking democracy was lost.\nVeteran democracy activist Martin Lee has even said he felt suspicious of Ms Yau and Mr Leung's actions, saying that they are \"giving [Beijing] the excuse\" to destroy Hong Kong's judicial independence.\nSome have even accused Ms Yau and Mr Leung of secretly working with Beijing to undermine Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.\nMs Yau flatly denies this, and says her party has faced such accusations ever since it was founded.\n\"There are no external forces telling us what to do, to make long term plans, or betray Hong Kong.\"\nLooking amused, she adds: \"If we really were undercover agents, surely we'd still be in the legislative council - we wouldn't have let ourselves get kicked out, would we?\"\nMs Yau is known for being outspoken.\nShe supported gay marriage in her election campaign - despite receiving criticism for it - and also raised eyebrows when she said that Hong Kong's housing shortage meant that young people had \"no room to bang\".\nBut a lot of the comments about Ms Yau have focused on her gender and appearance, rather than her policies.\nOne newspaper wrote articles about what she wore to rallies, highlighting what they called her \"protest look\", while others nicknamed her \"goddess\" in reference to her appearance.\nAnd the sexism appears to have stepped up a notch since the oath-taking controversy. At one pro-Beijing protest, demonstrators stuck a photo of Ms Yau on a sex doll - and internet commentators have shared photos of Ms Yau's dress being hiked up during a scuffle in parliament.\nMs Yau says she believes the sexist attacks are \"not because of my gender - it's because my ideology is different from theirs\".\nHowever, experts have argued that the remarks are indicative of gender stereotyping in Hong Kong media - and worry that they could put off other women from entering politics.\nAs for Ms Yau, she says she will continue to work to fulfil her campaign pledges - even if she loses her appeal and her seat in parliament.\n\"The fact is that many Hong Kongers take [independence] as an aim for the future of Hong Kong,\" and the government can't ignore those voices, she says.\n\"I hope in the future, Hong Kong people have the power to choose their destiny and the future they want - whatever it is they decide to choose.\"\nAdditional reporting by BBC Chinese's Martin Yip", "summary": "Yau Wai-ching is the youngest woman to be elected to Hong Kong's parliament - and she has been called many things, including: \"radical\", \"goddess\",  \"spy\", \"pretty\" and \"cancer cell\"."}

That win put them in position to top the group by beating Slovakia.\nInstead, with nothing decided and with the group still open, Hodgson chose to leave out Rooney, Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Dele Alli, Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane.\nHodgson introduced Vardy and Daniel Sturridge, who both scored against Wales, as well as Clyne, Ryan Bertrand, Wilshere and Jordan Henderson. It gave England a disjointed look and they ran out of steam and threat long before the end.\nTime will tell if this was the selection that proved decisive in England's Euro 2016 campaign - but the bottom line is when you make a controversial choice such as that, you need to win and Hodgson's side failed.\nWilshere was given a starting role as Hodgson shuffled his squad to inject freshness and to give those on the margins some game time - but it was a move that failed.\nThe 24-year-old Arsenal midfielder looked exactly what he is at the moment: less than fully fit and off the pace after a Premier League season where injuries meant he barely featured.\nWilshere played just 141 minutes of Premier League football over three games at the end of Arsenal's season. This was no sort of preparation for a major tournament and it showed, but such is Hodgson's belief in his talents that he could not resist the temptation to select him, against all logic.\nHe strived to somehow revive his best moments but it was not to be - not through any lack of effort, simply a lack of spark, his natural game dulled by the long absences.\nWilshere looked a dejected figure as he went off to be replaced by Rooney after only 55 minutes, the possibility growing that his chances of making a serious impact on Euro 2016 badly damaged.\nThe result leaves them off to the south of France and Nice, playing next Monday instead of Saturday - but they will surely regret not finishing top of Group B.\nThis luxury now goes deservedly to Wales and while England will regard themselves as favourites to beat whoever finishes second in Group F, the price they pay could come further down the line.\nThey now go into the half of the draw containing France, Germany and Italy - and will also have to regain the impetus they had finally built up by beating Wales but was lost in this disappointing draw.\nNot a good night for England. Not a good night for Roy Hodgson.\nEngland manager Roy Hodgson: \"If we had won the game people would say we didn't miss them [the players who were left out] and when we don't they say the team selection is wrong, I am used to that one.\n\"Finishing second is a disappointment but we are still in the last 16 and who is to say the team we will play will be that much stronger?\n\"You just don't know, the way we are playing I am not frightened of anybody.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSlovakia coach Jan Kozak: \"Our players tired as the game went on and England showed their quality and strength, but when you see an opportunity you give everything you can.\n\"Perhaps I didn't expect to be pressed so deeply but we made some substitutions to neutralise the impact of their attack.\"\nEngland play their last-16 tie on Monday, 27 June at 20:00 BST, while Slovakia will have to wait to find out if they finish as one of the four best third-placed sides who progress.\nMatch ends, Slovakia 0, England 0.\nSecond Half ends, Slovakia 0, England 0.\nAttempt missed.

{"id": "33551340", "article": "When Google paid $3.2bn (\u00c2\u00a32.1bn) to buy Tony Fadell's start-up Nest in 2014, it got much more than just an internet-connected thermostat and smoke detector.\nIt got the man dubbed the \"the iPod's father\" - the engineer/designer who sold Steve Jobs on his vision of a portable music player, and then worked alongside Jony Ive to build it, update it and then repeat the process with the iPhone.\nNow, the two men are set to go head-to-head. First with wearable tech, and then later, perhaps, with competing car designs - more of which later.\nTellingly, Mr Fadell reveals he recently started testing Sir Jonathan's latest product, the Apple Watch, although he was not wearing it at the time of interview.\n\"I've had mine for about two weeks now,\" he says.\n\"I think they did a tremendous job on the hardware components of it.\n\"They are trying many different things with that platform - some are going to be great, and some are not.\"\nWhen Mr Fadell agreed to sell Nest to Google, the reason he gave was that joining forces would accelerate his \"thoughtful home\" master plan - he hates the term \"internet of things\", which he says does a \"disservice\" to his products.\nBut in January, it became clear that Google's chief executive, Larry Page, had wider uses for his hardware expertise, and the troubled Glass computer was added to his duties.\n\"It wasn't handed to me and said, 'Tony clean it up,'\" Mr Fadell clarifies, \"I offered.\"\n\"I remember what it was like when we did the iPod and the iPhone. I think this can be that important, but it's going to take time to get it right.\"\nThe $1,500 (\u00c2\u00a3965) \"explorer edition\" of Glass was soon pulled from sale, and Mr Fadell made clear that future test versions would be kept in-house.\nThat was widely seen as a shift in strategy for Google - a company that took five years to take its Gmail service out of \"beta\" status, and that still invites users to \"play\" with preview versions of other products.\nMoreover, it caused anger among developers who had sunk time and money into making apps for a product that no longer existed.\nBut Mr Fadell defends the shift, saying a distinction needed to be drawn between hardware and software.\n\"If you are only doing services based on electrons, you can iterate quickly, test it, and modify it and get it right,\" he says.\n\"But when you are dealing with actual atoms - hardware - and you have to get manufacturing lines and it takes a year or more to develop that product, you better understand what it is and what it's trying to do and specifically what it's not going to do.\n\"Customers have to spend money to buy those atoms.\n\"They want something that delivers value or you end up with a real disappointment and you can spoil the market.\"\nFor now, that leaves Mr Fadell's reputation dependent on his Nest line-up.\nIt is limited to three products, including the recently launched Nest Cam.\nThe motion-detecting camera streams live footage and sound from the owner's home to an app and can save memorable moments in the cloud.\nIf you get over the creepiness factor of effectively spying on your family, it's fair to say the device shares the crisp, stylish look of the Nest's other products, and reviews have been positive.\nBut the camera is actually an upgrade to an earlier device made by Dropcam - a company Nest acquired.\nThat means Mr Fadell's division has not created a new product category of its own since joining Google.\nBearing in mind, Mr Page told him to \"keep doing what you're doing, and do it as fast as you possibly can\", it raises the question: what's taking so long?\n\"Talk to me about the number of home product companies who have come out with three different product categories in less than five years... are shipping and they are the number ones in their category,\" says Mr Fadell, slightly bristling.\n\"I would love to have more, faster.\n\"But it takes time - it really takes time to make these products to the level of design and near-perfection that we achieve.\"\nHe adds that Nest's biggest goal right now is to expand the range of third-party products its devices talk to - for example its Thermostats can switch LG fridges into energy-saving mode when no-one's in, and its Protect sensors can make Philip's Hue lights flash red if they detect smoke or carbon monoxide.\nBut such advances have less impact than a new product.\n\"Despite his substantial success to date and involvement in key products such as Apple iPod, Mr Fadell has arguably not yet reached the truly iconic status bestowed upon Jonathan Ive,\" Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight, says.\n\"Given the huge amount Google invested in the acquisition of Nest to secure his services there must be an expectation that he too can deliver his own portfolio of truly disruptive devices with mass appeal.\n\"Google still lacks a smash-hit consumer electronics device of its own - it would be sensible to assume it hopes Mr Fadell can deliver that missing element.\"\nThe two men worked together on first iPods and iPhones, but are credited with different achievements.\nWith the iPod, Mr Fadell first convinced Steve Jobs of the wisdom of developing a portable music player and then worked out how to incorporate a hard drive - a fragile component - into a device that could be thrown about, sat on and generally abused.\nJony Ive's breakthrough was his design of its thumb-wheel, which scrolled through songs more rapidly as it was spun more quickly.\nWith the iPhone, perhaps Mr Fadell's greatest feat was finding a way to shrink the tech necessary to offer a multi-touch user interface on a handheld device.\nJony Ive's skill was best summed up by one writer as making the final product look almost more like \"a piece of jewellery than a gadget\".\nIn post-Jobs Apple, Sir Jonathan's influence has grown further - extending to the look of the company's operating system software, the creation of its Watch and even the design of its new headquarters.\nBy contrast, Mr Fadell has thrived beyond - building and selling a multi-billion dollar company, reinventing mundane household devices as desirable gadgets, and becoming one of Google's key figures.\nThis leads to thoughts about whether Mr Fadell could become involved in other Google projects.\nA question about working on its growing roster of robots is rebuffed on the grounds that they are still a long way from leaving the lab.\nBut self-driving cars, he adds, are much closer to launch and a \"big curiosity\".\n\"I don't think you've seen anything of what the design of the car could look like when it first materialises,\" he says.\n\"How do you make those occupants feel like they are safe and make sure they are safe?\n\"How does the car exude safety [and be] fashionable as well?\n\"How does this 'utility' self-driving car also be a reflection of you, right, as well as itself and also be transparent about its safety?\n\"Those are very interesting questions that still need to be dealt with.\"\nHe adds that he has \"some thoughts\" about the answers and is sharing them with others involved in Google's self-driving car project.\n\"We are having discussion about them all the time,\" he says.\n\"I always have ideas - it's whether or not people want to hear them.\"\nSo, nothing official yet.\nBut it would not be a surprise if Google eventually announces Mr Fadell is adding automobile design to his list of duties.\nAnd if, as rumoured, Sir Jonathan and his team are also working on their own electric car concept, that could set up a fascinating clash between the two former colleagues in the future.", "summary": "Is Tony Fadell destined to eclipse his former Apple workmate Sir Jonathan Ive?"}

Read on.\nProfile: Boris Johnson\nHow could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister?\nRead more about the UK's referendum on the EU\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\".\nHe first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You.\nHe still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU.\nAs a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015.\nLest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades.\nThat's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters.\nJust look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk.\nNot quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver.\nLast October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan.\nBut none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.\nMr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.\nHe said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and \"after a huge amount of heartache\". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially \"career-ending move\", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet.\nBut Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the \"Out\" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader.\nIn this, some suggest, he is implementing his long-standing policy on cake: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\"\nNo, that's Donald Trump. Also a pioneer of unorthodox political hair, but they don't get on.\nWhen Mr Trump commented that parts of London are \"so radicalised the police are afraid for their lives\", Mr Johnson retorted: \"The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\"\nNo, I've confused you now by mentioning Donald Trump.

What I'm saying is there were other people with responsibilities as well.\"\nThe Phelps report into the culture of Britain's cycling team criticised former technical director Shane Sutton and UK Sport, and noted a \"culture of fear\" existed within the team, according to many staff members.\n\"I don't accept there was a culture of fear and I spent a lot of time at the National Cycling Centre,\" said Cookson, who is seeking re-election after joining the UCI in 2013.\nHowever, he said Sutton should have been moved following recommendations from the King Review in 2012.\n\"One of the recommendations was that Shane be moved out of direct coaching with athletes,\" he said.\n\"As far as I understood in the first half of 2013, that was one of those action-plan elements that was implemented and it was after that in the middle of 2013 I became a candidate and then was elected to the UCI presidency.\"\nAustralian Sutton stayed on before resigning last year amid claims of sexism and was later found to have used sexist language towards cyclist Jess Varnish, though he was cleared of eight of the nine charges against him.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nCookson defended his record at British Cycling, saying: \"I'm not making any excuses for my behaviour. I think we made incredible progress and some great achievements.\n\"The idea we had no respect for athlete welfare is wrong. The relationship between athletes and coaches was something we were concerned about from time to time. Action was taken.\"\nAnd he disagrees with MP Damian Collins, who has called for board members from the period covered in the investigation to resign.\n\"My former colleagues at British Cycling have been committed to their sport over many years. Many of them are good people who have worked very hard,\" Cookson said.\nUK Anti-Doping is also investigating allegations of wrongdoing against Team Sky and British Cycling, which both deny.\n\"The reputational problems that have been around that team in the past few months have not been helpful. I want to wait for the outcome of UK Anti-Doping's enquiries,\" he said.\nCookson said cycling had made significant progress in the battle against cheating during his tenure at the UCI.\n\"We were previously considered pariahs in the anti-doping world.

But what is striking is that he refuses to accept wholesale blame.\nIn my interview with him, he points the finger firmly at UK Sport, saying one of their officials was embedded within the world-class cycling programme at the Manchester velodrome and was involved in management and monitoring.\nAny \"lacking\" must be shared, he believes. His message is, in effect: 'Why should the blame fall only on my shoulders?'\nShane Sutton, according to the 2012 King report, should have been moved away from direct coaching with athletes. We now know he referred to disabled cyclists as \"gimps and wobblies\" in addition to his role in Jess Varnish's departure from the British team.\nBut Cookson points to the fact he moved in 2013 to be president of the UCI and, in his absence, Sutton carried on working with cyclists unimpeded and with serious consequences.\nAgain, Cookson's overarching message is clear: nothing to do with me, guv.", "summary": "Brian Cookson, the head of cycling's world governing body, says blame for British Cycling's failings should not rest solely with him."}

but, equally, no employee should be in fear of being monitored by their boss.\"\nThe judges' ruling, handed down on Tuesday, said Romania had not failed to uphold the right to a private life of its citizen Bogdan Barbulescu.\nMr Barbulescu's employer had sacked him after finding he had been using a Yahoo Messenger account to speak to both his fiancee and his brother, despite having been asked to set up the account for work purposes only, the seven judges said.\nThe company had also banned private use of the internet at work.\nWhen confronted, Mr Barbulescu had denied violating the policy, the judges found.\nAnd the company had therefore been justified in reading both the work and private correspondence on the account - some of it highly sensitive.\nMr Barbulescu said his rights had been violated and, having been unsuccessful in arguing as much in the domestic courts, asked the judges to rule that Romania had failed in its duty to him.\nThe court's decision does not introduce new measures.\nReading the messages was already legal in Romania, as it is in other countries, including the UK.\nRather, it agreed with the Romanian authorities that the circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu's messages had been read did not represent a breach of his right to a private life.\nThe judges, in effect, declined to send a signal to courts across Europe that they considered surveillance under those circumstances unacceptable.\nIf the judges had found the other way, the Romanian government would have been obliged to abide by their decision.\nOthers, however, would not, because European Court of Human Rights decisions affect only the country named in the case.\nThe effect on domestic courts is different.\nEach country adopts its own approach to the court's decisions.\nIn the UK, for example, judges are obliged to take them into account, not to follow them without question, as has sometimes been claimed.\nMoreover, the court's decision did not actually go further than existing UK laws, which already allowed some reading of employees' communications under certain circumstances.\nOne of the seven judges, who disagreed with his colleagues, did say that the blanket ban on private internet use at work imposed by Mr Barbulescu's former employer was unacceptable and there should be stricter regulation of when and how bosses should be allowed to carry out such surveillance.\nThe case before the court considered the specific circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu found himself - rather than workplace surveillance as a whole - and agreed that they were not a breach of his rights.\nSo, avoiding those would be a good start.\nIn the UK, the amount of access employers have to employees' communications is defined by a series of laws and regulations that balance when it is lawful against when it is proportionate and necessary.\nEssex University professor of EU and human rights law Steve Peers told the BBC: \"Employees might be violating employer policies if they install software to block tracking.\n\"It is best for people to stick to company policy on use of work equipment and use their own smartphones if they need to do something personal.\n\"Definitely the wisest course for people whose company policies allow their work emails to be read - or who believe their employer would do it anyway - is to use their own phone or tablet, and use mobile data if they can, instead of employer wi-fi.\"\nApps that use end-to-end encryption, such as Signal, WhatsApp and others, provide an extra level of security.\nBroadly, \"the legal principles should be similar across Europe, particularly regarding personal data, as this is derived from EU legislation\", said Kathryn Dooks, an employment partner at the law firm Kemp Little.\nBut some domestic laws and regulations would differ, she told the BBC.\nThe banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, requires banking companies to \"take reasonable steps to record relevant telephone conversations, and keep a copy of relevant electronic communications\" on company equipment.\nFCA-regulated businesses must also take steps to stop staff sending work messages on their own equipment.\nAccording to a 2014 Financial Times article, some banks became so concerned employees, aware they were being watched, would move to non-work channels to engage in illicit behaviour that they started comparing performance against average internal communications channel use.", "summary": "Bosses have been urged not to indulge in invasive surveillance by reading their employees' private messages."}

A British tennis player as world number one is an idea as ludicrous to recent memory as anything else in that giddy list, but with Andy Murray, we should no longer be surprised.\nTo a nation systematically unable to produce tennis champions despite finances and facilities at the elite level to embarrass others as well as itself, Murray is the gift that keeps giving.\nOnly 26 men have held that solitary ranking since the calculations went computerised 43 years ago. It is not a gimmick, or a marketing exercise, or even a reward in itself, but a defining benchmark. You cannot fluke it or get lucky with a judging panel. It is deserved.

It also makes you a target. Everyone wants your scalp. Every defeat is automatically a headline.\nEven your own motivation can begin to slide, if only subconsciously, if only by minute fractions. How to focus on the next target when you can climb no further? Where can you go from the top but down?\nMurray's character may insulate him from those uncertainties for a while yet.\nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.\nThe 29-year-old's new position reflects both his own remarkable consistency over the past 12 months and the personal and physical problems that have shackled Djokovic, but it is also testament to a desire for self-improvement only occasionally found in sportsmen of his age.\nRanked 17th in the world a decade ago, he was gloriously log-jammed at four in those four seasons from 2008 to 2011, the unprecedented trio of Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal seeming to block any further ascent.\nHe dropped to sixth in 2014 after his back surgery and then appeared stymied at second for the past year as 12-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic went through the peak of his reign.\nThe belief and the hard work never dropped off. Different coaches, tweaked training, a renewed focus on the basics that, in this year alone, has seen his second serve refashioned and accelerated.\nIn defeat by Kei Nishikori in the US Open quarter-finals in September and Juan Martin del Potro in the Davis Cup semi-finals soon afterwards, he seemed physically spent - only to emerge revitalised in the past two months on this celebrated spree across first east Asia and now western Europe.\nAnd it is testament to self-belief too - that in an era decorated by three of the greatest players of all time, he could be crowned the best; that seven years and two months after first reaching number two, he could still take that final special step.\nPlenty of fine Grand Slam-winning players have never been world number one, Michael Chang, Goran Ivanisevic and Michael Stich among them.\nMany who have got there are arguably now in Murray's shadow: Pat Rafter, Carlos Moya, Marcelo Rios; definitely Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Thomas Muster; quite possibly Marat Safin and Andy Roddick, Ilie Nastase, Gustavo Kuerten and Lleyton Hewitt too.\nRankings in sport do not always reflect the accepted wisdom. Angelique Kerber may sit above Serena Williams in the women's tennis rankings, but with Williams having won five of their past six meetings and seven times as many career titles, the debate over who is the better player would be short.\nTriathlon's world rankings, based only on the year's World Series results, have Spain's Mario Mola as world number one, when every judge in the sport would define double Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee as the best in the world.\nFew could dispute Nick Faldo's claim to be the best golfer in the world when he topped golf's rankings. A few days after going to number one himself, Ian Woosnam would win the Masters.\nLuke Donald's ascension in 2011 was deserved - he was the first player in history to win the money title on both European and PGA tours in the same season - but because he had never finished as runner-up in a major, let alone won one, there were those who disputed the algorithm's accuracy. So too with Lee Westwood, number one in the same year, still to win a major five years on.\nThe number alone can be less important than the aura a player brings to it. After an unparalleled 12 months - that Davis Cup triumph, winning BBC Sports Personality for the second time, reaching his first French Open final, winning his second Wimbledon, taking Olympic singles gold yet again - Murray has that too.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAnd this may yet be the start of something even more beautiful, rather than the pinnacle.\nAfter five defeats in the Australian Open final, never will Murray have a better chance of winning it than this January, Federer and Nadal faded, Djokovic - his nemesis in four of those finals - jaded.\nThe French Open title could conceivably be the next unprecedented prize to be pouched. And then Wimbledon again, and why not, after all that has been before?\nIt is dreamy, fanciful stuff.

{"id": "17769529", "article": "The work shows that DNA and its chemical cousin RNA are not unique in their ability to encode information and to pass it on through heredity.\nThe work,  \n          reported in Science\n, is promising for future \"synthetic biology\" and biotechnology efforts.\nIt also hints at the idea that if life exists elsewhere, it could be bound by evolution but not by similar chemistry.\nIn fact, one reason to mimic the functions of DNA and RNA - which helps cells to manufacture proteins - is to determine how they came about at the dawn of life on Earth; many scientists believe that RNA arose first but was preceded by a simpler molecule that performed the same function.\nHowever, it has remained unclear if any other molecule can participate in the same unzipping and copying processes that give DNA and RNA their ability to pass on the information they carry in the sequences of their nucleobases - the five chemical group \"letters\" from which the the two molecules' genetic information is composed.\nThe classic double-helix structure of DNA is like a twisted ladder, where the steps are made from paired nucleobases (RNA is typically a single helix).\nPhilipp Holliger of the UK Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology and a team of colleagues created six different DNA- and RNA-like molecules - xeno-nucleic acids, or XNAs - by replacing not the nucleobases but the sugar groups that make up the sides of the ladder.\n\"There's a lot of chemisty that seeks to build alternative nucleic acids, and people have been modifying the bases, the sugars and the backbone, but what we were focusing on was the type of nucleic acid or polymers that would retain the ability to communicate with the natural DNA,\" Dr Holliger explained in an interview for the Science podcast.\nBecause the nucleobases themselves were the same as those of DNA and RNA, the resulting molecules were able to join with their natural counterparts.\nThe effect is similar to work  \n          recently published in Nature Chemistry\n, showing that another sugar-substituted DNA analogue could be made to pair up with DNA itself.\nBut the crucial point in creating a full \"synthetic genetics\" is a set of nucleic acids like DNA and RNA that can not only carry genetic information, but would also allow it to be changed and passed on - evolution and heredity.\nThat requires a set of helper molecules called polymerases, which, once DNA or RNA \"unzip\" and expose their genetic information, help create new DNA molecules from those instructions.\nDr Holliger and his colleagues have developed polymerases that efficiently transcribe the code of their synthetic DNA to natural DNA and then from that back to another synthetic DNA.\nThe process of evolution was encouraged in the lab; one of their DNA analogues was designed to cling to a particular protein or RNA target, those that failed to do so were washed away.\nAs successive copies of those that stuck were made, variations in the genetic code - and the resulting structure the molecules took on - led to ever more tightly attached XNAs.\n\"We've been able to show that both heredity - information storage and propagation - and evolution, which are really two hallmarks of life, can be reproduced and implemented in alternative polymers other than DNA and RNA,\" Dr Holliger explained.\n\"There is nothing 'Goldilocks' about DNA and RNA - there is no overwhelming functional imperative for genetic systems or biology to be based on these two nucleic acids.\"\nIn  \n          an accompanying article in Science\n, Gerald Joyce of the Scripps Research Institute wrote that \"the work heralds the era of synthetic genetics, with implications for exobiology (life elsewhere in the Universe), biotechnology, and understanding of life itself\".\nBut the work does not yet represent a full synthetic genetics platform, he pointed out. For that, a self-replicating system that does not require the DNA intermediary must be developed.\nWith that in hand, \"construction of genetic systems based on alternative chemical platforms may ultimately lead to the synthesis of novel forms of life\".", "summary": "Researchers have succeeded in mimicking the chemistry of life in synthetic versions of DNA and RNA molecules."}

They could be fast-tracked to specialists in hospital.\nIt was the cancer cases where patients either had vague or more difficult to diagnose symptoms - or the small number of cancers found in patients who said they were ill but mostly needed a quick test or scan to rule something serious out.\n\"We looked at 30,000 cancer cases - and more than 25% of all cancer cases were from this group where we didn't think it was something but it suddenly showed as being something and so it's important to find those cases,\" said Prof Olesen.\nWhat were the changes?\nThe model of care introduced in Denmark has three routes.\nFirst -  for patients with \" alarm\" symptoms of specific cancers - there are fast-track diagnosis and treatment routes with strict time targets.\nIn addition to that, by law, any patient with a physical illness in Denmark must be investigated within 30 days of a GP referral.\nSecond, the Danish health service from 2007 set up diagnosis centres - at existing hospitals and clinics - where patients with symptoms which GPs cannot diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them, whether it is cancer or something else.\nGP Dr Hanne Heje, who works in Aarhus - a city slightly smaller than Cardiff - said the new system helps doctors who suspect something is wrong but not necessarily cancer.\nIt also stops the \"ping pong\" between GPs and different specialists.\n\"Now we know there's a department meeting the patient with open arms saying 'we welcome you', even though there's not a diagnosis written on their forehead,\" she said.\nThe third route deals with the group of patients with minor symptoms, which are very unlikely to be cancer but in rare cases could be.\nThese patients go to so-called \"yes-no\" centres which offer a simple test or scan so they can be seen quickly and any problems identified.\n\"This can be solved within hours in some cases but 1% will have a serious disease and this can be detected,\" said Prof Olesen.\n\"For these patients before - they might have had to wait four to six months, so for the small percentage where something is found, they'd start treatment six months behind the time schedule.\"\nThe results so far\nProf Olesen - a former GP himself - said the changes have not led to a \"flooding of the system\" by more GP referrals but better organisation of how patients are diagnosed within existing resources.\nImportantly, he says it has also led to better survival rates.\n\"We've got very optimistic results showing Norway, Sweden and Finland are becoming better year by year,\" he said. \"But very clearly in the data Denmark is becoming better, a faster pace than before and catching up and getting closer to where we should be.\"\nDenmark has a similar health system in how it is funded and organised to Wales.\nHe said there could be lessons shared between Wales and Denmark on how better organisation can help \"in catching up the elite in Europe\".\nDr Tom Crosby, medical director of the Wales Cancer Network, said he had been impressed with how the Danish health service had broken down the barriers between GPs and specialists to work better together.\nHe said: \"People are not just doing tests in isolation - they are working together to achieve a diagnosis.\"", "summary": "Denmark's health service - which is similar to the NHS -  started to look in depth at the problem of cancer survival rates in 2000."}

{"id": "32066326", "article": "There was a certain tension in the air last night, as Mr Speaker Bercow presided at a farewell dinner for Deputy Speaker Dawn Primarolo; later today she'll probably be presiding over a short Commons debate that might decide whether the Speaker will need a farewell dinner of his own\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.\nThe ambush was brilliantly laid. Tory MPs were kept in Westminster for a party election briefing from their campaign supremo, Lynton Crosby. Labour and Lib Dem MPs were heading off to their constituencies to campaign, secure in the assumption that there was no controversial business left to vote on. So the Conservatives have the numbers and the other parties don't.\nAt 5.30pm on Wednesday, the Leader of the House dropped in to see the Speaker, to tell him the government was putting down a motion to change the Commons Standing Orders on the re-election of the Speaker, after a General Election.\nI'd love to have been a fly on that office wall.\nUnder the old rules, MPs are presented with a motion that the incumbent Speaker should resume the Chair; if it is opposed, they march through the lobbies. The change would put in a secret ballot, instead. The importance of this is that open opposition to a sitting Speaker, who is then re-elected, can invite years of retribution, with offenders called late to speak, if at all and all kinds of subtle shafting beyond that.\nA secret ballot, the argument goes, would allow the more timorous MPs to vote against a Speaker without fear of revenge.\nThe idea has been floating about for years - it was mooted by the Commons Procedure Committee back in 2011, although the committee has since changed its mind. And even when there was plenty of spare Commons time available, it was never debated. Incidentally the Committee chair, the Conservative Charles Walker, who helped drag Speaker Bercow to the Chair in 2009, was not consulted on the decision to put one of his committee's ex-recommendations to the House.\nLabour are furious.\nI hear they're trying to pull MPs back - and may be helped by the three urgent questions the Speaker has (spookily enough) allowed today, which will allow extra time for them to get back. Lib Dem MPs are not being whipped in support of the motion - or indeed encouraged to come back if they've headed off to their constituencies.\nHow will Tory MPs be whipped? Their attendance is being required on a strict three line whip - but does that extend to a whip on a House matter? Inquiring backbenchers will be seeking an answer on that point. Will ministers vote? And, of course, even if the vote is officially a free vote, the fact that the motion is signed by the Leader of the House makes it pretty official, and Conservative whips may - unofficially, of course - be encouraging colleagues into the Yes Lobby.\nWhat will the upshot be? My guess is that the Conservative strategy has been successful and that the motion will be carried; apart from anything else there is plenty of support for the general principle of secret ballots for this kind of vote.\nBut the ambush by which the majority has been achieved has ruffled feathers. Rumour reaches me of a bitter exchange between the Shadow Leader of the House, Angela Eagle and Messrs Hague and Gove. And this could imply a breakdown of trust in the \"usual channels\" through which much Commons business is stage-managed.\nExpect more venom in today's exchanges.\nI'm not sure that would be a bad thing, in many ways, but it wouldn't be much fun for MPs if it meant endless late night votes and counter-ambushes. The last time relations broke down, in the 1970s, the ensuing months of grind arguably drove a number of elderly members to an early grave.\nMeanwhile it might be premature to assume that a secret ballot dooms Speaker Bercow. He has some support on the Tory benches, and his survival would depend on the mathematics of the next House of Commons. But there's a deeper question: is the Speakership now becoming mired in party politics? Might we see incoming majorities defenestrating uncongenial Speakers as a matter of routine?\nCertainly in a hung parliament, the rulings from the Chair could be critical - and providing a simpler way of removing a Speaker could be quite convenient for future cross party alliances or governments.\nOne final thought. Watch Sir Gerald Kaufman. Barring the unexpected, he will be the Father of the House in the next Commons and will preside over the Speaker (re) election process.\nOne of the urgent questions granted today is from him - and he's said to be furious about the Conservatives' actions.", "summary": "What a week - first Clarkson, then Zayn, and now Bercow?"}
{"id": "40543268", "article": "It was gobsmacking, unbelievable, enthralling and explosive throughout, featuring huge momentum swings and with outstanding individual performances in all three Tests.\nI thought beforehand that if they lost the first Test the Lions would lose the series 3-0, so I have to give credit to what is the strongest Lions side since 2001, or maybe even 1997, for the way they fought back.\nThe quality shone through both in the players and the coaching.\nAfter the first week or so the debate about lack of preparation time died down - that is one for the administrators to sort out behind closed doors.\nBut just think what they could have done with 10 days' more time to get ready - they might even have gone in as favourites against the world champions.\nThis will be a tour remembered for Sean O'Brien's try in the first Test.\nThe Lions may have lost that match but it was a wonder try, and now the lads have managed to draw the series that score will be the one that sticks in the memory.\nAlthough that might be the standout moment, to be honest pretty much every moment of every Test was a defining moment - it really was that good.\nThe most significant moment was Sonny Bill Williams' red card in the second Test. You don't know for certain what the outcome would have been had he not been sent off, but it's more than likely New Zealand would have won.\nThat was effectively two defining moments - the impact of his shoulder with Anthony Watson's head, and the moment referee Jerome Garces - correctly - decided it was a red-card offence.\nIt was a huge momentum swing in both the match and the series, although it didn't seem so immediately because the Lions proceeded to give away loads of penalties and slip nine points behind, before finally starting to believe in themselves and scoring two great tries as they fought back to win.\nAnother pivotal moment would have been conversations after the first Test because the Lions had been dominated physically in many cases.\nThe conversations must have been along the lines of looking players in the eye and saying: \"Are you genuinely up for this?\"\nWarren Gatland's decision to field the back three of Liam Williams, Watson and Elliot Daly in the second Test was a bit of a surprise but, as before with the coach's decisions, it worked out.\nAnd then there's the penalty that then wasn't in the final Test.\nSam Warburton dug deep into the Lions' legacy and his own mental reserves to prevent New Zealand doing what they wanted to do with the ball.\nBut arguably his biggest contribution was being respected enough by Romain Poite for the referee to change his decision and decide to award a scrum to New Zealand, rather than a very kickable penalty, right at the end of Saturday's decider.\nIt was huge because, unless I've got the rules wrong, it was a penalty as the ball was avoidable for Ken Owens, while a scrum says contact was accidental.\nHe caught it and although it was maybe a reflex action, catching and then releasing the ball suggests he could have avoided it.\nI have to say 'God bless the Kiwis', because on the pitch they accepted it. They will talk to the referee after the game, but during matches they just get on with it. They set the standards.\nJonathan Davies was very good and was the Lions players' man of the series but for me the best player in a red shirt was Taulupe Faletau.\nThe Wales number eight was so consistent, and I believe there's even more to come.\nHe's a phenomenal athlete with a fantastic engine, which allows him to always play for 80 minutes in both defence and attack.\nI'd still like to see more of him carrying in the wider channels, but he was my man of series.\nRugby is such a squad game it's a shame you have to pick individuals but Taulupe is a bit of an unsung hero and his work-rate and ability mean he made a massive contribution.\nHis Wales team-mate Davies had a fine series.\nHe made some great breaks, he was solid in defence without being headline-making, he assumed the role of carrying to the gainline in the second and third Tests, came up with a couple of good relieving kicks and played well all round.\nMaro Itoje showed his growing maturity by the way he pushed the boundaries - he was knowingly offside and doing it for a reason, which is great when you get away with it.\nHe was magnificent in the third Test and at one point made four tackles in about 45 seconds.\nHis willingness to be involved is staggering and a benchmark for anyone who wants to be the best.\nOwen Farrell's mental ability to step back and kick crucial penalties, especially after he missed a couple of kicks early in the tour, shows his ability to totally zone in when he has to - something New Zealand's Beauden Barrett, for all his other abilities, doesn't seem able to do.\nO'Brien was also impactful on the flank and made sure the Lions were on the front foot both in attack and defence, and his Ireland team-mate Conor Murray was very good at the base, helping run the game.\nI hope this series is a springboard for the home unions to believe there can be a shift in power in terms of the world rankings and beating the southern hemisphere teams on a more regular basis.\nLet's get fitter and really test ourselves.\nI don't think many of the home unions can compete on skills in the forwards with New Zealand but the back three the Lions fielded was probably more skilful and adventurous than that of the hosts, which shows the possibilities are there.\nThere was some talk going into the series that the future of the Lions was once again under threat and what's interesting is that the posturing is coming from the clubs.\nI would like to think they're clever enough to go and do the negotiations behind the scenes now because they must realise how secure the Lions' future is.\nAsk a player, coach or supporter if they think the Lions is here to stay and there will be a resounding yes.

And that's great, there's no-one else in the loop.\"\nProfits from the computer games sales have also been used to expand the business into other areas, such as buying 2000 AD, home to cult comic character Judge Dredd.\nWhile Jason won't reveal the exact cost of the deal, he says it was \"many millions\".\n\"We felt that 2000 AD was on the decline [under its then-Danish owner], and needed to be owned and cherished by someone British who knew the culture of what it was trying to do.\n\"I genuinely think it is an important bit of our cultural heritage.\"\nGaming industry expert Dan Maher says that Rebellion has been particularly praised for its custodianship of the 2000 AD comic book.\n\"As the name suggests, the company prides itself on going against the grain, using the money earned from an industry driven by bleeding-edge technology to make uncynical acquisitions in the traditional publishing sector,\" says Mr Maher.\n\"Such moves, driven as they are by real love and appreciation for comics and sci-fi, have earned them great respect from consumers and professionals alike.\"\nJason has the boss role on a day-to-day basis at Rebellion, while his brother Chris holds the chief technology officer position.\nBut before he goes to work, Jason spends two hours every morning looking after his 13 horses, and then two hours again in the evening.\n\"Yes I could afford to get staff to do it all for me but I like doing it.

In many other parts of the country, there is no significant problem filling most teacher vacancies.\nCouncil umbrella body Cosla says the problem is in what it calls particular \"pockets\" of the country - rather than a national problem as such.\nIn each of the last four years the Scottish government has increased student teacher numbers. It also argues it has addressed teacher unemployment and stabilised teacher numbers in recent years, and has dismissed any suggestions of a Scotland-wide shortage.\nThere are a number of possible explanations for the problems in northern Scotland.\nFor example, the cost of housing in some parts of the north east - an important factor in the overall cost of living - may deter people from moving there if they know their salary would go further in another part of the country.\nYoung people\nIn rural areas, it can be a challenge to find the right person for any skilled job.\nYoung people from rural areas who want to become teachers will usually have left home at 18 to study - many may simply not fancy returning to a rural community, at least while they are in their 20s or 30s.\nIt is important to distinguish between the drop in the overall number of teachers in Scotland in recent years and the all-too-real challenge some councils face filling advertised vacancies.\nCouncils across Scotland are now committed to trying to maintain teacher numbers - the current council funding deal with the Scottish government makes this a formal obligation.\nBut filling vacancies requires, of course, finding the right candidates.\nCouncils in the north have tried a number of ideas - promoting what they believe to be the advantages of living in their area, for instance, or providing free accommodation.\nDifferent challenge\nOne contentious issue is over just who can become a teacher.\nAll teachers in Scotland have to register with the General Teaching Council for Scotland, but teachers from outside Scotland have to meet specific requirements.\nThe biggest number of teachers from outside Scotland come, inevitably, from the rest of the UK. However teachers in England who, in effect, learned on the job as graduate trainees through the UK government's Teach First initiative cannot register in Scotland.\nHead teacher vacancies throw up a different challenge though.\nHead teachers are often promoted from within their own council area - they may go for a promoted post at their own school or a nearby school.

{"id": "37989821", "article": "The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe.\nBritain has done better when it has played its traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America's swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally.\nThis Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of its history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need it least.\nSince the president-elect's shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered its balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration.\nIts public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's latest description of the president-elect, in a Czech newspaper: \"Donald Trump is dealmaker, he is a guy who believes firmly in values that I believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as I understand, he is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York.\"\nThis is a long way from the criticisms that he and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But both are now eating their words without shame, for they believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever his character, temperament and policy agenda.\nThe prime minister's Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that she has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that she understood the forces that led to his election and the shared need for the whole world to address them.\nIn contrast, some EU countries have worn their hearts on their sleeve and expressed their dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions they find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a \"whinge-o-rama\".\nSome British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump's election to drive forward her own agenda for more EU defence cooperation.\nShe was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson's refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was \"normal\" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in its relations with the US.\nAs if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with his EU counterparts over Turkey, urging them not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump's anti-globalisation arguments just as they prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti-establishment flag.\nSo on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when its overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot-headed spats over who is going to which meeting.\nAnd all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table.\nWhat happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group?\nThis was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in their telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to his word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place itself at odds with either the US or the EU.\nThis is the context for Mrs May's trip to Berlin on Friday where she will meet President Obama and four of her most important European counterparts, from Germany, France , Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe.\nShe has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president-elect who cannot be ignored. But equally she will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump-led Washington.\nThe UK-US relationship is hardly special at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo-opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office.\nMr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as \"probably... my closest international partner these eight years\".\nIn vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote: \"Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America... but unique did not mean affectionate.\"\nSo the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump's incipient administration and do what it can - if anything - to shape and influence his foreign policy before firm positions are established.\nOfficials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January.\nThe Foreign Office is already holding talks with the Trump team about the possibility of Mr Johnson travelling to Washington to meet the Vice-President-elect, Mike Pence, and potentially others in the Trump team in the next few weeks. Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming his ambassadorial role with Mr Trump.\nBut at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support it still has in Europe's chancelleries.\nThe former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain's focus should be on Europe. \"For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States,\" he said.\nIn the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain's traditional foreign policy assumptions.\nThe government needs to repair relations with both the US and the EU while not antagonising both in process.\nFalling between the two geopolitical stools would leave the UK floundering mid-Atlantic without a paddle.", "summary": "In the arc of history, Britain has rarely flourished when it has had to choose between Europe and the United States."}

{"id": "29160114", "article": "In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC he discusses a number of cricketing issues, including his concerns for the future of Test cricket and next summer's Ashes series in England.\n\"At this time I won't be putting my money on England, but, I will say this about the World Cup; we play Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Australia then three minnows, so if you win against the three minnows, you're into the quarter-finals.\n\"Although we seem to be at sixes and sevens, one-day cricket is a funny game. If you play very well and you get good decisions going for you and bad ones for the opposition, if you get a bit of luck, you can go through on that day and suddenly you're in the semi-final.\"\n\"I think they do focus, they're just not very good at it. Test cricket is more important for England and there's nothing wrong with that. We play quite a lot of one-dayers, we just don't play it very well.\n\"Instead of making excuses maybe we should put our hand up and say it isn't working and we have to have a re-think and open up our minds a bit and get into the modern way. We're still trying to play nice cricket with our opening batsmen. Other teams come in and they plunder it these days. It has taken a long time to get Alex Hales in, who is powerful, and give him a go. That seems to be the modern game, there is a lot of power involved.\"\n\"We're not sure who should play in the middle order - we dropped Ravi Bopara, who was quite good. The selectors are very nice people - James Whitaker, chairman, Mick Newell of Notts - but they have never played international cricket. I think James has played one Test match. Gus Fraser, who I admire, he hasn't played international cricket for over 10 years and the coach Peter Moores, he has never played anything at all, so if I was batting I don't think I'd be asking him for advice.\n\"I think it's an important factor, it's not belittling them. I don't think you have to be a great player but I do think you have to have played some international cricket, and been around the international scene, been on tour. [Former national selector] Geoff Miller was very good, 34 Tests. He wasn't a great name, but he'd been around lots of tours and I'm sure that helps.\"\n\"The second-string seam bowling. Stuart Broad and James Anderson are very, very good but it's the second string when the pressure on the opposition eases quite alarmingly. They're trying people at the moment like Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, who's got an awful run-up, and it's not there yet. Off-spin, left-arm spin, they don't seem to have one. Moeen Ali's getting a go but Graeme Swann has been a big loss.\n\"Then the batting isn't solid enough. I've always believed in Test cricket you win from a platform of runs on the board. I'm quite aware of the old saying you need bowlers to take 20 wickets to win, but it's very difficult if your batsmen don't make any runs and bowlers are always under pressure.\n\"The best sides make a lot of runs, they're never really in much danger. We have too many low scores, too many difficulties where we're climbing a mountain for batting badly in the first innings. We don't put enough big scores on the board.\"\n\"The umpires feel more comfortable being able to report them in privacy rather than having to call them in a match. The Laws of the game are held by MCC, from Test cricket to school cricket. The ICC decide, just like the PGA Tour in golf, to have localised rules and they have this rule whereby you can bend and straighten your arm 15 degrees, that is a local rule by the ICC and not the Laws of the game. Many of us don't agree with it but we live by it because that's the rules.\n\"I have always believed to bowl the doosra you have to bend and straighten your arm - that's throwing. Now they have legalised throwing up to 15 degrees. You can tell as a cricketer when somebody has a funny action, but the ICC has chosen at international level to have some boffins in a studio with lights and camera and all kinds of mechanics to say he bends and straightens it - which is really a euphemism for throwing - 10 degrees, so he's alright.\"\n\"Last time in England it was pretty close, it should have been 2-2. It will be close again and it depends how we develop by next year.\n\"England are hoping Moeen will improve. He's done alright so far, his batting has shown glimpses, his bowling has shown glimpses but he's got to do a bit more than that. You can't just flit in and out with your batting and bowling to play well at Test level.\n\"If Mitchell Johnson gets injured and can't play, the odds may come towards England, but Ryan Harris is important too. He has had injuries, so they may have to nurse him a bit. At the moment, they're better placed than us, although in sport it can change quickly.\"\n\"It's a problem and we might have missed the boat, it might be too late. It will still be alright while I'm alive but I don't know about 30 or 40 years. There is nothing certain about Test cricket because as much as we love it and we think it's the best test of a cricketer for his character, his courage and his technique, one-day cricket has become so important to people.\n\"We've seen for the first time in England that when it's not Australia it's difficult to sell the seats. Lord's will always sell out because it's the Mecca, people want to go, it's an iconic place. But at Headingley or Southampton we're struggling to sell the seats and that will happen more and more.\"\n\"I've thought for a long time the ticket prices are too high. The people who run the game might find they are going to have to address that in the coming years.\n\"For years, I have advocated that two grown-ups and two youngsters free should be a family ticket to make it more affordable, but next year the best tickets will be over \u00a3100 at Lord's and more than \u00a380 at other places.\n\"For a couple, that's a hundred and plenty, so they might think 'let's go somewhere else that doesn't cost as much'. That will happen more and more.\"\n\"I haven't a clue. I won't have a say in it will I?\n\"Adversity never breaks a good man, it fines him down like gold so he rises up a better man. You should never be afraid of adversity, it's what you do about it that counts. I've had my share.

{"id": "40458642", "article": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nOf his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine.\nWinning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable.\nAnd yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price.\nMurray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern.\nOpting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer?\nAlthough it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMurray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets.\nAs well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells.\nThough he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open.\nSo, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon.\nMurray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final.\nIt would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years.\nYet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field.\nHe has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way.\nThis year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%.\nHe claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden.\nBut perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter.\nThat may not be a concern much longer.\nMurray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest.\nIn fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further.\nNadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further.\nAnd then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device", "summary": "Of his last 30 matches in 2016, Andy Murray won 28 and lost just two."}

I'm a huge believer in improving life through technology, and am very excited to be a part of the revolution,\" she says.\nTwo of the most popular offers on Gummie are a walking tour focusing on graffiti in the Woodstock area of Cape Town, and a similar activity, but by bicycle, in Johannesburg.\n\"I believe it reflects a trend of growing interest for African urban culture and street art,\" Ms Mardina says.\nCape Town-based VoiceMap is moving tour-guiding into the digital space. The company's app combines map technology with podcasts. It doesn't just guide tourists around South Africa. Some 72 city tours worldwide are available.\nUsers can auto-publish tours on the platform, so anyone in the world can create a personal, niche audio tour of their town. A number of celebrities have also recorded tours of specific areas.\nAccording to VoiceMap's founder Iain Manley, it's changing the way people experience travel.\n\"GPS audio tours change the whole experience. You can move at your own pace, stopping for as many photos as you like. You also have access to storytellers who don't do tours,\" he says.\nNeither are you traipsing behind a guide clutching a flag. \"This allows you to blend in and have a much more natural experience,\" Mr Manley says.\nTechnology is creating the \"invisible guest\", with many tourism providers, such as hotels, finding they have very little interaction with guests who have a new independence thanks to their mobile devices, he says.\n\"People are more interested in doing things the same ways locals would, and blending in where they can,\" Mr Manley concludes.\nSouth Africa's Cape Innovation and Technology Initiative (CiTi) has launched a dedicated hub in Cape Town to support local travel tech innovation.\n\"We aim to build the profile of local travel-tech businesses and start-ups, share information about locally relevant travel-tech trends, create stronger connections between the different parts of the travel ecosystem... and create a buzzing hub for travel-tech companies to find a home,\" says Ian Merrington, CiTi's chief executive.\nLocal companies understand what makes their country special, he believes, and understand the potential difficulties a traveller may face. So they are in an ideal position to create apps and platforms best suited to this new breed of independent traveller.\n\"Inspiring today's travellers looking for that special holiday, and then connecting them seamlessly with those experiences through technology is going to be a significant competitive advantage for any destination,\" he says.\nMany of the travel tech innovations being implemented in Africa try to make bookings easier, facilitate payments, or make information and options available to tourists.\nIt's all about improving the customer experience for tourists, says Tumi Sankoloba, ICT research associate at consultancy Frost & Sullivan Africa.\nThe growth in smartphone and internet availability is supporting a \"consumerisation\" of technology, he says, removing tourists' reliance on third-party agents for information.\nHe also sees an opportunity for wearable travel devices to take off, citing the US company Trip Case, an itinerary management app that can be paired with smart watches.\n\"Innovative apps such as Trip Case notify travellers about flight times, delays, places to see and also updates time zone - all on the device,\" he says.\nBig data analytics could also have a big impact on the travel industry, he believes.\n\"Big data allows businesses to personalise the offers made to travellers and cater to their individual needs and, thus, increase the likelihood of purchase,\" says Mr Sankoloba.\nSo tech is changing tourism in South Africa and elsewhere, giving travellers more choice, control and information.\nFollow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter\nClick here for more Technology of Business features", "summary": "South Africa is the stuff of dreams for the intrepid traveller."}

After winning possession, Naismith ran into the area to receive a Baines pass before stabbing a shot at goal. Rodriguez tried to clear, but the ball cannoned off goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, and hit the Wolfsburg full-back again before ending up in his own net.\nThat was Everton's first goal in Europe at Goodison Park since beating Sporting Lisbon 2-1 in February 2010, and it had the buoyant home crowd hungry for more.\nEverton duly attempted to deliver, with full-backs Baines and Coleman becoming more adventurous as Wolfsburg offered little going forward, and their attacking instincts resulted in the home side's second goal on the stroke of half-time.\nMirallas's drive was weakly pushed into the path of Baines, who had followed the shot into the area, and he knocked the ball across goal for Coleman to nod in.\nWolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking introduced Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt for the start of the second half, but within seconds of the restart Everton went further ahead. This time, Robin Knoche's foul on McGeady was deemed to have occurred inside the area, and Baines confidently despatched the resulting penalty.\nThe goal effectively ended Wolfsburg's hopes of returning to Germany with anything to show but, with nothing to lose, they embarked on a spell of dominance.\nFor a good 30 minutes they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and attempts on goal, as Tim Howard produced saves from Luiz Gustavo's opportunistic shot and Rodriguez's well-struck free-kick.\nFormer Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner was introduced after the hour, with Wolfsburg boss Hecking sensing a possible goal, but instead it was Everton who grabbed a fourth. Mirallas peeled away from defenders to run on to substitute Samuel Eto'o's through ball and he coolly slotted in at Benaglio's near post.\nThere was still time for Wolfsburg to get the consolation their 27 shots on goal deserved, Rodriguez making some amends for his early own goal with a curling free-kick.\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"The atmosphere was perfect for us to start a very good performance.\n\"I thought there were two very good sides.

But some portion of it would have condensed into small spherules in the sky to then rain back down on the bowl.\nIt should be stressed that the nickel is not in itself an identification of asteroid material.\nTo have real confidence, the scientists would prefer to see the element iridium.\nThis is extremely rare on Earth but is frequently associated with meteorites.\nIridium is apparent in the geological layers around the globe that mark the dinosaur-killing event at the end of the Cretaceous Period, but to find it in the actual crater would be an exciting observation. It could result in further insights on the nature of the asteroid that smashed into Earth. One theory is that its metals could have made the environment toxic for many lifeforms.\nFour labs are currently testing for the presence of iridium. Prof Philippe Claeys from the Free University in Brussels says finding the Nickel is a very good sign.\n\"Nickel behaves chemically in a way that is very similar to iridium; it loves to make strong chemical bonds with iron, just like iridium,\" he told BBC News.\n\"So we treat nickel as what we call a proxy for an elevated concentration of iridium. If we see high nickel, it's very likely that we're going to have high iridium.\"\nChicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth\nThe project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP).

{"id": "34994457", "article": "Probably not - for two sets of reasons.\nFirst, the basic facts have not changed - there is no doubt that the situation inside the Labour Party remains dangerously unstable, with probably a majority of Labour MPs deeply uncomfortable with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.\nBut his is a leadership his party members want, overwhelmingly so. And were a coup to be staged the membership would either re-elect him, or elect someone similar.\nWe're in Bertolt Brecht territory here: the easiest solution for Corbyn-sceptic MPs would be to dissolve the party membership and elect another, as the poet ironically suggested for the Communist regime in 1953.\nBut, failing that, they have to wait for the membership to change its mind.\nThe tactics of any coup attempt revolve around the different views of what might have to occur to trigger such a change.\nSome think serious electoral reverses in next May's round of elections (the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, the London mayor etc) might do the trick.\nLondon could be particularly significant, both as the place where Labour did best at the election in May and as the heartland of the Corbynistas.\nThe argument is that the election of a Tory mayor and a rough ride on the doorstep might re-educate enough of the new wave of Labour members to allow a different leader to be elected.\nOthers argue that it might take two such rounds of May defeats to change enough minds. This, of course, relies on those defeats actually occurring, not to mention them having the effect the anti-Corbyn camp want. We shall see.\nAnd it's also worth underlining that the Syria intervention is an issue where Mr Corbyn is in tune with his membership.\nThen there's the not insignificant question of how a leadership challenge would be triggered.\nI'm told some Labour MPs have been digging into the archives to study how Hilary's dad, Tony Benn, went about challenging Neil Kinnock, in 1988, and that legal opinions on what Labour's murky and overlapping internal rules might actually mean are being studied in various Westminster offices.\nOne of the key questions is whether Mr Corbyn, if challenged, would need to be nominated by 35 MPs in order to defend his position or whether he would be assured of an automatic position on the ballot papers.\nSecond, there's the climate within the parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). One of the key problems for the coup plotters is identifying an alternative leader, to play Michael Howard to Mr Corbyn's Iain Duncan Smith, and at least keep the Labour show on the road in the 2020 election.\nMr Benn has certainly put his head above the parapet - but he's done so on an issue that is highly divisive within the PLP, rather than one of the several causes which pit most Labour MPs against their leader.\nTake a look at the voting list on Wednesday, where two married couples - Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey and Jenny Chapman and Nick Smith - were split on the issue.\nIn that agonised atmosphere, Mr Benn's moral certainties may not play well in the longer term, whatever their on the day impact.\nHe may have given a masterly Commons performance (a real rarity these days) and made a powerful speech setting out the moral case for military intervention, in terms that had many Tory, as well as Labour, MPs swooning.\n\"He's clearly running for the leadership - but of which party?\" tittered one SNP MP.\nBut most of Mr Benn's Labour colleagues were conflicted about the issue of whether intervention would work\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and I'm not sure the appeal he made to their internationalist roots and to memories of Arthur Greenwood \"speaking for England\" in 1940 will have won over those who doubt both their leader and the case for military action.\nCertainly there were plenty of MPs from what might be called the \"right\" of the PLP who didn't back the government motion.\nSo it may be worth watching other figures who didn't break cover last night - Rachel Reeves, anyone?\nAll the same, Mr Corbyn's position has been weakened. He was forced to concede a free vote, under the threat of losing much of his shadow cabinet.\nHe was comprehensively outperformed by his shadow foreign secretary and some of his internal critics suspect that competence rather than ideology might be the most corrosive issue for his leadership.\nThis week also saw brutal meetings of the shadow cabinet and the PLP, and, ultimately, a significant chunk of the front bench voting with the government (Hilary Benn, Michael Dugher, Maria Eagle, Angela Eagle, Vernon Coaker, Tom Watson, Lucy Powell, Heidi Alexander, Chris Bryant, Gloria De Piero and Luciana Berger, for the record).\nAnd that list included one of his personal left-field picks for high office, the shadow health secretary Ms Alexander. She's proved an effective performer, but I suspect her name is mud in the Corbyn inner circle.\nNow there will be recriminations and, possibly, attempts at constituency level to deselect the recusants (there does not have to be a return to the '80s era of mandatory reselection; the coming Commons boundary changes will ensure most sitting MPs will not face a simple rubber-stamping to become their party's candidate again).\nIf they succeed, some MPs may quit immediately, forcing uncomfortable by-elections, or simply go rogue in the Commons and vote as they please.\nWe're still some way from further 80s retro developments like an SDP-style breakaway. And defections to the Liberal Democrats seem improbable, both because of the extent of their implosion last May and because a lot of Labour MPs regard the party's new leader, Tim Farron, as \"Corbyn lite\".\nSo we're left with a destabilised official opposition and no obvious way to resolve its problems that does not involve a major smackdown.\nThings will get worse in the Labour Party before they get better.\nFind out how your MP voted\nFind out which constituency you live in\n*The Commons is made up of 650 MPs but the Speaker and his three deputies cannot vote while Sinn Fein's four MPs do not take their seats and did not take part.\n*There is also currently no MP for Oldham West and Royton, with a by-election taking place on Thursday.", "summary": "Does Hilary Benn's barnstorming performance in the Syria debate mean he's about to displace his leader in some kind of Labour palace coup?"}

{"id": "19508906", "article": "Norwegian researchers report that the sea ice is becoming significantly thinner and more vulnerable.\nLast month, the annual thaw of the region's floating ice reached the lowest level since satellite monitoring began, more than 30 years ago.\nIt is thought the scale of the decline may even affect Europe's weather.\nThe melt is set to continue for at least another week - the peak is usually reached in mid-September - while temperatures here remain above freezing.\nThe Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) is at the forefront of Arctic research and its international director, Kim Holmen, told the BBC that the speed of the melting was faster than expected.\n\"It is a greater change than we could even imagine 20 years ago, even 10 years ago,\" Dr Holmen said.\n\"And it has taken us by surprise and we must adjust our understanding of the system and we must adjust our science and we must adjust our feelings for the nature around us.\"\nThe institute has been deploying its icebreaker, Lance, to research conditions between Svalbard and Greenland - the main route through which ice flows out of the Arctic Ocean.\nDuring a visit to the port, one of the scientists involved, Dr Edmond Hansen, told me he was \"amazed\" at the size and speed of this year's melt.\n\"As a scientist, I know that this is unprecedented in at least as much as 1,500 years. It is truly amazing - it is a huge dramatic change in the system,\" Dr Hansen said.\n\"This is not some short-lived phenomenon - this is an ongoing trend. You lose more and more ice and it is accelerating - you can just look at the graphs, the observations, and you can see what's happening.\"\nI interviewed Dr Hansen while the Lance was docked at Norway's Arctic research station at Ny-Alesund on Svalbard.\nKey data on the ice comes from satellites but also from measurements made by a range of different techniques - a mix of old and new technology harnessed to help answer the key environmental questions of our age.\nThe Norwegians send teams out on to the floating ice to drill holes into it and extract cores to determine the ice's origin.\nAnd since the early 90s they have installed specialist buoys, tethered to the seabed, which use sonar to provide a near-constant stream of data about the ice above.\nAn electro-magnetic device known as an EM-Bird has also been flown, suspended beneath a helicopter, in long sweeps over the ice.\nThe torpedo-shaped instrument gathers data about the difference between the level of the seawater beneath the ice and the surface of the ice itself.\nBy flying transects over the ice, a picture of its thickness emerges. The latest data is still being processed but one of the institute's sea ice specialists, Dr Sebastian Gerland, said that though conditions vary year by year a pattern is clear.\n\"In the region where we work we can see a general trend to thinner ice - in the Fram Strait and at some coastal stations.\"\nWhere the ice vanishes entirely, the surface loses its usual highly reflective whiteness - which sends most solar radiation back into space - and is replaced by darker waters instead which absorb more heat.\nAccording to Dr Gerland, additional warming can take place even if ice remains in a far thinner state.\n\"It means there is more light penetrating through the ice - that depends to a high degree on the snow cover but once it has melted the light can get through,\" Dr Gerland said.\n\"If the ice is thinner there is more light penetrating and that light can heat the water.\"\nThe most cautious forecasts say that the Arctic might become ice-free in the summer by the 2080s or 2090s. But recently many estimates for that scenario have been brought forward.\nEarly research investigating the implications suggests that a massive reduction in sea ice is likely to have an impact on the path of the jet stream, the high-altitude wind that guides weather systems, including storms.\nThe course and speed of the jet stream is governed by the difference in temperature between the Tropics and the Arctic, so a change on the scale being observed now could be felt across Europe and beyond.\nKim Holmen of the NPI explained how the connection might work.\n\"When the Arctic is ice free, it is not white any more and it will absorb more sunlight and that change will influence wind systems and where the precipitation comes.\n\"For northern Europe it could mean much more precipitation, while southern Europe will become drier so there are large scale shifts across the entire continent.\"\nThat assessment is mirrored by work at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting, based in the British town of Reading.\nThe centre's director-general, Alan Thorpe, said the link between the Arctic melt and European weather was complicated but it is now the subject of research.\n\"Where Arctic sea ice is reducing in summer - and if we have warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the north-west Atlantic - these twin factors together lead to storms being steered over the UK in summer which is not the normal situation and leads to our poorer summers.\"\nBut the research is in its earliest stages. For science, the Arctic itself is hard to decipher. The effects of its rapid melt are even tougher.\nYou can see David's coverage from the Arctic on BBC News on Friday - on television, on radio and online.

The $20bn deal was the biggest foreign acquisition by a Japanese firm at the time.\nThe new deal will be funded by Softbank's own cash reserves and a long term loan from Japan's Mizuho Bank.\nIt's hard to exaggerate just how important ARM is to the UK tech sector - and the shock many are feeling this morning at the news that it is about to lose its independence.\nIts brilliance was to realise that if chips were about to come with everything, you didn't have to make them - designing them was the key.\nFive years ago, Cambridge was home to at least three world-beating UK-owned technology firms, ARM, Autonomy and Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR).\nThen Autonomy was swallowed up by HP in an ill-fated deal, last year the chipmaker Qualcomm bought CSR, and now the biggest and best, ARM, is about to have a Japanese owner.\nAnd in Softbank, ARM may well have found a good parent.\nThe Japanese firm bought France's Aldebaran robotics business and has gone on to give it a global profile.\nBut there will still be sadness this morning in Cambridge, and beyond, that Britain's best hope of building a global technology giant now appears to have gone.\nSoftbank-ARM deal is a bet on the future\nSoftbank intends to preserve the UK tech firm's organisation, including its existing senior management structure and partnership-based  business model, ARM said.\nMasayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive of Softbank, said: \"This is one of the most important acquisitions we have ever made, and I expect ARM to be a key pillar of SoftBank's growth strategy going forward.\nHowever, the co-founder of ARM Hermann Hauser said: \"This is a sad day for me and a sad day for technology in Britain.\"\n\"ARM is the last British [technology] company that has a global reach,\" he said.\n\"It gave Britain real strength. It was a British company that determined the next generation microprocessor architecture.\"\nARM Holdings is arguably the most precious jewel in the crown of British technology, its microchip designs are used in billions of devices.\nSources close to the deal say the Japanese company considers ARM well placed to exploit the so called \"internet of things\" which may see microchips embedded in whole new categories of household and business devices.\nPrime Minister Theresa May recently questioned whether foreign takeovers of UK firms are always in the national interest. However, Softbank has committed to doubling the size of ARM's UK-based workforce over the next five years and new Chancellor Philip Hammond welcomed the deal.\nThat allure has been boosted by the fall in the value of the pound since Brexit - making UK targets cheaper and many industry watchers are predicting a new wave of foreign takeovers.\nARM has until recently argued that its future was better served as an independent company. However, Stuart Chambers, ARM chairman since March 2014, is no stranger to making it big in Japan. He was responsible for selling Pilkington, another blue chip UK company, to Nippon Sheet Glass in 2006.\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the deal between Softbank and ARM Holdings showed the UK economy could be successful after the country voted to leave the European Union.\nA spokeswoman for the prime minister said Mrs May believed the deal was in the country's national interest - a gauge that she will use to assess any future foreign takeovers.\n\"This is good news for British workers, it's good news for the British economy, it shows that, as the prime minister has been saying, we can make a success of leaving the EU,\" the spokeswoman added.\nDan Ridsdale, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said \"An increase in inbound merger and acquisition activity was one of the obvious consequences of Brexit and weakened sterling, but few expected it to manifest itself so quickly or at so large a scale.\"\nFormer Business Secretary Vince Cable told the BBC there was usually very little the government could do to prevent takeovers.\n\"We don't have a system of defence against takeovers if they prove to be unsatisfactory,\" he said.\nMr Cable added the government had few legal powers to stop takeovers unless it could be demonstrated there was a national security issue.", "summary": "UK technology firm ARM Holdings is to be bought by Japan's Softbank for \u00a324bn ($32bn) it confirmed on Monday."}

Candidates must be aged 23 or over and have held Tunisian nationality for at least 10 years.\nAccording to ISIE, 49% of newly-registered voters are women. And the 26 January 2014 constitution introduced - for the first time in the Arab world - parity between men and women in elections.\nThe law stipulates that women should comprise 50% of all electoral lists and there must be an equal number of lists headed by women and men.\nTunisian women take a 'step backwards'\nTunisia's election process means that no party is likely to win a majority of seats in the renamed National Assembly. However, political observers agree - in the absence of opinion polls, which are banned during the campaign - that the favourites are the Islamist Ennahda Movement and their secular opponents, the liberal Nidaa Tounes (Tunisia's Call).\nA number of other parties are in contention, including the centre-ground secular Congress for the Republic (CPR) and secular Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberty (FDTL or Ettakatol) and those led by former officials of Ben Ali's regime.\nMost candidates claim to have the economy at the heart of their campaign, realising that poverty and unemployment were the main factors that triggered the 14 January revolution in 2011.\nEnnahda won 89 of 217 seats in 2011 and led a coalition government with CPR and FDTL. It lost power in January following street protests but hopes to make a comeback. It has said it is willing to form a coalition with any other party.\nNidaa Tounes wants to rally nationalist and liberal supporters to weaken the position of Ennahda. It was founded by Beji Caid Essebsi, a former transitional prime minister, and enjoys the support of the Tunisian General Labour Union and some business groups. Nidaa says it will not contemplate any coalition with Ennahda until that groups \"clarifies\" its relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East and North Africa.\nCongress for the Republic (CPR) is led by interim President Marzouki and won 29 seats in 2011.\nDemocratic Forum for Labour and Liberties was founded in 1994 by National Constituent Assembly Speaker Mustapha Ben Djaafar. It won 20 seats in 2011.\nPopular Front is a coalition of five left-wing and Baathist parties led by Hamma Hammami. It played an important role in mobilising street protests to bring down two Ennahda-led governments. The Front parties, however, do not seem to have significant electoral support.\nThe al-Qaeda-affiliated Okba Ibn Nafaa battalion, active on Tunisia's border with Algeria, has threatened to disrupt the election.\nInterior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou has said his ministry has plans in hand to deal with the \"terrorist\" threat, which he described as \"serious\". Tunisia is to mobilize 50,000 security officers and nearly 20,000 soldiers to secure the election.\nTunisians have shown only \"lukewarm interest\", according to al-Jazeera TV on 20 October. Tunisian academic Abdellatif Hanachi told al-Jazeera that this is partly because of the difficult economic and social conditions in the country.\nHe added that voter apathy was due to a \"sense of frustration\" among a broad section of people at the failure to fulfil revolutionary promises.

{"id": "40029092", "article": "Mr King is not the rather better-known writer of horror novels (though his robust opinions on the dangers of monetary largesse can tend towards sleepless nights).\nThis Mr King is senior economic adviser at HSBC. And a China expert.\nWriting about the country's economic slowdown in 2012, he said: \"China's debt fuelled expansion was never likely to be sustainable.\"\nThe amber warning lights came back on this morning when the ratings agency Moody's downgraded China's credit rating, its investor benchmark for analysing the country's economic performance.\nNow, the rating is still A1 - the agency's fifth highest - but nevertheless does highlight growing concerns about the amount of debt the world's most populous country is carrying.\nThe problem is not the government's direct debt, which at less than 40% of GDP is modest by Western standards, or the eminently manageable 3% deficit (the rate at which that debt is rising).\nThe issue is the debt being carried by the country's companies, or more specifically the \"state-owned enterprises\" (SOEs) that constitute the grumbling and sometimes out-of-date engines of the Chinese economy.\nAnd the debts being carried by the country's local governments - which, of course, in a state the size of China, are a little more significant than those of an English town council, say.\nHere, the picture is different.\nSOE debt stands at 115% of GDP, a figure that is steadily rising and is far higher than, say, comparable figures for Japan and South Korea (where comparable debts are around 30%).\nMoody's estimates that bringing the leverage of those firms down to more manageable levels would cost more than $400bn (\u00a3308bn).\nAt the same time, China's own finance ministry has warned that some local authorities are struggling to meet day-to-day operating costs, as they find themselves caught between supporting often inefficient local businesses - making steel, for example - or funding the unpaid debts and unemployment costs associated with shutting down or reforming the mainstays of regional economies.\nNow, China certainly has deep pockets.\nIts foreign currency reserves stand at more than $3tn and its annual current account surplus is $200bn.\nSo, debt sustainability is not a near and present danger.\nBut, if the old joke is that when America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold, when it comes to China, it only has to think about reaching for its handkerchief and the global economy can suffer a fit of the vapours.\nWhen China announced weaker-than-expected economic data at the beginning of 2016, world stock markets went into free fall and commodity prices tumbled.\nIn 2010, average Chinese growth hovered around 10%. It is now between 6% and 7%.\nMore manageable than the heady days of seven years ago, yes, but there are fears that a lack of economic reform could see growth fall to 5% as President Xi Jinping balances the drive for a more efficient economy (with all the dislocating restructuring costs and possible job losses that could incur) with the need to keep political tension to a minimum.\nIn a jittery world, China's debt mountain can loom larger than the fundamentals suggest.\nAnd Moody's downgrade is just one straw in the wind.\nAsian stock markets hardly paused for breath when it was announced earlier this morning and warnings of a \"hard landing\" for the Chinese economy have been oft-predicted and not materialised.\nBut, Chinese bond yields are rising as investors demand a higher risk premium for funding the government's liabilities.\nThere is no need to rush for the lifeboats yet.\nHowever, it's probably worth knowing where they are.", "summary": "In his new book Grave New World, Stephen King says: \"For better or worse, China is simply too big to be ignored.\""}

I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\"\nIt led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.\nColdplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce.\nShe only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.\nSome of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.\nThe performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.\nYou can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.\nShe raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.\nFor the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.\n1987's show was altogether more bizarre.\nA magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.\nAt the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.\nIt was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.\nShe arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\".\nHe was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves.\nIt quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.\nAnd when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend.\nPoor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.\nFew ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).\nNonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.\nBut there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online.\nIn response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content.

It will end when he walks through the front door of the family home in Lisburn, Belfast for Christmas, having lived through an incredible time in modern history.\nVery few 29-year-olds have managed a national football team. None have done it while that country is being brought to its knees by Ebola. \"I'm very sad, very emotional,\" he said.\n\"Saying goodbye to Sierra Leone was very emotional, very difficult. I don't keep my distance from things; I invest emotionally. The country has become part of me.\"\nHaving been an academy coach with the New York Red Bulls, McKinstry was appointed technical director of the Craig Bellamy academy in Sierra Leone at the age of 24.\nBy 27, he was manager of the national team. Within 18 months his squad were in the top 50 of the world rankings for the first time. \"I've made a career of proving doubters wrong,\" he said.\nTwo months ago he was sacked by email, as the Ebola outbreak gathered momentum.\n\"We believed we had the chemistry, cohesion and spirit to achieve anything. But the Ebola outbreak changed everything. Circumstances meant that, in the end, it was an impossible job.\"\nMcKinstry stepped off a plane four hours before we met in a London hotel. He had not slept for the best part of two days.\nThe journey to Freetown Airport had to be made by boat to avoid some of the areas worst affected by Ebola. An early flight meant crossing the night before.\nA night at an airport, one plane to Morocco, another to London followed by a medical check by customs officers is no ordinary preparation for an interview. But for a man who has spent much of the past six months living in lockdown, being among the bustle again is a welcome change.\nHis time in Sierra Leone has now come to an end. The memory of it will, however, live on.\n\"In the last month or so when I went into Freetown for supplies, I started to see more of the Ebola response teams, with the full yellow bio-hazard suits,\" he said. \"You might see an ambulance driving past and even the driver would be in the full bio-hazard gear.\n\"When you see that it really does bring it home to you just how serious the situation is.\"\nMcKinstry was offered a way out, a safe passage home in July, but refused it. Many of the players in the academy were from affected areas, he felt he had a duty of care not to walk away and send the young footballers into danger.\nInstead he quarantined the academy behind the gate and walls of the compound. \"When the outbreak started a lot of people ran for cover,\" he said.\n\"But Ebola is a disease of contact, if you remove the contact, you remove the risk. So that is what we did. We moved everyone who was off site, behind the walls. We had generators for power, bore holes for fresh water, we had dorm rooms, classrooms and a football pitch.\"\nIn Northern Ireland his family were growing increasingly worried about the situation. Did they want him home? \"They wanted information. They wanted to know what was going on, to know that I was safe, that the boys at the academy were safe,\" he said.\nIt is not sensationalist to suggest that the Ebola virus cost McKinstry his job as head coach. But before he explained how it came to an end, he addressed the question of how it all began.\n\"When it comes to football, confidence has not been something I have been lacking,\" McKinstry said with a smile. \"There is a saying in Newcastle - 'shy bearns get nowt' - if you don't ask you don't get.\n\"That was my attitude to the Sierra Leone job. I know I was 27 but if they said no, nothing is lost. If they said yes, it was going to be the start of an exciting new chapter.\"\nMcKinstry had watched every Sierra Leone home game in person, every away game on TV, he had watched them train, studied their players. \"I thought I was the best man for the job,\" he added. \"I got in the room with the decision-makers and I went through Sierra Leone's last two games with a fine tooth comb and Tunisia's last two, who would be our next opponents.\n\"I outlined how I'd beat Tunisia, how I saw the future. Every member of the panel went away with a dossier, which I told them they could keep and use even if they didn't choose me.\n\"Two days later they offered me the job.\"\nMcKinstry made an impressive start, losing just one of his first six matches and leading Sierra Leone into the top 50 of Fifa's world rankings, above Northern Ireland, the Republic, Cameroon and Senegal. Then the Ebola outbreak happened and football became a side issue.\n\"We looked at what little we could do as sporting heroes, could we put smiles on the faces of the nation?\" McKinstry said. \"Football is a second religion in Sierra Leone.\n\"So when the national team wins, the national psyche is buoyed, everyone walks an inch or two taller. We made a commitment to keep on winning to try to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations so that people in the country would feel a little bit better. Unfortunately it wasn't to work out that way.\"\nThe Confederation of African Football ruled that Sierra Leone could not play games at home. A challenging task was becoming a near-impossible one. \"In football, the home team tends to win 50% of the time. In Africa, the home team wins 65 or 70% of the time,\" McKinstry explained.\nThat was not the only complication. \"In my final game, against DR Congo, we had 17,000 fans just chanting 'Ebola, Ebola, Ebola' at us. It was upsetting for our players. The atmosphere was difficult. It made the players angry that people were mocking the situation in their homeland,\" he said.\nSierra Leone players found opponents unwilling to shake hands, hotels unwilling to check them in and governments uncertain on granting them entry. \"People fear things they don't know,\" he said. \"Hotel arrangements were monitored wherever we went, there were daily medical checks for my players and, while that is not overly difficult, it can impact on players' mental state.\"\nSierra Leone's first group game as they attempted to qualify for the African Cup of Nations was away to Ivory Coast in early September.\nWith a week to go, McKinstry was still unsure whether he and his players would be allowed into the country. The confusion meant some players had to buy their own plane tickets. Others arrived the night before the game.\nSierra Leone led for an hour, only to lose 2-1. The demands of their schedule meant the squad left at 11pm that night to fly to DR Congo for a 'home' qualifier that was to be played in the away team's stadium. That game too ended in a 2-0 defeat and was marred by chants of 'Ebola, Ebola.'\nMcKinstry did not see the end coming. He said: \"I had been in the FA building that day and not once was anything mentioned. I was driving back home, over a mountain pass, when my phone buzzed with an email from one of the men I'd been speaking to, not two hours earlier. It said they had terminated my contract. I was disappointed. I'd been standing in their office a few hours earlier.\n\"But I believe in a certain way of doing things. So I spun the car around, went straight back to the FA, not to argue with them but just to go in shake hands and say 'best of luck for the future and it has been a pleasure for the past 18 months.'\"\nMcKinstry has a voracious appetite for football and for learning, he lives and breathes it and his sense of adventure means predicting his next move is not easy.\nIn the New Year he has a series of meetings in Asia. This is not a man who does things by the book. Having been a coach from the age of 15, McKinstry already has miles on the clock.\nThe boyhood Newcastle United fan still dreams of taking charge at St James' Park or leading his native Northern Ireland out. \"Nothing would make me prouder, my heart would be beating out of my chest for both those opportunities at some stage in my career.\"\nWatch the full interview with Johnny McKinstry - Football Focus, BBC One on Saturday 20 December at 12:10 GMT.", "summary": "Johnny McKinstry is on the final leg of a remarkable journey."}

{"id": "40464201", "article": "In articulating why the tournament needed a dramatic overhaul, Dodson spoke about \"bleak prospects\" and \"perfect storms\" if everything stayed the same. Browne went even further when pointing out a \"potentially profound\" risk to the professional game in Ireland if the Pro12 didn't get its act together.\nIt was all about money. The Pro12 brings in about \u00a312m in television revenues - a relative spit in a bucket compared to the riches of the Premiership in England and the Top 14 in France.\nThe unions in Scotland, Ireland and Wales were all beside themselves with worry over the yawning financial disadvantage they were at compared to the English and the French as they attempted to keep hold of their marquee players.\nIn exploring the possibility of inviting two American franchises into the Pro12 in time for the 2018-19 season, Dodson spoke of the necessity to tap into new markets and find new money in order to fight off English and French clubs who may come looking for Scotland's finest. \"To stay as we are is not an option,\" he said.\nThings have changed. It's not the Americans who are in the frame now, it's the South Africans. And 2018-19 is not on the table anymore, it's 2017-18. It's the coming season, which begins in September.\nOn 7 July - this coming Friday - the South African Rugby Union will go through the Pro12's list of requirements for acceptance of two of their franchises - the Cheetahs from Bloemfontein and the Kings from Port Elizabeth - into the next Pro12 campaign.\nThey will have to make commitments on finance - each of the current 12 clubs from Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales could be in line for an extra \u00a3500,000-\u00a3800,000 in revenues from the South African union and South African television - as well as commitments on squad enhancement. The last thing the Pro12 needs is two more also-rans.\nThe Cheetahs and the Kings are the poor relations of South African rugby. Of the six SARU franchises in Super Rugby, they are the weakest. They sit in their usual perch at the tail-end of the southern hemisphere club competition, a combined eight wins from 27 games this season and six wins from 30 games last season. Of the 27 players used by the Springboks in their 3-0 series win over the French this month, only two came from the Cheetahs and none at all from the Kings.\nSuper Rugby is a failing competition, the expansion to 18 teams - to include sides from Japan and Argentina in addition to those from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - has proved to be a calamity that now needs unravelling. The crowds are falling, the television audience is collapsing, there are too many teams in a bloated league format that is confusing and unloved.\nThree teams will be culled at the end of the current season - the Cheetahs and the Kings are two of them. SARU could have killed off the pair of them or they could have rolled them into their four other franchises, but then the Pro12 option struck and now, according to sources close to the negotiations, this deal is 75% likely to happen in time for the coming season.\nAlready, behind the scenes, a provisional format for a new Pro14 is being put together. There are different scenarios but the most probable is that the 14 teams are split into two divisions of seven - two Irish, two Welsh, one Scottish, one Italian and one South African.\nThey'd play home and away - 12 games. All the regular local derbies would exist on top of that. Instead of two rounds of the 1872 Cup between Glasgow and Edinburgh there would be three. Play-offs would continue and fewer games would be played in international windows.\nThat's if SARU deliver the goods on Friday and everything goes smoothly thereafter. Don't discount a spanner in the works, but there is mounting confidence in this going through.\nIf it does, then the already rapid pace of change will go up another gear as the various unions attempt to sell this to their supporters, and their various commercial and logistical arms attempt to put plans in place. There's a fixture schedule to be organised, there are arrangements to be made over playing the South Africans in South Africa and having the South Africans playing in Europe.\nThe Pro12 already has too many uncompetitive teams and one of the pre-requisites of the deal would be that the decidedly underwhelming Cheetahs - who average just less than 8,000 fans per home game in a stadium that holds 48,000 - and the flops that are the Kings - who bring in just 7,000 per game in a ground that holds almost 49,000 - would be beefed-up by transplanted Springboks.\nQuite how SARU are going to remove talents from the Stormers, the Bulls, the Sharks and the Lions without there being an uprising in Cape Town, Pretoria, Durban and Johannesburg is anybody's guess. That's what they will need to sign up to, though. There's potentially a mountainous in-tray and precious little time to get through it. If Friday happens the way Pro12 officials think it may, they'd have eight weeks until the new league is supposed to start.\nThere is a surreal air to all of this. Supporters of the Pro12 clubs haven't really engaged with this story yet, partly, one suspects, because the British and Irish Lions are preoccupying their thoughts and, partly again, because they probably think this is just a flyer, a silly season story for the summer, a bottle of smoke.\nIt's hard to get your head around. The wrong kind of expansionism - plans are still afoot to bring in an American franchise next summer - has brought Super Rugby to a dark place. Why follow them?\nHow can you shoe-horn in, at eye-watering speed, two disparate South African franchises and expect to be taken seriously as a league? How can supporters buy into a competition that looks like a dog's dinner? The Pro12 knows that in terms of PR they have an Everest to climb. In their slippers. Going backwards. In a blindfold.\nThere's also the bottom line that Dodson and Browne and others have spoken about. As it is, the Pro12 is not doing it for them as a commercial entity. To sit on their hands and do nothing but moan about their lack of cash and their vulnerability to rich owners in England and France achieves nothing.\nThe Pro12 needs a radical shake-up, it's true. This would be radical, no doubt about it. A year ago, Dodson and Browne said they wouldn't be hanging about, that the time for action was now. Usually you take that stuff with a pinch of salt. For some, as they digest this, it'll be a shot of brandy that'll be required.", "summary": "It was back in August last year that Mark Dodson, chief executive of Scottish Rugby, and Philip Browne, his counterpart in the Irish Rugby Football Union, truly raised the alarm about the Pro12."}

{"id": "21938080", "article": "The pair stood accused of committing manslaughter and sexual violence against the exchange student. They were convicted in 2009, but acquitted two years later.\nThe acquittal was overturned and a subsequent appeal ruling in January 2014 saw Mr Sollecito again found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in jail.\nBut in March 2015, Italy's highest court overturned that decision - the final ruling.\nLast year, the police found Mr Sollecito near the Italian border and confiscated his passport. He remained free while awaiting the Supreme Court's decision.\nAmanda Knox, residing in the US, also had her conviction overturned. She had been sentenced to 28 years and six months.\nFrom the start of the highly publicised case, Ms Knox - who lived with Ms Kercher - became the primary focus of media attention, leaving Mr Sollecito a somewhat shadowy figure in the background.\n\"Even though Amanda and I shared the same unjust fate, the case was always about her,\" the Italian wrote in his 2012 memoir Honor Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox.\n\"I vanished so far from public view that I thought of myself\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 as Mr Nobody.\"\nThe book was released after the former couple's acquittal and thrust Sollecito into the limelight for the first time.\nIn it, he describes how he refused to cave in to pressure from his family to testify against his then girlfriend. He said his main aim had been to \"save\" Amanda from finishing her days in prison.\n\"If I had changed my testimony, Amanda would have remained behind bars for the rest of her life, not just the 26 years to which she was originally sentenced. And that was something my conscience could never permit.\"\nThe son of a successful urologist, Raffaele Sollecito was born on 26 March 1984 in the southern Italian city of Giovinazzo.\nHe was on the verge of completing a computer science degree at Perugia University when he met Amanda Knox, an exchange student from Seattle, at a classical music concert in October 2007. Their encounter took place just days before Ms Kercher's death.\n\"It was a really nice relationship,\" he said in an interview.\n\"In that period she was much more at my apartment than in her one. It was an intense story, it was the start. It was crazy.\"\nIt was the same flat - bought for Mr Sollecito by his parents - where Ms Knox claimed she spent the night when Ms Kercher was murdered. This contradicted reports of her initial police statement, which originally placed her at the scene of the crime.\nMr Sollecito's defence was that on the night of the murder he was at home surfing the internet - although police said his computer records did not support the alibi.\nHe has also admitted smoking marijuana at the time. Both Mr Sollecito and Ms Knox admitted a fondness for the drug - which they blamed for their inability to recall their movements on the night Ms Kercher died.\nIn a letter to an Italian magazine he wrote: \"One morning you return to her house and find a big mess. The problems begin: the police arrive, break down the locked door to a bedroom and discover the lifeless body of one of her (Amanda's) friends. From then on they suspect everyone and everything.\"\nThe pair's defence was not helped by CCTV evidence leaked to the Italian press, reportedly showing them buying erotic lingerie and discussing \"wild sex\" barely 24 hours after Ms Kercher's death.\nMr Sollecito's DNA was found on Ms Kercher's bra clasp.\nIn the end, the jury sided with the prosecution and found them both guilty. Mr Sollecito's impassive face provided a stark contrast to Ms Knox who broke down in tears in the courtroom.\nSent to separate prisons, Mr Sollecito later said of Ms Knox that her image continued to conjure up \"the image of a nightmare\".\nIn letters from his cell, he wrote: \"The Amanda I know... lives a carefree life. Her only thought is the pursuit of pleasure.\"\n\"But,\" he added, \"even the thought that she could be a killer is impossible for me.\"\nThe pair spent four years in jail before their conviction was overturned in October 2011 on the grounds that DNA evidence was flawed.\nAppearing on US talk shows, Mr Sollecito revealed that he still shared \"a really strong bond\" with Ms Knox, whom he had visited in Seattle a few months after their release.\n\"After she hugged me, I realised that Amanda is the Amanda that I dated for that week. She's not the Amanda that was the ghost Amanda during those four years,\" he said in an interview with ABC.\nWhen asked if they were still dating, he replied: \"No, no - she's with another boyfriend and I am going on with my life. We are really good friends now but no, no there is nothing between us now.\"\nIn July last year he distanced his legal case from hers saying that Ms Knox was not present in his house at the time of Ms Kercher's murder as she has claimed.\nThe BBC's Ruth Alexander met Mr Sollecito in Perugia in August last year and said although he sounded exasperated at times over the accusations made against him, he only rebuffed questions about Amanda Knox.\n\"I really don't want to make any comment or be a defence team for her,\" he said.", "summary": "Raffaele Sollecito was 23 and about to finish his degree when he was arrested along with then-girlfriend Amanda Knox for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Italy."}

{"id": "40244905", "article": "In 2015, voter turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds was estimated to be 43%, compared with a 66.1% turnout overall. This year, YouGov puts the youth turnout at 58%.\nPolling traditionally shows that a majority of young people vote Labour.  This year, the proportion has jumped to 63% for 18-29-year-olds, according to YouGov.\nSo how did this change happen?\nSam Jeffers, co-founder of Who Targets Me, which monitored the use of social media adverts by the political parties during the general election, said it seemed clear that Labour defeated the Conservatives in the social media battle.\nLabour's adverts had consistently been shared more widely by social media users, he said.\nPart of this appears to be down to the difference in tone of the adverts.\nWhile the Conservatives had almost entirely focused their adverts on the strength of Prime Minister Theresa May and the weakness of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Labour's social media adverts had been more positive, seeking to emphasise that the party was building a social movement, he said.\nAnd this had been combined with the repeated use of adverts with practical messages designed to increase youth voter turnout by giving instructions on how to register to vote and where to find local polling stations.\nAdverts also appeared to have been released on specific days on the basis that their message was likely to cut through for only a limited amount of time, Mr Jeffers said.\nFor example, Labour had invested heavily on adverts attacking the Tories' so-called \"dementia tax\" on social care costs, days before the 8 June election.\nThe aim of this appeared to be to suppress the older, potentially Conservative, vote or get them to switch to Labour at the last minute, Mr Jeffers said.\nLabour also focused its attention on more of the UK, targeting 464 constituencies in the final two days of the election campaign. The Tories targeted 205.\nWas it Facebook wot swung it?\nWhile the Labour Party paid for targeted adverts on social media, Momentum - the group that was set up to support Mr Corbyn's leadership bid and now campaigns for Labour - had a different social media strategy.\nRather than pay for advertising, it instead sought to create content it hoped social media users would share voluntarily.\nThe group created videos - many of them parodies - it hoped would become viral.\nThese included Daddy, why do you hate me? - a mock political broadcast telling people to vote for Theresa May \"because your children deserve worse\" - which Momentum says has been viewed more than 7.6 million times across social media platforms.\nIts Facebook and Twitter pages feature a mixture of content, from posts mocking Theresa May's record to videos of Mr Corbyn hugging some of his supporters.\nJoe Todd, from Momentum, said the group had felt its strategy was working when it had realised many of the people sharing its content were not typical supporters of Mr Corbyn.\nIncreasingly, users liking its Facebook page had been people who also liked the pages of TV programmes not known for their political audiences, such as Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and Match of the Day, he said.\n\"We were breaking out of the leftie bubble,\" Mr Todd said.\nUsing message services to reach the young - and in some cases mobilising them into an army of potential canvassers - had been important in reaching the youth vote, Mr Todd said.\nMomentum says it reached some 400,000 people through the messaging platform WhatsApp, which data shows is used most by 18-to 29-year-olds, in the UK.\nThe group also set up mynearestmarginal.com - a website that enables activists to pool together, and often lift share, to canvass in marginal seats.\nMomentum says the website was used by about 100,000 people - more than four times as many as its 24,000 membership.\nThis meant young people with no experience of canvassing could team up with those with previous election experience for targeted canvassing.\n\"If you have a young person telling another young person, 'You should get out and vote because this election is important', it's more convincing,\" Mr Todd said.\nThere was also an unashamed pitch for the youth vote at the heart of Labour's manifesto For the Many, Not the Few - and that was the eye-catching promise of scrapping tuition fees for university students and the pledge to reintroduce their maintenance grants.\nFurther policies pitched with the young in mind included the ending of zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships, a rise in the minimum wage, and a pledge to build more than one million homes.\nOf course, Labour wasn't the only party that targeted young people and it's hard to quantify the effect of the manifesto in getting the young out to vote, but Mr Todd felt it was among the most significant factors.\n\"It conjured up a sense of hope,\" he said.\nThe Labour campaign also featured large rallies that accompanied Jeremy Corbyn's speeches around the country.\nMr Corbyn had been a long-standing supporter of the protest movement, and the veteran anti-war campaigner was well placed to appeal to a growing number of young people who had become engaged in politics through these movements, according to Sam Fairbairn, national secretary of the People's Assembly protest group.\nAlthough the People's Assembly does not endorse individual parties or candidates, Mr Fairbairn said the group - and its numerous local affiliates and sister organisations - had encouraged members to join Mr Corbyn's campaign rallies.\n\"It's no accident Jeremy has been part of these movements since he's been in politics. This is how many young people have got into politics in the last 10 years,\" Mr Fairbairn said.\n\"What we saw was the result of the work all these movements have done.\"\nA string of endorsements from anti-establishment celebrities and musicians, including from the world of grime - a genre of music that blends garage and jungle and  has a Jamaican influence - also, arguably, further bolstered Mr Corbyn's youth credentials.\nMr Corbyn also took part in interviews with outlets - such as rock magazines NME and Kerrang, and football YouTube channel Copa90 - outside of the political mainstream that were more likely to reach younger audiences.\nBecka Hudson, from the #Grime4Corbyn campaign, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Mr Corbyn had \"offered young people a programme they can believe in and a better future\".\nThe question is what happens next with that youth support.\nIs there the danger the young will be discouraged by the election result and be less likely to turn out at the next election, whenever that may be?\nMr Todd thinks the opposite is the case.\n\"For most people this project was something they believed in, but it seemed like it might not be possible. Now the prospect of victory is really realistic,\" he said.", "summary": "A boosted youth vote is believed to have contributed to Labour's shock election result, but what made young people turn out to vote?"}

Or just carry on as we were?\"\nMr Hammond is attending his first meeting as chancellor with the G20 finance ministers which is taking place in Chengdu. He will also visit Beijing and Hong Kong.\nHe declared that Britain was \"open for business\" and was \"one of the most attractive destinations in the world for international investment\".\nBefore Britain voted to leave the EU, China's Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said the consequences were unclear, but that they would be felt for years to come.\nMr Lou said Brexit would \"cast a shadow over the global economy\" and that the \"repercussions and fallout\" would emerge over the next five to 10 years.", "summary": "The new Chancellor of the Exchequer has said he may use the Autumn Statement to \"reset\" Britain's economic policy."}

{"id": "33567564", "article": "If you were sold PPI via your credit card then the differences can amount to thousands of pounds.\nThis is because of the way some credit card providers interpret the regulatory guidelines.\n\"It's becoming a bit of a lottery,\" personal finance expert Jonquil Lowe told BBC Radio 4's Moneybox programme.\n\"The amount of redress you get depends on which provider you happen to have your credit card with,\" said Ms Lowe, who is a lecturer in personal finance at the Open University.\nThese differences emerged last year when Martin Baker, managing director of the Swindon-based claims management company Renaissance Easy Claim, began challenging redress offers from MBNA, an American-based credit card provider whose cards are extensively marketed in the UK.\nMr Baker noticed that MBNA's compensation offers to his clients appeared to be significantly lower than he would have expected from the high street banks.\nOne client, Mark Pascoe, was offered \u00a35,800 in compensation by MBNA. Had his card been with a high street bank, Mr Baker estimates he would have received more than \u00a313,000.\nMr Baker now has around 1,000 MBNA compensation clients on his books.\n\"In a sample of our cases,\" Mr Baker told the BBC's Moneybox programme, \"we found 80% were due more if MBNA paid according to the way the high street banks pay.\"\nOn average, MBNA's redress offers amount to around half what high street banks would award on the same credit card history, he said.\nCapital One, another American credit card provider, \"adopts a very similar approach to MBNA, with similar results,\" said Mr Baker.\nSo how do such differences arise?\nWhen compensating for mis-sold PPI, regulators require card providers to put customers back into the financial position they would have been in if they had never had PPI at all.\nEach card provider is free to establish its own methodology for calculating redress, within overall regulatory guidelines.\nA key difference arises when a cardholder occasionally pays off their monthly card balance in full.\nTo calculate the compensation owing, banks have to reconstruct a customer's credit card history, removing mis-sold PPI premiums, fees and charges that premiums triggered - for exceeding a card's credit limit, for example - and any interest charged on those payments.\nWith these PPI charges removed the monthly amounts owing are lower. So when card-holders pay off what was their original monthly balance - they have overpaid according to their reconstructed card history.\nThe differing treatment of such overpayments is a major cause of the differences in compensation offers, argues Martin Baker.\nWhile high street banks treat an overpayment as a temporary credit to be set against future spending on a customer's card - MBNA and Capital One treat it as a permanent loan from the customer to themselves lasting for the lifetime of the card, he says.\nIt may sound a technicality, but it can have a significant impact on compensation.\nBecause while regulators require card providers to pay customers 8% interest on such loans, that's far less than the amount MBNA and Capital One charge customers on their card borrowings.\nMartin Baker describes this as a \"systemic flaw\" in MBNA and Capital One's methodology.\nEarlier this year, the BBC asked regulators if they thought MBNA and Capital One's methodologies fell within the official rules and guidelines.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority told the BBC they did not accept that there was \"a systemic flaw\" in the calculations.\nThe Financial Ombudsman said in the cases they were seeing, \"card providers were fairly compensating consumers, taking into account the FCA's guidance and the Ombudsman's approach\".\nTo work out how two such very different compensation methodologies could both seemingly be deemed acceptable by regulators, Moneybox commissioned an independent review of MBNA's calculations from the Open University's Jonquil Lowe.\nAfter a detailed analysis of MBNA's methodology Ms Lowe found it differed substantially from the regulatory guidance most banks follow. How much difference that makes to compensation, she says, will vary from case to case.\nMs Lowe says regulatory guidelines do allow banks to make assumptions about what customers might have done had they not had PPI on their credit cards which include assumptions about how banks treat overpayments in their card reconstructions.\nBut because these assumptions can have so big an impact on compensation over time, Ms Lowe says they need careful monitoring.\n\"If an alternative method is used, it has to be appropriate and fair, given the individual circumstances of the case.\n\"The onus has to be on MBNA to say why its method is fairer and more appropriate than the method set out by the regulator and used, in most cases, by the Ombudsman.\"\nBoth MBNA and Capital One declined to be interviewed by the BBC, or to say why they claim the assumptions in their calculations are appropriate.\nIn a statement, MBNA said its calculations were developed in line with the FCA's guidance, and based on how the Financial Ombudsman would expect them to look at individual cases.\nOf Jonquil Lowe's conclusions it said: \"Jonquil Lowe's report sets out how she assumes the FOS might deal with MBNA's cases, based on her theoretical interpretation of general guidance. Our aim is to put customers back in the situation they would have been in, had they not taken a PPI product.\"\nCapital One said it assessed every case on its individual circumstances and is in frequent contact with the Financial Ombudsman Service to ensure its calculations were \"fair and accurate\".\nMeanwhile, regulators continue to stress that any customer who is unhappy with a redress offer can always appeal to the Financial Ombudsman for a ruling.\nGiven the complexity of the calculations behind the offers, however, Jonquil Lowe doubts the practicality of that advice.\n\"It took me 80 hours to unravel what was going on [and] I've got a lot of technical expertise.\n\"The average consumer could not, I think, reconstruct their accounts in the way that I have done. Not least because the information they get along with their redress is usually not detailed enough for them to be able to make that kind of check.\n\"It is extremely hard for consumers to know whether they had a fair redress, or not.\"\nWith that in mind, Andrew Tyrie MP, the newly re-elected Chair of the influential House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said: \"We'll actually be keeping a very close eye on this in the weeks and months ahead.\n\"We've been working very hard to get a decent level of address on PPI for a long time and we're certainly not going to let go of the subject until we're satisfied a correct and decent amount of compensation is being paid.\"", "summary": "People who were mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) can receive widely differing compensation, a BBC investigation has found."}

BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about \u00c2\u00a340bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about \u00c2\u00a310bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.\nSenior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off.\nSeparating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.\nCreating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.\nBT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone.

So, we can do different things to the skin - we can put patterns on it, we can change the styling and design. There's quite a lot of flexibility there.\"\nThe 25-year-old inventor intends to charge customers \u00a32,000 for the device, including the cost of a fitting.\nAlthough prosthetic arms fitted with hooks typically can be bought for similar prices, ones with controllable fingers are usually sold for between \u00a320,000 and \u00a360,000.\nThat cost can sometimes be prohibitive for children, who usually need to change their prosthetic once or twice a year to take account of their growth.\nOpen Bionics' hand relies on myoelectric signals, meaning it detects muscle movements via sensors stuck to the owner's skin and uses them to control its grip.\nA single flex of the wearer's muscles opens and closes the fingers, while a double flex changes the shape to form a pinch grip.\nAlthough the user cannot feel what the fingers are touching, sensors built into the digits can tell when they come into contact with an object to limit the pressure they exert.\nThis means owners can pick up objects as fragile as an egg without crushing them.\nHowever, Mr Gibbard acknowledges there are still some limitations to his design.\n\"We're using lower-cost motors than they have in high-end devices, so the overall strength is lower,\" he said.\n\"So, we are testing it with users and household objects and trying to come to a compromise that means it is very affordable and still has enough power to do most of the stuff that people want.\"\nThe UK engineering prize includes a \u00a32,220 reward and the chance to compete for an international title worth $45,000 (\u00a328,600).\nBut, perhaps more valuably, it will also help the project gain wider recognition.\n\"Joel Gibbard is to be congratulated in advancing the availability of functioning prosthetic devices at affordable prices,\" commented Miss Barbara Jemec, founding chair of the British Foundation for International Reconstructive Surgery and Training (BFirst), on learning of the prize.\n\"Amputees, especially in developing countries, such as Sierra Leone where the civil war left many upper limb amputees, need to have access to affordable and durable prosthetics that work.\n\"A working hand can make all the difference between hunger and being able to work and take care of yourself and your family. I shall be following the development with interest.\"\nOpen Bionics started as a bedroom-based crowdfunding project in 2013, which was supported by Bristol Robotics Laboratory.\nSince then the design has been revised 10 times, and the number of separate parts radically reduced.\nMr Gibbard says he can now size up a user in a matter of minutes using a tablet equipped with a special sensor, 3D-print the parts in about 40 hours, and finally fit them together in a further two hours.\n\"The original design was primarily made of different plastic parts that were screwed and bolted together along with off-the-shelf components,\" he recalls.\n\"It took a very long time to build, and because it was all made of plastic it was subject to a lot of weak points where it could break.\n\"The new design is made of thermoplastic elastomer, which is basically a flexible rubbery plastic.\n\"So, we're able to print something in far fewer pieces and then have flexible joints.\n\"That means it's much more robust to impact forces and it requires much less assembly, so there are savings in cost, time and improvements in performance.\"\nWhile the current design only supports patients whose limb loss is limited to their forearms, the ultimate goal is to be able to help those with above-elbow amputations as well.\nThe roboticist is currently based in Los Angeles where his work is being supported by Walt Disney's  Techstars Accelerator mentorship and investment programme.\nAlthough he intends to start a business by selling custom-made robotic hands in the second half of 2016, the project is also \"open source\" - meaning anyone can share and use its designs without charge so long as they in turn share any improvements they make.\nThis is not the first time a James Dyson Award has gone to a robotic appendage.\nIn 2013, the University of Pennsylvania's Titan Arm - an exoskeleton for one arm designed to help people with back injuries - won the top prize.", "summary": "A prototype 3D-printed robotic hand that can be made faster and more cheaply than current alternatives is this year's UK winner of the James Dyson Award."}

Early fears that Irish republican qualms about the city of culture's \"UK\" label would overshadow the year receded once the extraordinary procession of events, such as a musical hot air balloon overflight, a lumi\u00e8re lighting up the city, and the massive fleadh cheoil Irish folk festival got under way.\nWith no general elections to fight, 2013 might have been a year during which relationships between the main Stormont parties eased, enabling the power-sharing executive to make progress on a number of fronts.\nIn reality, the tensions raised by the Belfast union flag dispute prevented any mid-term d\u00e9tente, making it impossible to bridge policy gaps on outstanding issues like welfare reform.\nUnder pressure from the Northern Ireland Office and Downing Street, the first and deputy first ministers did make an ambitious sounding declaration - setting 2023 as their target date for bringing down Belfast's peace walls.\nPeter Robinson and Martin McGuinness also announced plans for new shared education campuses, and schemes intended to bring young Protestants and Catholics together in work placements or summer camps.\nThe payback from London came with confirmation that the G8 summit would take place in Northern Ireland and a package of financial assistance to the executive as they sought to provide prosperity and stability.\nHowever, the big prize Stormont politicians still pursue, the devolution of corporation tax, was not forthcoming as the Treasury chose to delay any decision until after the Scottish independence referendum.\nEven as they announced their 10-year target for bringing down the peace walls, the first and deputy first ministers acknowledged they had not been able to resolve the \"tough issues\": flags, parades and the past. They needed help from a neutral arbiter, so approached the respected former US envoy, Dr Richard Haass.\nBefore Dr Haass had a chance to start work, relations between Northern Ireland's leaders hit a new low.\nDuring the summer, there were renewed tensions over Orange Order and other parades in Belfast, and a Sinn F\u00e9in commemoration for dead republicans in Castlederg, County Tyrone.\nIn a letter from his holiday home in Florida, Mr Robinson put on hold the executive's prestige Maze Peace Centre project. The decision infuriated Mr McGuinness and made for an awkward week in New York as the two politicians lobbied together for fresh investment, trying their best to hide their obvious disagreements.\nFor the Ulster Unionists, the DUP decision to halt the Maze centre was a cause for celebration. They  had campaigned against the centre as a potential \"shrine\" to the IRA, and their leader, Mike Nesbitt, began his annual conference speech with a picture of the Maze behind his podium, just to drive home his tactical victory.\nThe hard line taken by the Ulster Unionists on the Maze followed the loss of two of their most liberal assembly members.\nBasil McCrea and John McCallister opposed their party's decision to support a unionist unity candidate in a Westminster by-election in Mid Ulster in March. Sinn F\u00e9in's Francie Molloy won the election, replacing Mr McGuinness as an abstentionist MP.\nThe articulate duo of McCrea and McCallister formed a new liberal unionist party, called NI21.\nNI21 are new arrivals - the Traditional Unionists have been around a bit longer. 2013 was a good year for the TUV leader Jim Allister, who succeeded in getting his Special Advisers Bill passed.\nPrompted by the outcry over the appointment of a Sinn F\u00e9in adviser convicted for her part in the murder of magistrate's daughter Mary Travers, the bill prevented anyone with such a serious conviction getting a similar job.\nMr Allister also impressed in his cross-examination of the DUP Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland who faced questions about his handling of some Housing Executive contracts.\nBoth the SDLP and the DUP promoted some younger faces during 2013.\nThe DUP replaced its East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson with its Strangford MLA Simon Hamilton at the finance department. Whether Mr Wilson decides to give up his Westminster seat or his Stormont post in 2015 will be an interesting pointer not just to the future of the DUP but also where senior politicians believe the centre of gravity now lies.\nThe SDLP replaced their environment minister Alex Attwood with one of their Foyle MLAs, Mark Durkan, nephew of the party's MP of the same name. The young minister proved his mettle when he withdrew a major planning bill rather than allow the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in to graft on major amendments that he opposed.\nHowever, the most unexpected development, so far as the SDLP was concerned, was not Mr Durkan's promotion, but the dramatic fall from public life of a man widely predicted to be a future party leader.\nWhen the BBC initially questioned Conall McDevitt about using his wife's firm for assembly research, the matter seemed a little local difficulty. But when it emerged that Mr McDevitt had also not disclosed some earnings from a public relations firm at the outset of his career in the assembly, the South Belfast MLA decided he had no option but to quit politics entirely.\nThe economy and traditional green/orange concerns dominated Stormont proceedings. But the politics of health and morality also drew considerable attention.\nHealth Minister Edwin Poots of the DUP faced criticism over plans to close care homes for the elderly. He also found himself centre stage after losing a court case challenging his policy preventing blood donations from gay men.\nThen there was his department's delay in issuing new abortion guidelines - and the legal confusion highlighted by cases of pregnant women having to travel to England for terminations even though they had been advised their baby had no chance of survival.\nThe issue posed challenges not just for Mr Poots but also for the Alliance Justice Minister David Ford, who announced his desire to consult on changes to the abortion law.\nAnother moral matter that involved both Mr Ford and the DUP was human trafficking and prostitution. DUP peer Lord Morrow is keen on introducing a Swedish-style ban on paying for sexual services, but Mr Ford remains unconvinced.\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams might no longer sit in the assembly, but his name continued to feature strongly in Stormont exchanges.\nMany of these concentrated on the conviction of Mr Adams' brother Liam for the rape and abuse of his daughter Aine. Unionist MLAs accused Mr Adams of not doing enough to report his brother's abuse - a claim he strongly denied.\nMr Adams also faced criticism of his alleged involvement in the IRA's abduction and murder of one of the Disappeared, Jean McConville, and his comments about the \"laissez faire\" attitude of two RUC officers whose deaths were investigated by the Smithwick tribunal.\nThe publication of the Smithwick report and the broadcast of a powerful BBC/RTE documentary on the families of the Disappeared served as a reminder of the darkest days of the Troubles.\nThose memories were also on display in their most raw sense as survivors and the relatives of victims marked the 10th anniversaries of the IRA's Shankill bomb and the UFF Greysteel shooting.\nWhen Dr Haass started his work in earnest in September, most commentators believed he and his co-chair Meghan O'Sullivan might make progress on two items on their agenda, flags and parades.\nHowever, dealing with the past seemed too traumatic and too complex. That impression was strengthened by the furore that followed a suggestion from the Attorney General, John Larkin, that Troubles prosecutions should be brought to an end.\nYet as 2013 came to a close, a surprise appeared in store. Stormont politicians remained deadlocked over flag flying. But there seemed to be more agreement on replacing the much criticised Parades Commission and designing an entirely new architecture to deal with the past.\nThe Haass blueprint brought together several different agencies tackling aspects of the past into a single 'Historical Investigations Unit'. Alongside the unit an 'Independent Commission for Information Retrieval' would have the power, when a victims' family gave the go ahead, to offer limited immunity to anyone who came forward with information that might answer the family's questions.\nHowever, despite many gruelling hours of negotiations the US talks team were not able to broker a compromise. Both Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP indicated they would back the Haass proposals but unionists remained concerned about a new code of conduct on parades and the proposed examination of broad themes related to the Troubles such as collusion.\nDr Haass hoped his proposals would eventually gain acceptance, but he boarded his plane home to New York without the New Year's Eve peace deal he must have really wanted to achieve.", "summary": "Attempts to disrupt Belfast city centre bookended 2013."}

{"id": "25550425", "article": "\"I have been asked in my younger years to consider joining, and I just never felt ready or prepared,\" said Ms Seifert, who started working as a model at the age of 14 and later worked as a television presenter.\nBut the moment finally arrived in 2009, after she had finished a nursing degree in New York. At the age of 25 - the limit for most pageants - time was running out.\nMs Seifert trained for over a month at a so-called beauty camp, setting her sights on representing the Philippines at the Miss Universe competition. But she said pageant organisers disqualified her days before the finals over bikini photos published in a men's magazine.\nUndaunted, she decided to take part in another national pageant weeks later. Not only did she win the national Miss Earth title, she went on to compete in the international pageant, where she was crowned runner-up out of 80 competitors from all over the world.\nBeauty pageants have been popular in the Philippines since they were brought to the country by the American colonial government in the first half of the 20th Century, says Jose Wendell Capili, an academic at the University of the Philippines in the capital, Manila.\nOpposition from feminists, if there is any, is muted.\nThe recent successes of candidates in international competitions have heightened interest even further.\nMr Capili, who wrote a book about Philippine pageants, says that as a result, pageants have become more competitive.\n\"In the old days, an untrained candidate may end up winning a title either because she is a great beauty or is someone from a pedigreed family,\" he said. \"These days, there are talent scouts and modelling agencies who actually train some of the girls, months, even years, before the national competition.\"\nOne of the most successful beauty camps is headed by Jonas Gaffud, who is CEO of a large modelling agency, Mercator.\nHe and a teams of mentors field an average of 10 candidates a year. The mentors work for free, and many of the women dominate the national pageants and go on to place well internationally.\nMr Gaffud is credited with helping Megan Young win the first Miss World crown for the Philippines in 2013. His team's beauty queens have also been finalists in every Miss Universe pageant since 2010. Some have also placed in previous Miss World and Miss International finals.\nIn scouting a potential candidate, Mr Gaffud said that height - at least five feet five inches tall (165.1cm) - and \"the beauty of face\" were most important.\nBut training was just as important. He said candidates need to start training at least six months before a competition. This included studying the pageant's cause, learning how to walk on stage, knowing how to do hair and make-up, exercising to tone the physique and practicing how to answer questions, he said.\nMs Seifert, who trained at another beauty camp, said that the hours spent training were intense.\n\"There are different exercises that you do, all the way from head to toe. Stretching, neck rotations, really tough waist movements to shape your waist,\" she said.\nOne exercise was called the \"duck walk\" and involved walking in circles in a bikini at a dance studio lined with mirrors. \"Just imagine doing lunges in high heels with a book or several books on your head - and they cannot fall,\" she said.\nAnd despite her previous experience as a television host, she still received coaching for the pageant Q&A, as well as advice from former pageant winners.\nLike Ms Seifert, Sian Elizabeth Maynard also trained at a beauty camp before taking part in a national pageant, even after successfully winning three local titles.\nShe did calisthenics exercises and walking training, which included \"doing weird lunges and wiggling\".\nSian Elizabeth Maynard, now 27, did not really want to join beauty pageants. But she says her mum \"begged me to, so I joined a local one\".\nShe joined three local pageants a year from 2007 to 2009 - two in Cebu province in central Philippines and one national pageant - and won all titles. She was one of 10 finalists in Miss Philippines-Earth in 2010.\nThey were not all pleasant experiences. Once, some of the candidates' sashes - which must be worn at all times in the competition - went missing. Replacements were quickly made, but some women ended up wearing their sashes even while brushing their teeth. Ms Maynard slept with hers under her pillow.\n\"In other pageants, someone would cut the strap of a bikini or the strap of a sandal,\" she said.\n\"The number one rule is that you have to watch your belongings because there could be a lot of theft, like make-up and cell phones go missing,\" Ms Maynard said.\nBut she had good memories too, and said she made many friends. She learned how to dress up and present herself, when before joining she \"didn't even know or bother to comb my hair\".\n\"So when we do these lunges, and we wiggle our hips, it's really tiresome. And we all do this in four-inch heels minimum. It helps us to lengthen our stride and to put more sway in our hips,\" Ms Maynard said.\nSometimes she had to do the high-heeled lunges while answering questions called out by her mentors.\n\"And then, every so often while we're doing it, one of them [trainers] would just call out a question, like you know, 'If you had to take out an element out the universe, which element would it be and why? Earth, wind, fire or water?'\n\"It's really not just about smiling and standing in front of people. It's a lot of hard work,\" said Ms Maynard, now 27.\nEven the tiny details matter, Mr Gaffud said.

After five years of David Cameron, patients at hundreds of surgeries can no longer get a GP appointment when they need one.\"\nIn other election developments:\nThis issue includes NHS funding, GP access and social care, particularly of older people.\nPolicy guide: Where the parties stand\nLabour has pledged \u00a32.5bn to pay for 8,000 more GPs, guaranteeing appointments within 48 hours. Mr Burnham said the last Labour government had introduced an extended-hours scheme which, in 2009, funded 77% of surgeries to open on evenings and weekends.\nThe Commons answer suggested the coalition had reduced extended access funding in England from \u00a33.01 per patient to \u00a31.90 per patient, meaning that - by 2013/14 - 72% of surgeries offered extended hours under the scheme, a reduction of 590, according to Labour's interpretation.\nBut Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Labour's figures were wrong, because they did not take into account the Prime Minister's Challenge Fund, which covers 1,100 practices and helps 7.5 million patients see a GP in the evenings and at weekends.\n\"We are extending this scheme to cover over 1,400 additional practices, helping 10 million extra people by this time next year,\" he said, adding that a Conservative government would deliver \"a truly seven-day NHS\".\nPilot schemes paid for by this fund include those testing approaches such as the use of technology, health apps, and allowing access to services by video call, email or telephone.\nMr Hunt blamed Labour's \"disastrous\" renegotiation of the NHS contract for GPs in 2004 for creating the problem, which Conservatives say \"meant 90% of GPs stopped giving out-of-hours care\".\nThe Lib Dems also pointed to a \u00a350m GP Access Fund, which they say helped 1,147 practices to extend their hours last year.\nParty election spokesman Lord Scriven said: \"The Liberal Democrats are the only party prepared to commit to spending the \u00a38bn extra the NHS says it needs to survive.\"\nMeanwhile, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has been setting out how a crackdown on tax dodgers - and increased tax on shareholders' dividend payments - would fund a rise in the personal allowance to \u00a312,500.\nThe party wants to increase the point at which people start paying income tax to \u00a311,000 next year, then to \u00a312,500 by 2020.\nHaving spent much of Monday battling the Conservatives to claim credit for the increase in the threshold to \u00a310,600 that had come in overnight, Mr Clegg continued his attack on his former coalition partners.\n\"The Liberal Democrats have got a plan to give further tax cuts to people on low and middle incomes by asking a little bit more from the wealthiest,\" he said.\n\"The Conservatives... want to give tax cuts to the wealthiest by taking from the poorest. That's the difference and that's the choice which people have got when it comes to tax cuts at this election.\"\nIncreasing the personal allowance to \u00a311,000 would give 27 million people an \u00a380 tax cut and take 376,000 people out of tax altogether, including 157,000 pensioners.\nBoth the Conservatives and the Lib Dems want to raise the threshold to \u00a312,500, but the Lib Dems say they would implement the \u00a31bn measure \"far faster\".\nPrime Minister David Cameron's focus is on attacking Labour, as he embarks on a tour of the home nations.\nStarting in Scotland before visiting Northern Ireland, Wales and England, he said he was delivering a simple message: \"We have one month to save Britain from [Ed Miliband's] mountain of debt; one month to save Britain from his punitive taxes; one month to save Britain, and British families, from his anti-business and anti-aspiration agenda.\n\"With every day that passes, the choice at this election becomes clearer and clearer.

{"id": "11730332", "article": "As no single party or bloc commands a majority of the 325 seats in parliament, the contenders have had to forge new partnerships and deals in their efforts to share out the positions of power.\nThis is the main Shia parliamentary bloc. It was formed after the March 2010 elections as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance (INA).\nThe National Alliance decided in October to support Mr Maliki's bid for a second term as premier, but the decision was reportedly not unanimous.\nSTATE OF LAW COALITION: This grouping - which merged with the Iraqi National Alliance to form the National Alliance - is led by outgoing Prime Minister Maliki, who has been seeking a second term in power.\nThe bloc purportedly cut across religious and tribal lines. It included Mr Maliki's Shia Islamist Dawa [Call] Party as well as some Sunni tribal leaders, Shia Kurds, Christians and independents.\nMr Maliki said the alliance wanted an Iraq built on nationalist principles.\nHowever, many of the minority Sunnis apparently aren't confident that he truly believes they should be given a large share of power.\nMr Maliki hoped to capitalise on successes of his first term in office. However, his record on security was undermined by a series of high-profile attacks on government targets in Baghdad before the March elections.\nIRAQI NATIONAL ALLIANCE (INA): This mainly Shia alliance - which merged with the State of Law Coalition - includes followers of the powerful cleric and one-time militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr.\nIt brings together the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council (IISC), the Basra-based Fadhilah party, a few Sunni leaders, former prime minister Ibrahim Jaafari, and Ahmad Chalabi - the former exile who played a key role before the 2003 US-led invasion.\nJaafari was prime minister in the Iraqi Transitional Government between 2005 and 2006 and his reputation was tainted by the fact that militias took over the security services while he was in charge, and by the sectarian war that ensued.\nA senior leader of the IISC is outgoing Vice-President Adel Abdul-Mahdi.\nThe Kurdish coalition is dominated by the two parties administering Iraq's northern, semi-autonomous Kurdish region.\nThe Kurdistan Democratic Party led by the region's president, Masood Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Iraq's outgoing national president, Jalal Talabani, are both secular in nature and enjoy close ties with the West.\nThe two parties faced a major challenge in Kurdistan's parliamentary vote this year from the Reform (Change) bloc, which won about a quarter of the seats.\nThe Kurds have played king-maker in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and will likely retain enough clout to be part of a ruling alliance with another faction.\nThis alliance won the election by a slim two-seat margin over outgoing Prime Minister Maliki's State of Law, but neither came anywhere near the majority needed to govern.\nIt is led by former prime minister Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis who view him as a strongman capable of countering Shia power Iran.\nThe alliance includes outgoing Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni Arab, and senior Sunni politician Saleh al-Mutlaq. They ran on a nationalist platform.\nWhile all of the major coalitions have adopted a rhetoric of ''national unity'', al-Iraqiyya, and Saleh al-Mutlaq in particular, have a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of their rivals.\nThis group brings together a range of significant political figures, including Interior Minister Jawad Bolani and a leader of the Sunni anti-al-Qaeda militia in al-Anbar province, Ahmad Abu-Risha.\nUnity of Iraq has adopted a similar rhetoric to Mr Maliki's State of Law list, probably prompting suggestions that key figures in the list, such as Abu-Risha, appeared to have been seriously considering joining Mr Maliki.\nLike al-Iraqiyya, the Unity of Iraq list was seriously affected by the ban on candidates with alleged Baathist links.\nThe Iraqi Accord Front, an alliance of parties led by Sunni politicians, participated in the December 2005 elections but has since been weakened by splits and defections. It includes Speaker of the last parliament, Ayad al-Samarrai.\nIt consists of some tribal leaders and the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), which has increased its political visibility over recent years, enhancing its claim to represent Iraqi Sunnis at a national level.\nTribal leaders were courted by major parties as it was thought they would play an important role in the election. Some of Iraq's Sunni tribal leaders sprang to prominence when US forces began backing local sheikhs against al-Qaeda in 2006.\nWhile the tribal figures are looking to branch out into mainstream politics, they have not formed a united front and have mainly joined forces with existing blocs.\nSmaller minorities, including Turkmen, Christians, Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans, Shabak and others, were thought likely to ally with bigger electoral lists in areas where they were not dominant.\nBBC Monitoring selects and translates news from radio, television, press, news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages.

She says she has seen the iridescent clouds only once with her own eyes - and she knows precisely when and what to look for.\nSuch phenomena could have taken Munch completely by surprise, she believes.\nThe team first started investigating the possible link between the unusual meteorology and The Scream when consultant Svein Fikke observed a display of the clouds in 2014.\nHe managed to take a series of stunning photos, and then started delving deeper into the story.\nSome very rare cloud types are reported to be increasing in frequency and distribution, perhaps due to climate change.\nAn example would be Noctilucent Clouds. These are the highest clouds on Earth, forming at altitudes of 80km and more. There is evidence to suggest they are becoming more visible at lower latitudes than used to be the case.\nIt is conceivable similar trends might occur with Nacreous Clouds, Dr Muri said, although no statistics can justify such a statement yet.\n\"We know that the troposphere is warming and expanding while the stratosphere above is compressing and cooling. So, the temperature characteristics of minus 80C and below might become commonplace in the future,\" she speculated.", "summary": "Norwegian scientists have put forward a new theory to explain the inspiration behind one of the most famous works of art ever produced."}

In more than half, it was as good or better than a professional human player.\nResearchers from Google DeepMind said this was the first time a system had learned how to master a wide range of complex tasks.\nThe study is  published in the journal Nature.\nDr Demis Hassabis, DeepMind's vice president of engineering, said:  \"Up until now, self-learning systems have only been used for relatively simple problems.\n\"For the first time, we have used it in a perceptually rich environment to complete tasks that are very challenging to humans.\"\nTechnology companies are investing heavily in machine learning. In 2014, Google purchased DeepMind Technologies for a reported \u00c2\u00a3400m.\nThis is not the first time that a machine has mastered complex games.\nIBM's Deep Blue - a chess-playing computer - famously beat the world champion Garry Kasparov in a match staged in 1997.\nHowever, this artificial intelligence system was pre-programmed with a sort of instruction manual that gave it the expertise it needed to excel at the board game.\nThe difference with DeepMind's computer program, which the company describes as an \"agent\", is that it is armed only with the most basic information before it is given a video game to play.\nDr Hassabis explained: \"The only information we gave the system was the raw pixels on the screen and the idea that it had to get a high score. And everything else it had to figure out by itself.\"\nThe team presented the machine with 49 different videogames, ranging from classics such as Space Invaders and Pong, to boxing and tennis games and the 3D-racing challenge Enduro.\nIn 29 of them, it was comparable to or better than a human games tester. For Video Pinball, Boxing and Breakout, its performance far exceeded the professional's, but it struggled with Pac-Man, Private Eye and Montezuma's Revenge.\n\"On the face it, it looks trivial in the sense that these are games from the 80s and you can write solutions to these games quite easily,\" said Dr Hassabis.\n\"What is not trivial is to have one single system that can learn from the pixels, as perceptual inputs, what to do.\n\"The same system can play 49 different games from the box without any pre-programming. You literally give it a new game, a new screen and it figures out after a few hours of game play what to do.\"\nThe research is the latest development in the field of \"deep learning\", which is paving the way for smarter machines.\nScientists are developing computer programs that - like the human brain - can be exposed to large amounts of data, such as images or sounds, and then intuitively extract useful information or patterns.\nExamples include machines that can scan millions of images and understand what they are looking at: they can tell a cat is a cat, for example. This ability is key for self-driving cars, which need an awareness of their surroundings.\nOr machines that can understand human speech, which can be used in sophisticated voice recognition software or for systems that translate languages in real-time.\nDr Hassabis said: \"One of the things holding back robotics today, in factories, in things like elderly care robots and in household-cleaning robots, is that when these machines are in the real world, they have to deal with the unexpected. You can't pre-program it with every eventuality that might happen.\n\"In some sense, these machines need intelligence that is adaptable and they have to be able to learn for themselves.\"\nSome fear that creating computers that can outwit humans could be dangerous.\nIn December, Prof Stephen Hawking said that the development of full artificial intelligence \"could spell the end of the human race\".\nFollow Rebecca on Twitter", "summary": "A machine has taught itself how to play and win video games, scientists say."}

There wasn't an opportunity to talk about it, no invitation to chat about it from anyone I saw.\"\nIt was only after the birth that Rachael admitted to a health visitor that she felt detached, lonely and depressed. She had experienced suicidal thoughts too.\nDuring a 12-month wait for talking therapy on the NHS, she relied on family and friends to help her get through each day with postnatal depression.\nAnd, in the meantime, she set up a charity dedicated to pre and postnatal depression advice and support, called the PANDAS Foundation.\nShe says the Charlotte Bevan inquest demonstrates how important it is for pregnant women to be able to talk about their mental health.\nRachael wants communication between health professionals to improve so that women like her are properly supported during pregnancy.\nShe also believes doctors and midwives need a better understanding of mental health so that they can ask the right questions and offer support at the right times.\nIf or when a pregnant woman's mental health deteriorates, the guidelines state that all women with a child under a year old should be offered a place in one of the 17 specialist psychiatric care mother and baby units in the UK.\nBut a map of these dedicated mother and baby units, with an average of eight beds per unit, show that some areas such as the south, south-west and east of England, and Wales, are noticeably underserved.\nAnother map of specialist community perinatal mental health teams across the UK shows there is a very patchy service, with most areas having an extremely basic level of provision, or none at all.\nHowever, Alistair Burt, Minister of State for Community and Social Care, said perinatal mental health was a strong priority for the government and it was investing \u00c2\u00a375m over the next five years \"to help drive improvements\".\n\"Since 2010 the number of in-patient mother and baby units which specialise in caring for women during the perinatal period has almost doubled and we have trained more than 600 perinatal mental health visitor champions.\"\nThe Royal College of Midwives has said that more midwives with specialist training in mental health are needed to work with at-risk women.\nBut this relies on GPs, midwives and health visitors recognising that their patients are suffering in the first place.\nNHS England estimates that around 3% of women who give birth each year will be referred to psychiatric services and 1% will need specialised care in a mother and baby unit.\nThat's 6,700 women with serious mental illnesses who need specialist help.\nThey are at one end of a wide spectrum of mental illnesses which can affect pregnant women - ranging from mild to severe.\nRachael did not take any medication for her condition. All she wanted was to speak to someone else who felt the way she did, so she could feel normal.\nInstead, she suffered in silence.", "summary": "The family of Charlotte Bevan, whose body was found in the Avon Gorge with her four-day old daughter, has called for a dedicated service which looks after women with serious mental health problems before, during and after childbirth."}

Gunner was 83 years old.\nWith his Mount Vernon plantation creaking under financial pressure owing to his long absences serving the country, Washington would fire off angry letters to his overseers insisting on greater crop productivity.\nGiven these reprimands it is perhaps hardly surprising that another of his estate managers, Hiland Crow, was notorious for brutally flogging slaves.\nIn early 1788 the Potomac river froze over for five weeks, but even with nine inches of snow on the ground, Washington did not spare them from gruelling outdoor labour.\nHe sent the female slaves to dig up tree stumps from a frozen swamp.\nDuring this Arctic snap, Washington ventured to ride out and inspect his farms, but noted in his diary that, \"finding the cold disagreeable I returned\".\nWhen some of his slaves absconded during the Revolutionary War to find protection - humiliatingly, for him - with the enemy, Washington did not let up in his efforts to reclaim what he saw as his property.\nOne internal British memo portrayed him after victory as demanding the runaways be returned \"with all the grossness and ferocity of a captain of banditti\". The British refused.\nWhenever George and Martha's bondmen and women did flee, the first couple seemed to regard them as disloyal ingrates.\nIn one runaway notice Washington posted in a newspaper, he wrote that a slave named Caesar had escaped \"without any cause whatever\".\nThat these enslaved human beings might thirst for freedom, or even the opportunity to learn to read and write, did not seem to occur to him.\nProfessor Joseph Ellis, author of American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson, says of the founding fathers: \"They could imagine a nation-sized republic, which nobody else had ever done before.\n\"They could imagine the separation of church and state, which nobody else had ever done before.\n\"They could imagine a government based on checks and balances that prohibit any form of dictatorship at the presidential level. Nobody had ever done that before.\n\"They could imagine power flowing from the people upwards, rather than from God downward.\n\"All those unbelievable acts of imagination. The most creative political group in American history. We'll never replicate that.\n\"But they could not imagine a biracial society.\"\nJefferson, as every American schoolchild knows, is the nation's third president, and a genius political theoretician who penned arguably the five most important words in modern history - \"all men are created equal\" - in the 1776 Declaration of Independence.\nHe also owned up to 140 slaves.\nA bon vivant who lived in luxury at a palatial Virginia estate, Jefferson knew America's original sin was a \"depravity\", as he described it.\nBut his statements about black people are rarely taught in classrooms today.\nHere are some Jefferson quotes that visitors will not find on his memorial, a Roman pantheon-style temple to liberty where the Sage of Monticello's graven image keeps vigil over the Tidal Basin in Washington DC.\nTo his friend, French social reformer the Duc de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, Jefferson confided that he envisaged eventual manumission to entail \"exporting to a distance the whole black race\".\nThe duke wrote: \"He [Jefferson] bases his opinion on the certain danger\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 of seeing blood mixed without means of preventing it\".\nAnd yet Jefferson, historians say, fathered up to six children by one of his mixed-race slaves, Sally Hemings.\nIn his book Notes on the State of Virginia, he prophesied a race war in America and \"convulsions which will probably never end but on the extermination of the one or the other race\".\nJefferson also opined in this work that black people's \"unfortunate difference of color\" made them less beautiful than whites.\n\"They are more ardent after their female,\" he continued, \"but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation.\n\"Their griefs are transient\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in reason much inferior.\"\nAnd so on.\nProfessor Ellis believes a plaque should be put up at the Jefferson Memorial to correct the record and admit some of the Declaration author's less savoury statements.\n\"Jefferson embodies the inherent contradictions, a kind of self-deception, that co-exists in us, too,\" the biographer said.\n\"Given the relationship with Hemings, the fact that he refused to take a leadership position on ending slavery because of his fear of miscegenation, it makes his hypocrisy even more dramatic.\n\"He's got slaves who are his children serving him at dinner. But he doesn't seem to find that troubling. It's mind-boggling.\"\n\"Racism is a chromosome in the DNA of the United States,\" Professor Ellis added. \"It's like cancer. It ain't never gonna be cured.\"\nShould Americans therefore disavow these founding fathers as scoundrels and national embarrassments, or accept them as men of their time, demigods with feet of clay, who bore their imperfections even as they sought to steer their country beyond them?\nWhat actually is the difference between monuments to the founding fathers and Confederate leaders?\nDr Clarence Jones - the African-American speechwriter who helped civil rights legend Dr Martin Luther King Jr craft his 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" address, four words that shaped modern America - explains.\nHe says: \"Sure, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.\n\"There was no question they were morally compromised in their effort to fashion together this new country, a republic, based on the principles and precepts enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.\n\"But neither of those two persons led the nation in treasonous insurrection to overthrow the government they had formed in order to preserve the institution of slavery. Period.\n\"On the contrary, they devoted their life to saving and founding this country.\"\nHe says that commemorating the valour of the Confederacy is just as wrong as celebrating the soldiers of the Third Reich.\n\"What Charlottesville tells us is, it's no longer possible for the United States to ignore this unresolved issue of reconciliation over slavery,\" said Dr Jones.\n\"Trump missed an extraordinary opportunity - and he still has it - of exercising the leadership of reconciler and healer-in-chief for the nation today.\"\nWashington and Jefferson are not the only American historical titans who can seem diminished when viewed through the lens of present-day values.\nTake Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator and Civil War leader who destroyed the South's slavocracy.\nHe is immortalised in another neo-classical shrine on the National Mall.\nBut as Hofstra University history professor Alan Singer points out, the nation's 16th president espoused racist opinions as his political soul evolved.\nHe is quoted as saying to applause at a debate at Charleston, Illinois, during an 1858 Senate election campaign: \"There is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.\"\nThe Republican leader is also recorded as having tried to persuade a black delegation in 1862 that African-Americans should self-deport and colonise somewhere like Central America, arguing that it would be \"extremely selfish\" if they refused.\n\"The United States needs to have a general evaluation of who we are as a nation, so we can come to terms with our present by understanding our past,\" says Professor Singer.\n\"Nations need heroes to define who we are, to help us see ourselves in a better light.\n\"And the United States has heroes. But we tend not to see the warts.\n\"We tend to try to erase the parts we don't want to see. And this is a time when we have to look.\"\nSometimes, though, it can be hard to look.\nPresident Lyndon Baines Johnson is lionised as the signer of the 1964 Civil Rights Act - one of the greatest legislative accomplishments of any US administration - which outlawed discrimination.\nHowever, LBJ is also known to have frequently tossed racial slurs around the cloakrooms of the US Senate, according to his biographer Robert Caro.\nJohnson nicknamed an earlier iteration of the landmark act for which he is known as \"the n***** bill\".\nIn his memoir, Capitol Hill in Black and White, African-American chauffeur Robert Parker relates a disturbing interaction while he was driving for the Texan.\nJohnson, he recalls, asked him whether he objected to being called \"n*****\".\nWhen Parker replied that he would rather be addressed by his own name, Johnson allegedly retorted: \"As long as you are black, and you're gonna be black till the day you die, no one's gonna call you by your goddamn name.\n\"So no matter what you are called, n*****, you just let it roll off your back like water, and you'll make it. Just pretend you're a goddamn piece of furniture.\"\nBut Dr Jones believes that LBJ, for all his flaws, understood that his duty as chief magistrate of the United States was to lead his country towards sunlit uplands of a more perfect union, to achieve the unfulfilled promise of its founding.\nThe University of San Francisco professor is in little doubt what his old friend, Dr Martin Luther King Jr, would say to the current White House incumbent.\n\"I have no question,\" says Dr Jones, \"that the pre-eminent apostle of love and non-violence in the 20th Century would remind President Trump he has a responsibility to indicate to the nation what is right and what is wrong.\n\"This is not a time to engage in moral relativity.\n\"I really believe that President Trump is not beyond redemption, that he still has an opportunity to rise to the majesty of the office.\"", "summary": "President Donald Trump's argument that the removal of Confederate statues is a slippery slope to changing history has recharged the perennial debate about America's tormented racial legacy."}

As a lawyer in New York, I represented a lot of galleries, auction houses and dealers that had problems bringing items in and out of the United States. So I was very aware of the smuggling routes that take place, and the traffic that is involved with antiquities.\n\"What's happened now is Isis and other people are taking advantage of the war in Syria to tap into these markets and sell their goods on a worldwide basis.\n\"You've got some very poor people doing the digging, and selling to a middleman who moves the objects on to Lebanon, through Beirut into Turkey and then into the Western world. We've heard reports of Isis taxing the trade, up to around 20%.\n\"The number one funding for Isis is oil, and after that, kidnapping and ransom demands. When they don't have access to those, they look for something else, and the antiquities in their backyard have provided a natural source for income.\n\"Stopping this crisis requires a multi-faceted approach, where number one is [to] stop the war. Number two is to increase awareness of collectors and dealers and auction houses not to purchase material that has no provenance.\n\"We are just one small portion of the solution: we run the Art Claim database. We have donated our services to museums and anyone on the ground who wants to identify works that are being looted. A museum can download its entire collection and say 'put this on your database; if anything ever appears in the marketplace, it's not authorised to be sold'.\n\"As soon as the conflict happened in Syria, we reached out to our contacts on the ground to put everything they could on the database, even before it was stolen.\nSyria's riches\n\"Once a looted object is reported to us, it goes onto the database. Then we check the sales catalogues of all the major auction houses. We've got teams of people checking eBay, Amazon, other sale venues. We're also a very sophisticated searchable database with visual recognition software, so dealers and collectors contact us and say 'I'm about to buy something' or 'someone's approached me with something. Should I buy it? Is it on your database?'\n\"The first thing we look at is the provenance. Where did you get it from? Do you have a receipt? Was there a history that was given to you? We can't always rely on it because we've known the smugglers to falsify provenance information. But we look at what was given. And we're pretty adept at determining whether it's legitimate or not or whether it was made up or whether it's completely absent.\n\"We then notify the authorities. We are a free service to law enforcement. They know that if they place objects on our database, we will tell them where they are. We turn over all the information. I'm about to go to Venice at the invitation of the Italian government, and that follows Poland and Romania and Bulgaria and other governments.\n\"We have several hundred thousand objects on our database, and that's only since March, 2015. It's growing exponentially. The FBI database has just 15,000 objects. The Interpol database has about 40,000 objects. The Italian police have a fantastic database, and next year they will be changing it to work with Interpol.\n\"But they're not actually checking the marketplace the way we are. They don't have the funds to do that. They don't have the manpower.\n\"The Italians have done it right: they've got 300 officers dedicated to art crime. But let's look at the United States: a 320 million population with just 16 FBI agents in the art crime team. And they're also assigned to bomb duty as well.\n\"Here in London there are just a handful of in the art crime unit. They are overworked, underpaid and the whole department could use an overhaul.\n\"We've noticed a big jump in dealers and collectors checking with us, and that is evidence of fear.\n\"In the US, the FBI has issued a declaration that anybody who is found to have been purchasing looted Syrian objects could be prosecuted under a US Federal Law about funding international terrorism. That's pretty scary.\n\"We've seen some wild reports that the markets are being flooded with this material, but we haven't seen the really high-end antiquities getting here. We know of a recent container that was seized here in the UK with a great deal of Syrian looted objects on it, and I can't go too much beyond that because it's a current investigation here in the UK.\n\"But other than that container, we're seeing a lot of low-level material, and a lot of fakes. A lot of people are trying to take advantage of the situation and send fakes through and pretend that they're real.\n\"The better, more reputable auction houses do not want to sell this type of material in their sales room. It's the lower to mid-level dealer that [poses the risk]. It's that way with fine art as well: you always have those people who are looking to get a good deal without asking any questions.\n\"That's a big threat because it creates a market, and as long as there's a market for this type of illicit and looted material, it's going to be dug out of the ground. And when you have a situation like we have in Syria - where the government is near collapse, and there's no authority to really stop the export of this type of material - you have chaos.\"\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT/13:05 BST.

Islamic State later said it was behind the assault.\nIn pictures: Paris remembers with flags\nWhat happened on the night\nWho were the victims?\nWho were the attackers?\nSome of the survivors who attended were in wheelchairs, while members of the fire and ambulance services wore uniforms for the 45-minute ceremony in the courtyard of the historic Les Invalides complex.\nIn his speech, President Hollande said France would \"do all it can to destroy this army of fanatics\".\n\"It will operate relentlessly to protect its children.\" he said.\nHe vowed that France would respond with more music, concerts and sporting events, after some of the attacks targeted a concert venue and a stadium.\nAmong those attending the service were the parents of British victim Nick Alexander, who said that they were now \"intrinsically linked\" to those who had also lost loved ones.\n\"The outpouring of love from around the world has been a great comfort to us and makes us even more proud to have had Nick as our son,\" they added.\nIt started with a song that said it all: \"When all we have is love.\" The lyrics of the iconic singer Jacques Brel echoed through the Court of Honour of the Invalides - a place where the French nation delivers its highest tributes to heroes and casualties of war.\nThere was a silent pause and the names of those who lost their lives were read out. We heard their age too - most of them in their twenties or thirties. It was a long and painful listen as portraits were screened in the courtyard.\nFrancois Hollande was the only speaker - he gave a brief and simple address, in which he paid tribute to the \"130 smiles and faces\" of the victims.\nAnnouncers read out the names and ages of all 130 victims, from 39-year-old Stephane Albertini to 37-year-old Stella Verry.\nHowever, not all the victims' families accepted the invitation to attend the service at the grand complex that houses a military museum and Napoleon's tomb.\nThe family of one victim told French media they had refused, saying not enough had been done to protect the nation in the wake of other attacks earlier this year.\nPresident Hollande has this week embarked on a diplomatic push to increase support for the fight against IS militants.\nHe flew to Washington to meet President Barack Obama, then met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian PM Matteo Renzi before travelling for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, where more coordination on air strikes and intelligence was agreed.\nCooperation with the regime? Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris\nIs France signalling an important shift in policy on Syria? That is the question after the French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius spoke on French radio this morning.\nMr Fabius said France's aim was to destroy Raqqa, the self-declared capital of IS in Syria. For that, bombing was needed, he said, but also ground forces. France would not provide ground troops, he added, so the fighting would have to be done by the Syrian opposition, Sunni Arab armies, and, controversially, the regime forces of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.\nAs international news wires hummed, Mr Fabius rowed back slightly.  In a \"clarification\", he said the participation of Syrian government forces would only be possible within the framework of a political transition. In other words, only once there was agreement on the eventual departure of Assad.\nBut it remains a significant development for the French to say that government troops may form part of their plan for destroying IS. As for the practicality of Syrian troops cooperating with the Syrian opposition, that is another matter.\nOn Friday, France said for the first time that Syrian government forces could contribute to a ground campaign against IS.\nSyria quickly welcomed the suggestion, although French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius later clarified the forces could only take part if a process was under way leading to the removal of President Bashar al-Assad.\nIn a series of co-ordinated attacks on 13 November, gunmen opened fire on restaurants and bars in Paris and stormed a concert hall, where 89 people were shot dead.\nThree more attackers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France stadium in Saint-Denis, north of Paris, after staff denied them entry to a football match between France and Germany.\nMore than 350 people were injured in the attacks - the worst in recent French history.\nThe unanswered questions\nIs bashing Belgium justified?\nAt least nine people are believed to have been directly involved in carrying out the latest attacks.\nThey are all dead, but two more men, including suspect Salah Abdeslam, are still on the run as a huge manhunt continues in France and Belgium.\nSome of the attackers - including suspected ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who died in a police raid in Paris last week - had lived in Brussels.\nOn Friday, a Belgian judge charged a sixth suspect there with offences in connection with the Paris attacks.

{"id": "13144271", "article": "An older generation of practitioners had traditionally relied on a long-established formula, performing illusions that were often mysterious but lacking in spontaneity and humour.\nDaniels brought a chirpy, cheeky persona to his act - albeit one which was not to everyone's taste - which seemed to thrive on close contact with his audience.\nModern technology allowed TV cameras to home in on the close magic at which he excelled, yet on a larger scale, his illusions - most of which he devised himself -  broke new ground in terms of complexity and sophistication.\nHe was born Newton Edward Daniels in the South Bank area of Middlesbrough on 6 April 1938. His father worked as a projectionist at the local Hippodrome Theatre.\nHis interest in magic was sparked when he read a book entitled How to Entertain at Parties and he began practising tricks for his family and friends before performing in local youth clubs.\nThere was an added bonus in that, as a small and shy child, he finally had a skill that would boost his confidence and make people take notice of him.\n\"From that moment,\" he later said, \"I can safely say that all I ever wanted to do in life was to become a professional magician.\"\nAfter leaving grammar school, the young Daniels found a job as a junior clerk in the treasury department of the local council.\nHe did his national service with the Green Howards, a regiment with close connections to the north-east of England. He found himself posted to Hong Kong, where he continued to hone his skills as a magician by giving impromptu performances to fellow soldiers.\nAfter he was demobbed, he began training as an accountant before joining his parents in a small grocery business. Eventually he set up his own mobile shop.\nBut magic remained his abiding interest and his evenings were spent performing in local variety clubs. After marrying Jacqueline Skipworth in 1960, the couple often performed together as The Eldanis, an anagram of his surname.\nNorthern club audiences had a reputation for being somewhat unforgiving and prone to heckle performers who, in their opinion, did not come up to the mark.\nAccording to Daniels, it was abuse from one heckler in Bradford that made him come up with the retort: \"You'll like this - not a lot, but you'll like it,\" which would become his catchphrase.\nHe developed his style of patter as a way of keeping the audience entertained and as a useful diversion when he had to perform a particularly tricky sleight of hand.\nHis breakthrough came in 1969 when he was offered a summer season in Newquay. He sold his grocery shop and became a full-time entertainer.\nAfter an appearance on the talent show Opportunity Knocks, Daniels caught the eye of Johnny Hamp, a senior executive with Granada Television who gave him a regular slot on The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club, a variety show compered by Bernard Manning and set in a fictional working men's club.\nIn 1978, ITV gave him his own Sunday night television show and, the following year, he moved to the BBC with the Paul Daniels Magic Show, which ran for 15 years.\nAs well as performing his own tricks, Daniels had a segment of the show known as the Bunco Booth, in which he exposed the underhand methods used by street confidence tricksters. A 1985 Easter edition of his show won the prestigious Golden Rose of Montreux.\nBy this time, he was in both a professional and personal relationship with the woman who became his on-stage assistant, the former ballerina Debbie McGee. The couple, who had first worked together during a 1979 summer season in Great Yarmouth, married in 1988.\nAt the peak of his fame, he also hosted a number of other television series including the quiz shows Odd One Out, Every Second Counts and Wipeout, and the children's television programme Wizbit.\nThere was controversy in 1987 when Daniels performed, on live TV, a recreation of a Harry Houdini trick in which he was chained inside a replica of a medieval iron maiden, an instrument of torture. He had to escape before the door swung fully shut to avoid being impaled on spikes.\nWhen Daniels failed to appear, the screen cut to black, giving the impression the trick had gone badly wrong. The BBC's phone lines were jammed with calls from viewers, whose concern turned to complaints when it was all revealed to be a hoax. Daniels hadn't even warned family members who had been watching.\nHe was bitter when the BBC failed to renew his contract but continued to work in the theatre. There was a six-week run in The Magic Man in London's West End in 1994 and he created and staged special effects for hit shows such as Phantom of the Opera.\nHe often seemed more relaxed on the stage, where he saw himself as an actor, performing what seemed to be the impossible. He preferred to describe himself as a conjuror than a magician.\nDaniels and his wife took part in a programme in the series When Louis Met... in which documentary maker Louis Theroux delved into the lives of celebrities with a mocking wit.\nHe was also mercilessly lampooned on the satirical puppet show Spitting Image, in which his wig would rise up from his head and spin around on its own.\nMcGee herself became a target of comedian Caroline Aherne's Mrs Merton character, who memorably asked her: \"What first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?\". It became one of television's most popular one-liners.\nDaniels was outspoken in his political views and took a strong line on law and order, once publicly offering to help Ian Huntley, convicted of the Soham schoolgirl murders, to end his own life.\nThree years ago at the height of the Jimmy Savile revelations he recalled being routinely offered sex earlier in his career and admitted he couldn't be sure all the women he'd slept with were over 16.\nHe also had little truck with younger illusionists such as David Blaine, saying: \"If people were better educated in the world of magic, he would have greater difficulty than he's having. He's not very original.\"\nIf public tastes in TV magicians had changed from Daniels' heyday in the 70s and 80s, he did not let it affect his profile on British TV.\nIn 2004, he and McGee appeared in the Channel 5 reality TV show The Farm and, two years later, they appeared in the X Factor: Battle of the Stars.\nThey were the first act voted off the show, after singing Let Me Entertain You by Robbie Williams.\nIn 2010, Daniels also appeared on the eighth series of BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing, where he was paired with Ola Jordan.\nHe was the second celebrity voted off, following DJ and actor Goldie.\nOf his experience on the show, he told the Daily Mirror: \"It got rid of my inhibitions. That's a good thing that came out of Strictly.\n\"Debbie and I renewed our vows the other week and, for the first time in 22 and a half years, I danced properly with her.\"", "summary": "Paul Daniels brought a new dimension to the art of the stage magician, mixing complex tricks with jokes and non-stop patter."}

{"id": "33843240", "article": "The Premier League got under way this weekend, with many teams showing off their new signings, but who impressed and who had a debut to forget?\nFrom scoring a wonder goal to being booked after barely a minute on the pitch, BBC Sport takes a look at how some of those making their top-flight bow got on.\nDimitri Payet, signed by West Ham from Marseille in the summer, created more chances than any other player in Europe's top five leagues last season and he certainly added a creative edge to the Hammers' attack in Sunday's shock 2-0 win at Arsenal.\nThe 28-year-old took the free-kick that caught out Petr Cech and allowed Cheikhou Kouyate to head home the opener, and was a lively presence throughout.\nNewcastle's signing of Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum from PSV was certainly one of the more impressive captures of the summer, and the 24-year-old made a strong impression on his Premier League debut.\nWijnaldum headed Newcastle ahead against Southampton on Sunday, but the hosts could not hold on as the Saints fought back to earn a 2-2 draw.\nThere were plenty of reasons to be impressed with Swansea's performance as they held defending champions Chelsea to a 2-2 draw, and Andre Ayew was one of them.\nThe Ghana forward showed cat-like instincts to pull a rebound from a Thibaut Courtois save to catch out John Terry, before calmly steering the ball home for one the opening weekend's best goals.\nThe same could not be said for Andre's younger brother, however.\nJordan Ayew started for Aston Villa at Premier League new boys Bournemouth, but the former Lorient striker failed to make an impression and was substituted on the hour.\nHis replacement, Rudy Gestede, instead caught the eye as he grabbed the Villa winner.\nWith fellow debutant Wijnaldum impressing, Aleksander Mitrovic was evidently keen to make an impression when he climbed off the bench in the 75th minute.\nSadly, it was not the kind of impression he would have liked as, less than a minute after coming on, he was booked for a foul on Matt Targett. Youthful naivety from the 20-year-old.\nExciting, fast and skilful. Memphis Depay certainly looked like a signing that will get Manchester United fans on their feet, but what his Premier League debut performance lacked was a goal threat.\nThe 21-year-old Netherlands winger had a couple of half chances, but never really looked like troubling Michel Vorm in the Tottenham goal during Saturday's 1-0 win for Louis van Gaal's side.", "summary": "New season, new faces."}

How are you?\nJillian: We're great, thank you! We're in the car between photo shoots.\nIs that as glamorous as it sounds?\nJillian: Yeah, why not? It's definitely a lot of fun. Good to have the photos for later on in life!\nDo you get to take the clothes home?\nLucas: No!\nJillian: I'm working on that. Actually, the shoes I have on right now were part of a shoot. I kept talking about them and eventually they worked it out so I got to take them home with me. Hopefully down the line we'll get some more freebies!\nDoes being a dancer help you in front of the camera?\nJillian: I definitely think I'm more aware of how to hold my body. But Lucas isn't a dancer and he's doing just fine.\nLucas: She's been showing me some moves. I'm learning.\nHow long have you been Lion Babe?\nJillian: It's been two years since we've been working as Lion Babe every day - but our friendship started six years ago.\nI met Lucas at a party where, just by chance, I heard his music. So I introduced myself and told him I liked it. We didn't really stayed connected, but I followed his MySpace. And then I ended up in New York for college. I had to do a piece for school with original music - and Lucas was the only producer I knew.\nWe did that and it went very well. A very easy collaboration. Eventually I mentioned I was interested in singing and he came over to my apartment. He was making beats up right on the spot and our first attempt at making a real song was actually Treat Me Like Fire, which was our first single.\nThat song got you a lot of attention. When did you realise it had taken on a life of its own?\nJillian: When we first got a response from the UK, that was definitely surprising.  It was maybe two weeks after the song came out, and we were like: \"Woah! How did people in the UK find this?\"\nThen we started getting emails from UK labels. It all happened very fast but we knew the door was open, so we wanted to take it seriously.\nGrowing up in a showbusiness family (Hervey's mother is actress and singer Vanessa Williams), was it always in the back of your mind that you'd pursue music?\nJillian: Actually, growing up, I didn't want to go into acting and singing because that was my mum's thing. It was too much pressure. But dancing gave me more confidence to try other things.\nTreat Me Life Fire sampled Eunice Collins, and your next single sampled Nina Simone. It's very brave to draw that comparison. I guess you're very confident in your voice?\nJillian: I wouldn't say that! That's the beauty of working with a great producer. If he had the guts to make the beat I had to have the guts to sing it.\nI knew I didn't want to sound like all these people on the radio, so having these unique, rich voices was a challenge. If Nina Simone's on the track, I'd better step my game up!\nYou practically disappeared for 18 months after Treat Me Like Fire. What was happening?\nLucas: We had to write more songs! A lot of people thought we were more established that we actually were. In the end we only had one song.\nWhat's it like working with Pharrell and Mark Ronson? Is there a danger they'll dilute what made you special in the first place?\nLucas: We're not really worried about watering anything down. In the end, the main thing is \"do we feel it or not?\" If we don't, we should just move on.\nBut as fans of music, the experience of working with these people is amazing. I learned so much in our session. Not so much from the things he said but from watching him work. All of that cycles in your head for the next week. It expands your mind.\nSo what's Pharrell like in the studio?\nLucas: We had two days with him in Miami. He's a really busy guy, so he was working on other things at the same time.\nWe'd go into the studio and get started. Then he'd come in and vibe out for a minute, and he'd make some parts right there and then - like a bass line or a little guitar riff. Then he'd be like, \"OK, I gotta go. I'll be back in a couple of hours\".\nSo we'd take the parts and start writing and re-arranging. Then he'd come back and we'd show him what we'd got. He'd be like, 'OK that's cool\" and maybe lay down another line on top.\nSince you've been in the UK, you've performed covers of Curtis Mayfield's Move On Up and Janis Joplin's Piece of my Heart. Is that the kind of music you're trying to emulate?\nJillian: Not necessarily. When it came to doing these sessions, we really wanted to think of an American artist who'd come over the UK with a raw funky flavour, and who was really embraced. So if it wasn't a Janis song, it would have been Jimi Hendrix.\nOur parents introduced us to funk and soul, so it's a natural place for us to go - but we also love The Strokes and Grace Jones and Lee Scratch Perry.\nOften the songs we reference when we're writing are completely different from the ones we end up making!\nWhat are you obsessing over at the moment?\nLucas: This guy called D.R.A.M. - he's got this song called Cha Cha, which has this great melody with this mariachi, almost cheesy, trumpet sound. It's so good.\nTrumpets seem to be back in fashion at the minute.\nJillian: I like it. I used to play trumpet so why not? My trumpet's actually red. Fun fact.\nIs that coming out on the tour?\nJillian: Not telling!\nWonder Woman is out now on Outsiders/Universal.

{"id": "41035675", "article": "Just as the fighting for Mosul moved from east to west over the course of many months, the Iraqi military is now moving westwards towards the Syrian border.\nAlthough much smaller in size, Tal Afar has been a so-called Islamic State (IS) stronghold that the jihadist group has used as a strategic \"base\" since 2014.\nAnd Tal Afar has had ruthless rulers before - between late 2004 and early 2006, the city was controlled by al-Qaeda in Iraq, a precursor to IS.\nBefore it fell to IS, the city's population of 200,000 was predominantly ethnic Turkmen, a Turkic people who have their own language and customs. The majority were also Sunni Muslims.\nTal Afar's residents are not viewed as helpless victims by many in the region; for a relatively small population, security sources say a disproportionate number of men from the city filled the ranks of IS as commanders, judges and members of their vicious religious police.\nThe battle for Tal Afar could also escalate tensions between Iraq, its ethnic Kurdish minority, Turkey and Syria.\nTurkey refuses to close or move its military base near Mosul, claiming it could be needed to protect Iraqi Turkmen as well as the Turkish border. The mere idea of Turkish military action on Iraqi soil has been enough to cause many, from Washington to Baghdad, to lose sleep.\nKurdish leaders in Irbil are also keeping their eyes wide open as well - juggling the real or perceived threats from Sunni Arab insurgents, Turkish forces and an ever-growing number of Shia Arab militiamen.\nTal Afar is a two hour drive from the Turkish border, and the main road from Mosul to Syria runs through the city. It is, in many ways, the perfect location - and the right time - for a perfect storm.\nThe military assault on Tal Afar might seem clear cut, but the combination of forces involved invites complications on the ground.\nApproximately 40,000 troops are taking part in the fighting - three Iraqi Army divisions, Iraqi and US-led coalition special forces personnel, as well as \"government-backed\" paramilitary fighters from the Popular Mobilisation (Hashd al-Shaabi).\nThe Popular Mobilisation is an umbrella organisation under whose banner are militias like Kataib Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades), Moqtada al-Sadr's Saraya al-Salam - the current incarnation of the Mehdi Army - and the Badr Organisation.\nThe Popular Mobilisation's ranks also include fighters from Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a group trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force that has been accused of a number of kidnappings and attacks in Iraq.\nThe factions in the Popular Mobilisation are predominantly Shia and many are backed and funded by Iran. When you speak to them, many of their fighters do not try to hide their deep-seated disdain for Iraqi's Sunni population.\nRegardless of fears, internally and internationally, about the size and ultimate intentions of the Popular Mobilisation, it is not going away any time soon. It is needed, many argue.\nOnce Tal Afar has been recaptured, this menagerie of forces will face a tougher operation on a wider scale that could last for months.\nA case can be made that the number of ground troops available to take part in it will be as important as their weaponry and air support.\nAbout 290km (180 miles) south-west of Mosul, IS also holds a string of towns along the Iraqi part of the River Euphrates in Anbar province.\nThese villages are known collectively as \"al-Qaim\", and they are connected by the Euphrates to the last IS stronghold in Syria - Deir al-Zour province.\nDeir al-Zour is now the heart of the \"caliphate\" proclaimed by IS three years ago.\nAccurate figures are hard to come by, but there are an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 IS fighters on the Iraqi and Syrian sides of the Euphrates valley.\nSimply pushing the IS extremists over the Syrian border from Iraq will not be enough - and is likely to add to the problem of IS in Syria - but there is little more than inaudible rumblings about how Iraqi forces will maintain security once they have retaken al-Qaim.\nOne solution may be to leave the Popular Mobilisation in the area as a substitute police force, because it has enough manpower and will need a new task, and also because Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has spoken out against disbanding them.\nIn this scenario, Iraqi border security would be handled by forces that are heavily involved with Iran, yet backed by the government in Baghdad - which in turn, is backed by the US government and other powers.\nIraqi regular forces, as they work their way back to Baghdad, will have another problem to deal with; a large pocket of IS territory in the middle of the country that has been contained primarily for three years by Kurdish Peshmerga forces.\nThe fight for the city of Hawija may be as deadly as any so far, as it is a cut-off viper's nest. The IS fighters holding it truly have nowhere to run, should they try.\nThe minute the smoke clears from Hawija, the Iraqi military will be looking across the battlefield at the Peshmerga.\nThey distrust each other with equal fervour, and the only thing they have agreed on is need to the defeat IS.", "summary": "Tal Afar, about 55km (35 miles) to the west of Mosul, was always going to be next on the \"to do\" list for Iraqi forces."}

This decision, which denies him that victory, comes down to the very narrow legal remit that had to be fulfilled by his mental health tribunal.\nThe panel had one simple duty: to assess the patient's health and what would be clinically right for him.\nSo although we have not yet seen the full reasons, the tribunal's decision means it has decided that Brady is still suffering from paranoid schizophrenia or another treatable disorder.\nOnce it had come to that conclusion, it could further rule that it would be appropriate to keep Brady at Ashworth, either to receive treatment or because it would be necessary for his own safety or those of others.\nIt's going to be very difficult for him to challenge the decision because he can only launch an appeal if he can show that the tribunal got the law wrong.\nBrady has the right to challenge the decision.\nDr David Fearnley, medical director at Ashworth, said: \"We appreciate the time and effort the mental health tribunal has given to this case and its judgment is consistent with the expert opinions of our clinicians.\n\"Mr Brady suffers from a severe personality disorder and a mental illness which still require high-quality care.\n\"It is a testament to the staff of Ashworth Hospital that we have been able to stabilise his schizophrenia to the degree we have. However, his condition is chronic and will require this support for the foreseeable future.\"\nAsked if the tribunal, which was held in public at Brady's request, may have exacerbated the illness, Dr Fearnley said: \"I think the difficulty with an individual such as Ian Brady is that he has a complex mental disorder and for many years has been able to publicise his concerns.\n\"However, we see this as part of an overall problem which our experts are looking into and will continue to provide expert care.\"\nBrady has been on a hunger strike since 1999, and appeared at the tribunal with his feeding tube in place.

She died last year, aged 78, without knowing where her son's remains are.\nHer solicitor John Ainley said he thought she would have been \"satisfied\" by the tribunal's decision.\n\"She always felt that Ian Brady did not give the children any choice and consequently he should not have the choice to leave the hospital environment.\"\nTerry Kilbride, the brother of John, said Brady should stay in hospital.\n\"I don't believe he's going to kill himself, that's just a ploy, just another wind-up.\n\"I think to be honest he should go back to hospital, I think that's where he belongs, in the hospital, and keep him alive as long as possible because it's only him that knows where Keith Bennett is.\"\nBrady gave evidence for more than four hours at the tribunal, which sat at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Maghull.

German troops occupied Estonia during World War II, before being driven out by the Soviet army.\nFew nations formally recognised the Soviet annexation, and Estonians consider it an illegal occupation.\nOne of its legacies is a large Russian minority - about a quarter of the population, according to the 2011 census. In Soviet times, the influx of non-Estonians led some to fear for the survival of Estonian culture and language.\nThe Russians' status has been a cause of controversy. Some, including the Russian government, criticise requirements needed to obtain Estonian citizenship - especially the need to show a proficiency in the Estonian language - that left most ethnic Russians stateless after independence.\nEstonia says the criteria for citizenship are similar to those of most nations around the world, and have been in any case gradually eased. It says the number of stateless persons has dropped by 80% between 1992 and 2013.\nSince independence, Estonia has politically and economically anchored itself firmly to the West, joining the EU and Nato in 2004. It sent a contingent of troops as part of Nato operations in Afghanistan.\nRussia's intervention in the Ukrainian crisis in 2014 has triggered some nervousness in Estonia over President Vladimir Putin's intentions towards other former Soviet states. The Estonian government has been fiercely critical of Russia's behaviour and has affirmed its pro-Nato stance in response to the events in Ukraine.\nEstonian governments have tended to pursue strongly free-market economic policies, privatising state enterprises, introducing a flat-rate income tax, liberalising regulation, encouraging free trade and keeping public debt low.\nThere has also been a strong emphasis on making Estonia a world leader in technology, leading some to speak of an \"e-economy\".\nThis has included creating one of the world's fastest broadband networks, offering widespread free wireless internet, encouraging technology start-ups and putting government services online. In 2007, Estonia was the first country to allow online voting in a general election.\nThe country experienced an investment boom in the early 2000s, especially after EU membership, with high annual growth rates hovering between 7-10%.\nIn 2008, Estonia's economy was hit by the global financial crisis. The government adopted tough austerity measures and won plaudits for getting the economy back into shape.\nThe country joined the European single currency in January 2011.\nThe Estonian language is closely related to Finnish and - more distantly - Hungarian, but not to the Indo-European languages of the two other Baltic states - Latvia and Lithuania - or Russian for that matter.\nThe country has unique musical and dance traditions, including a long tradition of choral singing.", "summary": "Estonia is the most northerly of the three Baltic states, and has linguistic ties with Finland."}

{"id": "34745809", "article": "Advertising plays a central role at Christmas, and for over 100 years has extended its reach from posters to radio, TV and now online.\nSuccessfully making that last leap has become the holy grail of Christmas advertising.\n\"The strategy among the retailers now is to get the ad into a prime time spot,\" says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research agency Conlumino.\n\"From then on TV becomes less important as the message goes off into social media, where there is less cost and the reach can be phenomenal, far greater than TV.\"\nSo, let's look at how that works with one of the most famous, the John Lewis ManOnTheMoon commercial.\nIn early November it launched the ad, telling the story of a small child who sees a lonely old man through a telescope living on the moon, and sends him a Christmas present by balloon.\nConventional wisdom might assume that the campaign should spark interest in the retailer - John Lewis - but there's barely a mention of the name.\nInstead the aim seems to be to spark interest in the ad itself.\nTo this end John Lewis actually advertised the advertisement with a 10 second teaser commercial a week before it went live, and fired up social media interest with the #ManOnTheMoon hashtag.\nThree hours after the advert was aired, #ManOnTheMoon was trending with 40,000 tweets.\nAnd it doesn't stop there. Of the \u00c2\u00a37m spent on the campaign, John Lewis spent only \u00c2\u00a31m on the ad itself, which is just the tip of a merchandising iceberg.\nThere's an app offering moon-related information. There's a tie-in with a game that can be played on mobiles, sending your presents to the moon by balloon, though at this point Christmas sentimentality is abandoned in favour of eluding surface to air missiles.\nThen there's a link-in with ManOnTheMoon telescopes, pyjamas, bedding, mugs and so on.\n\"The key to the John Lewis ad is that people no longer watch real-time television,\" says Jacques de Cock of the London School of Marketing.\n\"They defer their watching to Netflix or YouTube, and to capitalise on this market advertisers have to make their ads into social phenomena.\"\nThe reality is that companies are having to make contact with a customer whose habits are dictated not by TV but by the internet.\nFor instance, view the new Harvey Nichols commercial and the last frame has a \"Shop Now\" button to take you straight to the store.\nYou can't do that on TV.\nBut the customer is doing a lot more than just clicking and buying Uncle Cedric's Christmas socks on Amazon.\nHe or she is researching, comparing prices and browsing online, before either clicking or physically marching into the store and demanding the socks over the counter.\nAccording to Forrester Research, by 2020, 53% of retail sales across Europe will be influenced one way or another by the online world.\nSo it is not important to an advertiser by what mechanism the money is spent. What matters is where the customer makes up his or her mind - and that space is increasingly a digital one.\nAll of which shapes the way ads are made.\nSainsbury's advert \"Mog's Christmas Calamity\" written by the writer and illustrator Judith Kerr runs for a full three and a half minutes. The traditional TV ad break spot could never support that on a regular basis - but the internet can.\nLifting time restrictions allows for a great deal more creativity. For instance, the Mulberry Christmas commercial turns the gift of a red bag into a parody of the Nativity, attended by shepherds and Wise Men, which is witty both visually and verbally (\"It is a thing of wonder\" extols one of the Wise Men).\nAnd there are other opportunities to add nuances to your brand.\nClick on the end of the Sainsbury's commercial and up come links to Judith Kerr's book, the making of the commercial, Save the Children, competitions, recipes and of course Sainsbury's produce.\n\"We love working for retail,\" says James Murphy, chief executive of adam&eveDDB, which made the John Lewis ad.\n\"Retail is the new rock and roll in advertising. It is a great shop window for your creativity and for your effectiveness.\"\nSome might argue the industry is taking itself a teensy weensy bit too seriously. The Burberry Christmas commercial, borrowing its theme from the play/movie Billy Elliot, rolls its own credits at the end.\nBizarrely, the prize for the most viewed ad this Christmas goes to the German supermarket chain Edeka which has been shared 2.39 million times online, leaving John Lewis (1.3 million) and Sainsbury (917,000) trailing in its wake.\nIt tells a tear-jerking tale, that some might find in questionable taste, of an old man abandoned by his family at Christmas, until, by faking his own death he manages to bring them round the table for Christmas dinner.\nEdeka doesn't have an international retail operation. Yet the ad appears on YouTube with English subtitles, suggesting the commercial is as interested in its own brilliance as it is in trying to sell a product.\nSupermarket chain Aldi tried to puncture this sort of self-indulgence by making a parody of John Lewis's ManOnTheMoon ad with the frail old gentleman debating whether he should buy a cheaper telescope at Aldi.\nBut it raises the question - does any of this actually increase sales?\nMarks and Spencer tried to tap into this market in 2014, with its Magic and Sparkle TV commercial showing fairies carrying out gratuitous acts of generosity.\nThe fairies gathered 42,000 Twitter followers and the campaign was hailed as the most imaginative social media event of the year.\nBut it didn't work in terms of sales and Christmas turnover slumped.\n\"The campaign is only successful if you have the right product at the right price,\" says Neil Saunders.\n\"People may want to come to the shop, but if they can't find what they want they won't buy.\"\nThis year M&S has avoided story-telling and instead opted for what is little more than a glitzy montage of its wares.\nHowever, Robert Jones head of new thinking at agency Wolff Olins argues the campaign was still effective.\n\"It may not have worked in terms of Christmas sales - but this is part of a long term strategy to create an image. You can't change the way people see you in a single year.\"\nSo is the John Lewis ad working?\nOn the big discount day, Black Friday, sales were up 4.8% on last year. But it is worth noting that whatever the long term effect, the only John Lewis item featured in the ad - a telescope - had sold out online five hours after the ad went live.", "summary": "The internet is reinventing the Christmas TV commercial, making it more creative, more ambitious - and arguably more self-regarding."}

And children from low income families have the greatest barriers,\" said James Westhead, executive director of Teach First.\nMost secondary schools in England now have academy status - but the annual report says that in terms of raising standards \"structural reform can only do so much\".\nAnd it highlights that being an academy does not \"insulate\" schools from decline, with 99 academies that had been good or outstanding being regraded as less than good.\nRoy Perry, chairman of the children and young people board at the Local Government Association, said ranking councils by school results \"disguises the fact that over 60% of secondary schools are now academies, leaving councils powerless to intervene early and build an improvement programme\".\n\"It is extremely worrying that over the last three years only 37% of secondary schools have actually improved their Ofsted rating after becoming academies.\"\nThe Ofsted report also highlights that pupils' progress up to the end of primary is too often not sustained when they move to secondary.\nThis was revealed last month in an analysis of this summer's GCSE results, by education data company, SchoolDash.\nThis mapped the growing north-south divide at GCSE level, but also showed there was much less of a gap in primary school.\nHead teachers' leader Brian Lightman linked the north-south gap to the \"very serious difficulties\" that schools faced in recruiting teachers.\nMr Lightman, head of the ASCL head teachers' union, said schools in challenging areas were finding it \"incredibly hard\" to find teachers in some shortage subjects, particularly affecting schools in some parts of the North.\nRussell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the gap between primary and secondary performance had been \"driven by the turmoil at secondary compared to primary\", such as the upheavals in exams and curriculum.\nEducation Secretary Nicky Morgan said: \"More needs to be done to deliver educational excellence everywhere.\"\n\"That's why we are introducing new measures to transform failing and coasting schools, funding the best academy chains to share excellence in struggling regions in the North and creating a National Teaching Service - sending some of our best teachers to the areas that need them most.\"", "summary": "Ofsted is warning of a north-south divide in England's secondary schools."}

{"id": "30376484", "article": "It was back in 2008, and James Watt and Martin Dickie's then tiny brewery at Fraserburgh, north-east Scotland, was little over a year old and struggling.\nSelling their US-style craft beers from the back of their van at farmers' markets, they were missing payments on their \u00a320,000 ($30,000) bank loan.\n\"We were selling a couple of cases on a good day, and losing money,\" says Mr Watt, now 32.\nAnd then they decided to enter a bottled beer competition organised by supermarket group Tesco. BrewDog won first, second, third, and fourth place.\n\"So we went down to Tesco's headquarters [just north of London], and they told us they loved our beer and wanted to put us in 500 shops, buying 2,000 cases a week,\" says Mr Watt.\n\"We put on our best poker faces and said 'no problem'. Yet we were just two guys filling bottles by hand.\"\nWith Tesco wanting first deliveries in four months' time, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie, also now 32, went to their bank to ask for another \u00a3150,000, so they could quickly install a bottling line, and expand production.\nBut failing to meet the payments on their existing loan, the bank said a firm \"no\".\nSo the business partners went to another lender, and lied.\nMr Watt says: \"We said that our bank had offered us an amazing deal, but that if you can match it we'll switch, and they went for it. You have got to do what you have to do.\"\nWith BrewDog now being able to increase its brewing facilities, it was able to start supplying Tesco on time with bottles of its Punk IPA.\nThe beer was an immediate hit, and the other UK supermarkets soon followed suit.\nFast forward to 2014, and BrewDog is due to see its turnover top \u00a332m this year.\nIt employs 357 people, and as well as continuing to supply the likes of Tesco UK-wide, it owns 25 bars, 18 across the UK, and seven abroad.\nAnd now based at a larger brewery down the road in the town of Ellon, it exports to 52 countries.\nChildhood friends who grew up in the Scottish town of Peterhead, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie started brewing beer together as a hobby in their early 20s.\nAt the time Mr Watt was working as a deep sea fisherman, while Mr Dickie was a whisky distiller.\nFrom the very start they were inspired to brew American-style craft beers - sweet-tasting ales with high alcohol levels and very large amounts of US hops, which gave them a bold, fruity, even perfumed flavour.\nThey are very Marmite beers in that you either love them or hate them. To fans they are flavoursome and interesting, to critics they are undrinkable.\nYet, confident they could convert drinkers, and after some good reviews, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie decided to quit their day jobs and start brewing professionally in 2007.\n\"Even though the first year was tough, we never lost faith in what we were doing,\" says Mr Watt. \"We were hell-bent... we were stupidly ambitious.\"\nIn addition to the bold flavours, the two men also worked hard on creating an irreverent brand image for BrewDog, giving their beers fun names, and bright, colourful labels. Some of their other brews are called Dead Pony Pale Ale, Dogma and Hardcore IPA.\nExpansion has been made possible after the business raised \u00a37m via crowdfunding, with 15,000 people paying \u00a395 for a stake in the company. In return they get discounts in BrewDog's bars, and other perks.\nIn more controversial matters, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie have also regularly - and enthusiastically - attacked regulators and industry bodies. Their critics say they do so simply to garner publicity, but Mr Watt says they are merely sticking up for themselves.\nEarlier this year the Portman Group, the UK drinks industry trade body that promotes responsible drinking, criticised BrewDog, saying that the label of the brewery's Dead Pony Pale Ale promoted anti-social behaviour and binge drinking.\nBrewDog's response at the time was as follows: \"Unfortunately, the Portman Group is a gloomy gaggle of killjoy jobsworths, funded by navel-gazing international drinks giants.\"\nWhen contacted by the BBC for this article, a spokesman for the Portman Group said: \"BrewDog's business model has traditionally used complaints by the public as a PR opportunity for their brands.\n\"BrewDog and the Portman Group have a long history... we don't expect them to like us, but we were pleased to see they have started relabeling their products.\"\nThere are no hard and fast rules on what makes a \"craft beer\". However, typically it is a natural beer made by a small brewery, often with large amounts of pungent hops and a marked sweetness from the barley malt\nSo what is the difference between \"craft beer\" and \"real ale\"? Unlike craft beer, real ale - as determined by UK pressure group Campaign For Real Ale - has to be unpasteurised and unfiltered. Real ale also more often has a drier flavour.\nCraft beer is also typically served well chilled and carbonated, whereas real ales are served less cold and have no added gas\nYet, like lager (which itself can be a craft beer or real ale), they share the same basic four ingredients - malted barley, hops, yeast and water. In all cases other ingredients can be added on top, such as different grains\nA similar dispute that BrewDog had in 2013 with the UK's advertising watchdog, the ASA, saw Mr Watt call the officials \"killjoy, self-important pen pushers\".\nBrewDog has also been criticised for selling some beers with exceptionally high alcohol rates, such as a limited edition ale that was 55% alcohol.\nMr Watt says that he and Mr Dickie - who together own a 75% share of the business - remain unrepentant, and simply \"make beers that we want to drink ourselves\".\nMr Watt adds that BrewDog's products are bought by beer aficionados, and priced at a premium. He says that if someone is going to abuse alcohol they will be the cheaper, mass market beers that give drinkers \"maximum bang for their buck\".\nWith exports now making up 65% of sales, Mr Watt says they have no plans to slow down the fast-paced growth.\n\"My worry is that we aren't growing fast enough,\" he says.", "summary": "When the founders of popular but controversial beer company BrewDog needed a second bank loan to enable them to expand production, their tactic was a simple one - lie through their teeth."}

{"id": "28345611", "article": "You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.\nBut Shakespeare's Globe on London's Bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.\nEverything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics\nThe Globe's site beside the River Thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor Jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.\nBuilding this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.\nFarah Karim-Cooper, one of the Globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.\nThe design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of \"informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence\".\nBut this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating \"authenticity\", says Dr Karim-Cooper. The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.\n\"We're not interested in re-enactment,\" she says.\nBut she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice. Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?\nIt was something that happened regularly in Shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor Globe to an indoor playhouse such as the Blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the River Thames.\nIt must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub. The Globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.\nThe Globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.\nAnd in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.\nLight and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era. \"Darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper.\n\"Darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick. It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\"\nShe says that if Elizabethans or Jacobeans travelled in time to modern London \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\".\nAnother big difference is that Shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.\nThe modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.\nIn the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen. The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.\nAnd one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed Globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.\n\"It was a very social occasion,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper, describing the Shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.\n\"Contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says.\nPutting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.\nFor instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says Dr Karim-Cooper.\nModern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue. When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.\nThere are other big changes between a modern and Shakespearean theatre visit.\nIt would have smelled very different, says Dr Karim-Cooper. There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.\nAnother sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says. It would have been a much softer sound, as Elizabethan London didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.\n\"In terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says. \"There are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming. They never heard a plane taking off.\"\nThe language would have sounded unusual too. The accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.\nAnd the Globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.\nThe role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.\n\"There is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do. It wouldn't work,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper.\nInstead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions. They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.\n\"We want to get beyond Wikipedia,\" she says.\nShe is co-editor of Moving Shakespeare Indoors, a collection of essays on indoor Jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the Globe's work.\nThere is a postgraduate degree course in Shakespeare Studies with King's College, London. There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.\nEvery year there is a landmark schools production, the Playing Shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for London pupils. It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see Shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.\nDr Karim-Cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.\n\"We want to become a research hub. We want students to be here.\"\nThe \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\".\n\"We don't separate the practical from the academic.\"", "summary": "When you think of a laboratory you wouldn't usually think of cheering crowds or actors in costumes."}

There may be a few entryists, he says, but only a tiny minority.\nMelvyn believes the new members may be \"naive\" in their views but they are not Trotskyists.\nIt's only a snap shot but my impression is that even those party members who are not supporters of Jeremy Corbyn are far from happy about the challenge to his leadership.\nSome regard it as a distraction from the business of opposing the Conservatives; others as undemocratic; others still as a precursor to a possible all-out civil war or even split in the party.\nThe difficulty is that Mr Corbyn has become the sticking point.\nMany Labour MPs believe he threatens Labour's very survival as a credible political party.\nBut if they are hoping the membership is poised to turn against him - I found precious little sign of it in Leeds.", "summary": "There's no disguising the confidence in Jeremy Corbyn's camp about this leadership election."}

He secured his Tour card within just four events of joining the paid ranks seven months ago.\nHaving completed a stellar college career at Arizona State, where he won the prestigious Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus awards, the youthful Spaniard was third at Congressional last year before finishing runner-up at the Canadian Open last July.\nHis rapid rise accelerated further with this victory over a strong field in California.

So to answer your question: yes, I will be joining the European Tour at some stage.\n\"I am very much a European, and I want to play there.

{"id": "29060239", "article": "Healthcare workers are visibly struggling, the response to the outbreak has been damned as \"lethally inadequate\" and the situation is showing signs of getting considerably worse.\nThe outbreak has been running all year, but the latest in a stream of worrying statistics shows 40% of all the deaths have been in just the past three weeks.\nSo what can we expect in the months, and possibly years, to come?\nCrystal-ball gazing can be a dangerous affair, particularly as this is uncharted territory.\nPrevious outbreaks have been rapidly contained, affecting just dozens of people; this one has already infected more than 3,900.\nBut the first clues are in the current data.\nDr Christopher Dye, the director of strategy in the office of the director general at the World Health Organization, has the difficult challenge of predicting what will happen next.\nHe told the BBC: \"We're quite worried, I have to say, about the latest data we've just gathered.\"\nUp until a couple of weeks ago, the outbreak was raging in Liberia especially close to the epicentre of the outbreak in Lofa County and in the capital Monrovia.\nHowever, the two other countries primarily hit by the outbreak, Sierra Leone and Guinea, had been relatively stable. Numbers of new cases were not falling, but they were not soaring either.\nThat is no longer true, with a surge in cases everywhere except some parts of rural Sierra Leone in the districts of Kenema and Kailahun.\n\"In most other areas, cases and deaths appear to be rising. That came as a shock to me,\" said Dr Dye.\nThe stories of healthcare workers being stretched beyond breaking point are countless.\nA lack of basic protective gear such as gloves has been widely reported.\nThe charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has an isolation facility with 160 beds in Monrovia. But it says the queues are growing and they need another 800 beds to deal with the number of people who are already sick.\nThis is not a scenario for containing an epidemic, but fuelling one.\nDr Dye's tentative forecasts are grim: \"At the moment we're seeing about 500 new cases each week. Those numbers appear to be increasing.\n\"I've just projected about five weeks into the future and if current trends persist we would be seeing not hundreds of cases per week, but thousands of cases per week and that is terribly disturbing.\n\"The situation is bad and we have to prepare for it getting worse.\"\nThe World Health Organization is using an educated guess of 20,000 cases before the end, in order to plan the scale of the response.\nBut the true potential of the outbreak is unknown and the WHO figure has been described to me as optimistic by some scientists.\nThe outbreak started in Gueckedou in Guinea, on the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nBut it has spread significantly with the WHO reporting that \"for the first time since the outbreak began\" that the majority of cases in the past week were outside of that epicentre with the capital cities becoming major centres of Ebola.\nAdditionally one person took the infection to Nigeria, where it has since spread in a small cluster and there has been an isolated case in Senegal.\nProf Simon Hay, from the University of Oxford, will publish his scientific analysis of the changing face of Ebola outbreaks in the next week.\nHe warns that as the total number of cases increases, so does the risk of international spread.\nHe told me: \"I think you're going to have more and more of these individual cases seeding into new areas, continued flows into Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, and all the countries in between, so I'm not very optimistic at the moment that we're containing this epidemic.\"\nThere is always the risk that one of these cases could arrive in Europe or North America.\nHowever, richer countries have the facilities to prevent an isolated case becoming an uncontrolled outbreak.\nThe worry is that other African countries with poor resources would not cope and find themselves in a similar situation to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\"Nigeria is the one I look at with great concern. If things started to get out of control in Nigeria I really think that, because of its connectedness and size, that could be quite alarming,\" said Prof Hay.\nIt is also unclear when this outbreak will be over.\nOfficially the World Health Organization is saying the outbreak can be contained in six to nine months. But that is based on getting the resources to tackle the outbreak, which are currently stretched too thinly to contain Ebola as it stands.\nThere have been nearly 4,000 cases so far, cases are increasing exponentially and there is a potentially vulnerable population in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea in excess of 20 million.\n11,315\nDeaths - probable, confirmed and suspected\n(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)\n4,809 Liberia\n3,955 Sierra Leone\n2,536 Guinea\n8 Nigeria\nProf Neil Ferguson, the director of the UK Medical Research Council's centre for outbreak analysis and modelling at Imperial College London, is providing data analysis for the World Health Organization.\nHe is convinced that the three countries will eventually get on top of the outbreak, but not without help from the rest of the world.\n\"The authorities are completely overwhelmed. All the trends are the epidemic is increasing, it's still growing exponentially, so there's certainly no reason for optimism.\n\"It is hard to make a long-term prognosis, but this is certainly something we'll be dealing with in 2015.\n\"I can well imagine that unless there is a ramp-up of the response on the ground, we'll have flare-ups of cases for several months and possibly years.\"\nIt is certainly a timeframe that could see an experimental Ebola vaccine, which began safety testing this week, being used on the front line.\nIf the early trials are successful then healthcare workers could be vaccinated in November this year.\nBut there are is also a fear being raised by some virologists that Ebola may never be contained.\nProf Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, describes the situation as \"desperate\".\nHis concern is that the virus is being given its first major opportunity to adapt to thrive in people, due to the large number of human-to-human transmissions of the virus during this outbreak of unprecedented scale.\nEbola is thought to come from fruit bats; humans are not its preferred host.\nBut like HIV and influenza, Ebola's genetic code is a strand of RNA. Think of RNA as the less stable cousin of DNA, which is where we keep our genetic information.\nIt means Ebola virus has a high rate of mutation and with mutation comes the possibility of adapting.\nProf Ball argues: \"It is increasing exponentially and the fatality rate seems to be decreasing, but why?\n\"Is it better medical care, earlier intervention or is the virus adapting to humans and becoming less pathogenic? As a virologist that's what I think is happening.\"\nThere is a relationship between how deadly a virus is and how easily it spreads. Generally speaking if a virus is less likely to kill you, then you are more likely to spread it - although smallpox was a notable exception.\nProf Ball said \"it really wouldn't surprise me\" if Ebola adapted, the death rate fell to around 5% and the outbreak never really ended.\n\"It is like HIV, which has been knocking away at human-to-human transmission for hundreds of years before eventually finding the right combo of beneficial mutations to spread through human populations.\"\nIt is also easy to focus just on Ebola when the outbreak is having a much wider impact on these countries.\nThe malaria season, which is generally in September and October in West Africa, is now starting.\nThis will present a number of issues. Will there be capacity to treat patients with malaria? Will people infected with malaria seek treatment if the nearest hospital is rammed with suspected Ebola cases? How will healthcare workers cope when malaria and Ebola both present with similar symptoms.\nAnd that nervousness about the safety of Ebola-rife hospitals could damage care yet further. Will pregnant women go to hospital to give birth or stay at home where any complications could be more deadly.\nThe collateral damage from Ebola is unlikely to be assessed until after the outbreak.\nNo matter where you look there is not much cause for optimism.\nThe biggest unknown in all of this is when there will be sufficient resources to properly tackle the outbreak.\nProf Neil Ferguson concludes: \"This summer has there have been many globally important news stories in Ukraine and the Middle East, but what we see unfolding in West Africa is a catastrophe to the population, killing thousands in the region now and we're seeing a breakdown of the fragile healthcare system.\n\"So I think it needs to move up the political agenda rather more rapidly than it has.\"", "summary": "This isn't just the worst single Ebola outbreak in history, it has now killed more than all the others combined."}

{"id": "36734108", "article": "As in much of the West Indies, cricket here is a much-loved national sport. But something's a little different about this match.\nInstead of pitching the ball, the batsman rolls it across the grass to the waiting batsman, who is kneeling on the ground - primed for action.\nBat meets ball with a satisfying whack and a cheer erupts from the small group.\nWelcome to a training session of the Guyana Blind Cricket Association.\n\"It's not that different from sighted cricket,\" says top player and board member Ganesh Singh, who has been blind since he lost his sight at the age of 17.\n\"In sighted cricket it's all about eye and hand co-ordination, here it's ear and hand co-ordination.\n\"Once you're a keen listener, you pick up the line of the ball and then you can bowl, field and bat effectively. It's very instinctive.\"\nInstead of the traditional leather-and-cork model, blind cricket uses a hollow plastic ball filled with iron beads that rattle as the ball moves, alerting players to its location.\n\"It's a very vocal game,\" explains Singh.\n\"For example, if the bowler is totally blind, the keeper will make some kind of noise behind the stumps so that the bowler can get his direction and know where to bowl the ball. There's a lot of chatter and noise.\"\nToday the chatter is particular loud, as the team excitedly wait to hear who has been picked to play at the Regional Blind Cricket T20 championship in Trinidad.\nSchemona Trinidad, who has travelled two hours from Berbice to get to the stadium - located just outside the capital, Georgetown - is not certain she will make the cut.\n\"I'm not absolutely sure. But I hope so!\" she says.\nThe 21-year-old joined the team in the B2 (or partially sighted) category but a deterioration in her vision means she's moved to B1, the category for blind players.\n\"When I started, I could see the ball a little bit, now it's a bit more challenging,\" she says.\nBut the friendly, banter-filled atmosphere makes playing less daunting.\n\"When you're out there, you have to have confidence in yourself.\n\"Some totally blind people that have just started to play are afraid to run around without a guide, but the coach and other team members are like 'Go for it! Chase the ball!' so that helps.\"\nOne of four female players on the team, Trinidad is determined to reach the top.\n\"I've heard that they're going to have a female [blind cricket] West Indies team from next year,\" she says excitedly.\nGiven that the West Indies recently won its first Women's World Twenty20 in April, the timing could not be better.\nTrinidad is not the only one to wax lyrical about the game and its off-pitch benefits.\n\"Blind cricket basically helped me to transform my life from being someone who was isolated from society, lacked self-esteem and confidence, to someone that is fully empowered,\" enthuses Singh.\nIn 2006, he and two other Guyanese cricketers, Oliver Kerr and Patrick Dillon, were part of the first West Indies team to participate in the Blind Cricket World Cup, held in Pakistan.\nThough perhaps Singh's success is no surprise, given that the village where he hails from, Unity, also produced Shivnarine Chanderpaul, former captain of the West Indies cricket team, and women's cricketer Indomatie Goordyal.\nWith another Blind Cricket World Cup set to take place in India in January 2017, the team are hoping to do well at this weekend's regional T20 championships.\nCoach Bharat Mangru is confident.\n\"This is the first season that we've had a full compliment of B3 players [those with better vision]. They're young, energetic and that feeds the other players.\n\"Over the years we went out there to compete. But I think this year our message is: Win.\"\nOne potential roadblock to success is the lack of stable financial support.\n\"Prior to a tournament or any time we need funding, we start writing letters soliciting funding from private sector and government agencies. But it's not reliable,\" says Singh.\nFor the forthcoming trip to Trinidad, they are about $1,500 (\u00c2\u00a31,150) short.\n\"But we're hoping that we can get it. We're always optimistic,\" says Singh.\nYet just as they refuse to let a little rain get in the way of their practice, the team are determined to play on.\nCoach Mangru is not surprised.\n\"In sighted cricket, the first thing some of the guys would have said is, 'Ah Coach, man! It's raining. We got to come to the ground?' But these guys called me at home from the stadium.\n\"That's the kind of commitment there is.\"", "summary": "It is a drizzly Sunday morning in Guyana, and at the National Stadium a game of cricket is in full swing."}

Failure was not an option on Broadway either.\"\nContracts with Nasa - to design radiation coating for fabrics and bits of space suits, including a pressurised elbow-and-shoulder assembly - provided Final Frontier with funding.\nAs did an agreement with zero2infinity, a Spanish company interested in exploring suborbital trips.\nBut in addition to traditional means, in June 2012 Final Frontier Design turned to crowd-funding website Kickstarter.\nUsing the $27,632 they raised on the site, they were able to build the \"3G\" suit, which is the third version of their lightweight space suit.\nMeant to be worn inside the space capsule in case of a loss of pressure, it was unveiled this summer.\nFunding is not the only challenge: Final Frontier must also deal with competitors.\nThere are the established space suit manufacturers, like David Clark and Boeing, who have a long history of providing suits for Nasa.\nThen, there are rival start-ups like Orbital Outfitters, which like Final Frontier features a founding team that includes space outsiders, such as a former Hollywood special effects artist.\nFinally, there are the in-house space suit design centres at a number of the commercial space tourism companies, such as SpaceX, which is led by Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal.\nPeter Homer, a private astronaut glove developer who started his own firm, Flagsuit (tagline: \"Fits like a glove\"), says there's more than enough room for everyone.\n\"Right now, there's not a lot of competition because there's no market,\" says Mr Homer, who is also collaborating with Orbital Outfitters.

There could be another \u00a340,000 still outstanding when fee loans are written off after 30 years.\nWhen fees start increasing from this autumn, it will mean borrowing about \u00a328,600 for three years, with the amount then rising with inflation each year.\nBut while students have battled for years over the headline figure of \u00a39,000 and now \u00a39,250, the Intergenerational Foundation says they're missing the much bigger picture of what it will really cost in repayments.\nAnd it's going to publish its findings in a report called The Packhorse Generation.\nThese extra costs start to rack up while a student is still at university, because interest is charged as soon as students start their courses, adding thousands to the debt before students have even graduated.\nStudents start paying back their fee loans once they earn more than \u00a321,000 per year - and the more they earn the more they pay each month, until the debt, plus interest, is cleared.\nSo this means total repayments can vary widely.\nThe think tank, which campaigns for fairness between generations, forecasts that:\nA more likely scenario is that a graduate would start on a lower salary and gradually progress upwards.\nAnd the think tank gives an example of someone starting out on \u00a322,000 and then rising over the years to \u00a341,000, with the projection that they would pay back about \u00a331,000 and leave a further \u00a369,000 unpaid.\nThese are not necessarily bad deals for students if it helps them into a good career.\nBut Estelle Clarke, a former City lawyer on the advisory board of the Intergenerational Foundation, argues that we're failing to understand the \"stranglehold\" of debt that we're building up for young people.\nShe also warns we should be looking nervously at the vast scale of write-offs in the current system.\nAt present the taxpayer picks up the tab for unpaid loans after 30 years, allowing graduates to walk away from tens of thousands of pounds of debt and interest charges.\n\"Taxpayers end up paying for this system twice over. Firstly, they will shoulder the burden of an economy deprived of cash as millions of graduates' incomes are diverted to loan repayments,\" says Ms Clarke.\n\"And secondly, they shoulder the burden of the non-repayment of most loans due to the extortionate ratcheting up of interest in spite of regular payments made.\"\nBut the government has long considered selling off more of the student loan book to the private financial sector.\nWould a private operator, looking hungrily at monthly repayments from millions of graduates, want more favourable terms and a bigger slice of that unpaid debt?\nMs Clarke warns that there is not nearly enough protection for students against future changes to repayment arrangements to \"extract even more cash from graduates' pockets\".\n\"No other lending has so little protection,\" she says.\nBy international standards, the only real comparison for such levels of student borrowing is the United States.\nBut as England is increasing the cost of tuition, the US has been trying to reverse out of a spiral of higher fees and higher debt.\nThis month the governor of New York announced a plan to scrap tuition fees at state universities and colleges for families earning up to $125,000 (\u00a3102,000) per year, which would help 80% of households.\nIt reflected deep-seated middle class anxieties about student debt - especially for families not rich enough to afford the fees and not poor enough to get financial support.\nThis really can be a lifetime of debt, with warnings this month of aggressive tactics from lenders trying to recover student loans from pensioners, with the over-60s in the US still owing \u00a355bn of student debt.\nUnder the Obama administration there had been growing efforts to tackle student debt.\nBut with the election of President Trump the future of student loans, now measured in the trillions, has become much less predictable.\nThe Department for Education argues that England's system is already extremely accessible, because there are no upfront costs for any students.\nInstead the costs are backloaded to be paid after graduates are working.\nAnd since graduates are likely to earn more, they can afford the cost of repayments, which in turn supports the next generation of students.\n\"The English system of student funding is sustainable, and has been recognised as such by the OECD,\" said a Department for Education spokeswoman.\n\"Critically, our system removes financial barriers for anyone hoping to study - with record numbers of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university last year.\"\nBut this is something of a turning point - with fees and debts about to begin a long upward curve.

stalwarts of the game, some of whom are updating a chat group of enthusiasts with the latest scores by mobile phone.\nFemi Solebo, Club Cricket Committee Lagos chair:\nI joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me\n\"In our time we didn't have as much exposure as the current national team does, we were restricted in playing in just the West African region,\" says Barnaby Ephraim, who now helps administer the game in Lagos.\nHe says it is the Lagos league, which was started more than 15 years ago, that has helped raise the profile of cricket and the opportunity to play it outside school and university.\nIt is also tempering attitudes that see the game as elitist and old fashioned, with some schools - even the established private ones - not seeing the sport as a priority.\nAnd Mr Solebo admits it is difficult to rival football as there are not the fans to warrant tickets that would pay for the upkeep of a turf pitch.\nThe ground the teams use is often rented out by the cash-strapped Nigerian Cricket Federation - and with upcoming elections, political rallies have recently been held here, playing havoc with the pitch, already like concrete after the dry Harmattan season.\nThe game is also expensive for players given the kit needed.\n\"With soccer, all you need is just one ball and then you're away,\" says the 45-year-old.\nBut he says whilst the league is sponsored by private individuals like him with a passion for the game, most of the 400 players in its two divisions are \"from the streets\".\nThe Ibeju Lekki club helps pay for either a player's education or vocational training - and subsidises kit and lunches.\nKunle Adegbola, Nigerian cricket captain:\nCricket is just evolving in Nigeria... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football\n\"Whatever it is they want to do, we'll fund that and insist that you can only be a member of this club if you have some kind of educational background - and that's what the other clubs try to do as well,\" says Mr Solebo, who runs a company that generates electricity.\n\"I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me.\n\"Some of them are doing very well in university, some of them have left and are working now.\"\nA few of Lagos' cricketers have even gone professional, like Nigerian cricket captain Kunle Adegbola.\nThe towering 33-year-old has come to practise for his Foundation Cricket Club in the nets ahead of a game the next day.\nWhen the season ends in April in Lagos he will head off to London, where he has played for Burgess Park and Blackheath cricket clubs in the past.\nHe says with more awareness, spectators and sponsorship, he sees great things for Nigerian cricket.\n\"Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria...  in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football,\" he says.\nBut the Lagosian cricketers know gaining such momentum will only be achieved with serious corporate sponsorship - which would be more likely if ongoing negotiations with a cable TV company bear fruit.\nSo far TV executives have been reluctant to go ahead as they would prefer a national league.\n\"But we say that we can take it in phases, adopt Lagos first and then you can open up,\" says Mr Ephraim, vice-chair of the Lagos State Cricket Association which is also trying to rejuvenate youth interest in cricket.\nHe says that unlike other states there are 35 schools in Lagos now playing cricket - with both boys and girls participating.\nIbeju Lekki player Endurance Ofem agrees junior involvement is key to putting cricket on a football footing.\nBut the former captain of the Nigerian side says offering national team players good welfare packages like those available to professional footballers is important too.\n\"If you do that, every youngster sees the reason to come and play cricket.\"\nFor Mr Solebo, competing with football is not the issue - it is the cricket that matters.\n\"It makes me very proud that our efforts give people joy every weekend - they come here, play with passion and it's fantastic.\"", "summary": "Nigeria has produced its fair share of great sportsmen and women -

{"id": "33478480", "article": "Christmas Day is the only religious holiday which is also a national public holiday, after Easter Monday was officially renamed Family Day.\nBut South Africa's Law Reform Commission argues that is unfair and says holidays from all religions should be treated equally. The commission noted that members of other religious groups do not get paid when they skip work to observing their own holidays.\nSome 80% of South Africans are classed as Christian, according to the most recent available statistics, although many combine their Christian beliefs with traditional practices.\nThe chairman of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said she supports a change.\n\"We are trying to find a middle road for the country that's not going to make people angry, that's not going to start a religious war,\" she said.\n\"But once you take Christianity alone and you give all the Christians all the happiness and give others nothing, then it's unconstitutional,\" she added.\nThe commission says that the constitutional guarantee of minority rights should extend to recognition of minority faith holidays.\nIt did not take too long before there was a push back from some Christians who were not happy with the proposal.\nThe leader of the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), Reverend Kenneth Meshoe, said that if Christmas was removed from the holiday calendar - to achieve equality -  it would imply that \"South Africans don't need God in their lives, which would have serious consequences\".\nMr Meshoe also said that if the matter came before parliament, the ACDP would lobby Christians from other parties to vote in favour of retaining Christian holidays.\nThis is not the first time the matter has been raised here in South Africa.\nIn 1994 at the end of apartheid, Ascension Day was removed as a public holiday and Easter was officially renamed Family Day, although most people still refer to it as Easter.\nTen years later the issue of holidays was discussed again by the Department of Home Affairs but it was later abandoned.\nReligion in South Africa (most recent figures)\nChristianity: 79.8%\nIslam: 1.5%\nHinduism: 1.2%\nJudaism: 0.2%\nOther beliefs: 0.6%\nNo religion: 15%\nUndetermined: 1.4%\nSource: Census 2001\nBut what has been the trend elsewhere on the continent?\nIn Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is roughly equally split between Christians and Muslims, both Christmas and the Prophet Muhammad's birthday Eid el-Maulud are national holidays.\nIn Senegal, a country I have visited many times and which enjoys one of the most harmonious relations between majority and minority groups on the continent, there is much more understanding.\nIn addition to Independence Day and Labour Day, it has numerous paid religious holidays.\nSources: wego.com; officeholidays.com; 2013 Mercer study and others\nSome 94% of the country is Muslim and so Eid al-Fitr (the end of the fasting month of Ramadan) and Eid al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice) are national holidays. Indeed, there are often two - when different sects celebrate the holidays on different days.\nBut Christmas Day, Easter and Ascension are also national holidays - and are celebrated by the 5% of the population who are Christians.\nWhile this may go some way to forging religious harmony, business leaders there complain bitterly about the loss of productivity.\nBack in South Africa, the business community is already complaining about the number of public holidays and so would not take kindly to the idea of appeasing minority groups by having any more religious holidays.\nA task team was established two years ago to look into the idea of reducing the number.\nAlthough there were some recommendations that the country could do without a couple of days holiday, it was generally accepted that comparatively, Africa's most industrialised economy was not out of kilter with the rest of the world.\nSouth Africa has 13 public holidays during the course of the year, Malaysia has 12 and the United States, Singapore and France 11.\nChristo Botes, Executive Director of Business Partners Limited, said the problem was a month like April where they are crammed together in one month, affecting productivity levels.\nSo for business, the idea is not necessarily to reduce the number of bank holidays but to spread them out in such a way to reduce their impact on the factories and other industries.\nDuring April's xenophobic attacks, some suggested that South Africa should have Africa Day on 25 May as a paid holiday, as is the case in many other countries on the continent.\nThe hope was that this would bring locals closer to the idea of an African Union ideology.\nBut no-one has raised this idea since the violence subsided.\nSo the debate about how many public holidays South Africans should enjoy looks set to rumble on.", "summary": "The number of religious holidays has come under scrutiny in South Africa, after a report suggested that minority groups were discriminated against because only Christian holidays are officially recognised."}

{"id": "32761397", "article": "There have been grumblings about whether F1 was providing enough of a spectacle for some time, but they have grown in momentum in recent weeks.\nAnd on Monday BBC co-commentator David Coulthard finally revealed to the public what many in F1 already knew - the drivers don't like the current cars because they think they are too slow and too limited by artificial restraints.\nA large part of the reason for that is down to the tyres, which was not addressed by the decisions made by the strategy group on Thursday.\nBut much has been addressed - and the answers F1's bosses have come up with would create a very different-looking sport in two years' time if they are confirmed.\nThe headline change is the return of refuelling for 2017, along with cars that will be between five and six seconds a lap faster.\nThe step-change in speed will be welcomed by drivers and fans alike - the current cars are at some tracks as much as 10 seconds a lap slower in race trim than they were in 2004.\nWith changes to aerodynamics to increase downforce and make the cars look \"more aggressive\" - wider cars, with bigger front and rear wings and wider rear tyres - and by reducing weight.\nEngines will also rev higher and be louder - addressing the complaints of some fans and F1 commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone about the new turbo hybrid engines.\nThis will be done by reducing the number of gears from eight to six, which will force teams to rev higher than the 11,000rpm or so they use now - out of a limit of 15,000rpm.\nEngineers have been tasked with finding solutions to make the engines louder, perhaps by adding another exhaust pipe.\nThat satisfies Ecclestone's demand for more noise, while retaining the hybrids, which was important to the engine manufacturers - and increasing the fuel-flow limit would have meant an expensive redesign to enable engines to cope with what would have been vastly increased power outputs in qualifying.\nThe fuel-flow limit - which has driven the engineers to develop F1 engines with thermal efficiency in excess of 40% - is also central to the development route of these engines - raise it, and they become far less relevant to current road car research.\nOn that front, these new engines have been a conspicuous success.\nOnly last weekend at the Spanish Grand Prix, Mercedes engine boss Andy Cowell was talking about how the device that recovers energy from the turbocharger - which has been criticised as unnecessary and expensive - will soon be adopted in road cars on a widespread basis.\nHaving 1,000bhp engines was discussed over the winter, but the idea of making changes to facilitate this has been quietly dropped.\nAlthough, as the best engines are about 900bhp already, it may well happen through normal development anyway.\nAll of the technical changes to cars and engines had been widely discussed for months, but the reintroduction of refuelling came out of the blue.\nReaction from fans on social media was immediate and split down the middle - some cheering it, some saying it would lead to a lack of overtaking on the track.\nBut it's not hard to see where the bosses might be coming from.\nFor one, without having to carry the maximum fuel load at any time, cars will be faster in the races from the off, taking the sting out of criticisms that they are too slow.\nLikewise, less load on the tyres means the drivers might be able to push the tyres harder - a criticism of the current situation with Pirelli, when drivers are often well within themselves for the majority of the race distance because pushing hard overheats the tyres and reduces their life.\nPirelli would have to change the tyre design for it to make any significant difference on that front, though - because the current tyres generally cannot be pushed flat out for any more than a handful of laps, no matter what the fuel load.\nIt also gives F1's bosses more flexibility when it comes to choosing which company will supply tyres after Pirelli's contract ends in 2016.\nThe drivers would love to have tyres on which they could drive flat out at all times, including throughout the race distance, as they could during the tyre war between Michelin and Bridgestone in the 2000s, and even in the years of Bridgestone as a monopoly supplier from 2007-10.\nFew have been more critical of the current tyres over the last few years than the active driver who was most successful in those pre-Pirelli years - Fernando Alonso.\nMany insiders - drivers, engineers and team bosses - will privately admit they wish Michelin would come back, for no company is regarded more highly when it comes to providing strong, consistent, grippy tyres for circuit racing.\nThat is a long shot, though.\nEcclestone made it pretty clear in an interview this week that he is not keen on a Michelin return.\nHis opinion that the French company would \"make a rock-hard tyre that you could put on in January and take off in December\" was immediately rejected as inaccurate by BBC F1 analyst Allan McNish, who raced on Michelin tyres for 18 years in sportscars and F1.\nBut Ecclestone is well known for making public statements for effect, not necessarily because they bear any relation to the truth.\nSenior sources say the reality is that the 84-year-old wants Pirelli to stay largely because of the attractive commercial terms the Italian company offers, rather than any technical or sporting reason.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nF1 will discuss what requirements it wants of its tyres come 2017. Ecclestone has already indicated to senior insiders that the new contract will almost certainly go to Pirelli again in 2017.\nWhat the return of refuelling does mean is that whoever is supplying the tyres could afford to make more durable rubber - on which drivers could push harder for longer - without that risking a reduction in pit stops.\nThis is important, because Ecclestone believes multiple pit stops are a vital element of a good F1 show.\nIntroducing refuelling will mean there will always be pit stops - and usually, although not always, more than one per driver in each race.\nThat's because of the speed advantage created by running less fuel - when every 10kg removed equates to on average 0.35secs in lap time.\nThere is one major objection to the return of refuelling - it is expensive.\nTeams will have to pay to cart all that heavy equipment around the world, a bill that may well run into the millions.\nMercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff questions that figure, but adds that the idea will be dropped if it turns out to cost too much - the big teams are not unaware of or unsympathetic to the financial burden on the smaller teams, who are already finding F1 budgets onerous.\nFor the likes of Lotus, Sauber, Force India and Manor, there was little help from the strategy group.\nNo cost-cutting measures were agreed, and bosses continue to pursue the concept of customer cars.\nBut this is only a contingency plan should some of the smaller teams fail. And the detail of what is worked out is not simply going to be Red Bull or Ferrari selling cars to smaller outfits.\nThe plan is to make it possible, should it be necessary, for some teams to buy chassis from others should they want to - and the 'selling teams' could include the likes of Williams - who operate on not much more of a budget than Force India or Lotus - as well as McLaren and Mercedes.\nOr struggling teams can continue as customers if they can make the numbers add up.\nNo-one really wants customer cars. The strategy group is simply providing the sport an option should smaller teams run out of money, whether by misfortune or mismanagement.", "summary": "The raft of potential changes to the Formula 1 rules announced on Friday amounts to a recognition that something needed to be done to answer the ever-louder questions about the health of the sport."}

{"id": "16237077", "article": "The perception that in some areas police had lost control of the streets was the most important reason disorder spread, they said.\nThe Home Affairs Committee said insufficient numbers of officers were initially deployed and police training for public disorder was inadequate.\nThe Metropolitan Police said it had outlined what it was doing to improve.\nThe Policing Large Scale Disorder: Lessons from the disturbances of August 2011 report said flooding the streets with police was what ultimately quelled the disorder.\n\"If numbers could have been increased more rapidly, it is possible that some of the disturbances could have been avoided,\" it said.\n\"We regret this did not happen and, with the benefit of hindsight, we regard the operation to police the disorder in many towns and cities, and particularly in London as flawed.\"\nIt said the mutual aid system, under which police officers are transferred to forces in need, could have operated more quickly; it may have left areas which had loaned officers to other forces \"vulnerable\".\nThe report said anecdotal evidence from some of those convicted suggested the widespread disorder started when people saw police had \"lost control\" in Tottenham via television and social media. This echoes the findings of the independent Riots Communities and Victims Panel.\n\"Clearly a feeling existed that desirable consumer goods could be made available by looting. There was a substantial element of opportunistic criminality and copycat behaviour,\" the report said.\n\"The absence of a police presence or sight of police officers apparently standing by and allowing criminal behaviour to take place was distressing for those whose homes and businesses were being attacked,\" it added.\nCommittee chairman Keith Vaz MP said: \"Individual police officers acted with great bravery, and we commend them for their actions. However, in London and other areas, in contrast with the effectiveness of police responses in some towns and cities, there was a failure of police tactics.\n\"This situation might have been avoided had police appreciated the magnitude of the task.\n\"We urgently require a rapid improvement in police training to deal with public disorder. We urge the police to act more quickly in future and to review the arrangements for loaning officers from one force to another in this type of scenario.\"\nHe said that, for those who lost their homes and businesses, \"the state effectively ceased to exist - sometimes for hours at a time\".\nMr Vaz told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the committee felt that there should have been better communication between the police and the local business community to ensure that people knew what was happening and how best to protect their livelihoods.\n\"Those areas where the chief constables had decided to take pre-emptive action and get police officers on the streets quickly were able to contain this violence much more effectively,\" he added.\nThe MPs say had more officers been deployed different tactics could have been used. The Met Police is training more police to use baton rounds and is considering buying three water cannon.\nMr Vaz said the committee did not feel water cannon would have helped police in the riots and may have caused \"even greater disorders\".\nRiots broke out in Tottenham, north London, on 6 August, two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan. Unrest spread across London and to other cities, including Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol over the following days.\nBut the committee's report said the specific causes behind the riots were still unknown.\nThe report criticised the Met Police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission over failures in communication with Mr Duggan's family, which it said made a potentially tense situation worse.\nThe committee also concluded it would be unhelpful to switch off social media during times of disorder, following claims rioters used it to organise themselves.\n\"People who made an active decision to join in the disorder could equally well have heard about it on the television as on social media,\" the report said.\nThe MPs say the government needs to urgently clarify whether the police authorities will be able to recover the \u00c2\u00a389.827m it cost to police the riots. It says the riots were an exceptional series of events at a time the authorities were being asked to make savings.\nThey also call on the government to speed up the process of reimbursing people under the Riot Damages Act.\nThe Met Police said it had already recognised and publicised some of its findings on the issues identified and what it was doing to improve.\nA spokesman said: \"This includes acknowledging that we didn't have enough officers available quickly enough to respond to the initial disorder or its subsequent unprecedented escalation. As a result we have changed our mobilisation plans.\"\nHe added that the force was reviewing how it engaged with local communities and was working with Acpo and the IPCC to ensure communication was more effective in future investigations.\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers said the report had identified issues it believed was critical to get right within current policing reforms.\n\"This includes the capacity and ability to move sufficient numbers of police officers around the country when required to protect the public from national threats,\" a spokesman said.\n\"We will continue to look at all the various reports into the disorder to examine how the police service can best respond in future to the kind of exceptional criminality seen in August.\"", "summary": "The policing operation to tackle the summer riots across England was flawed, a report from MPs has concluded."}

{"id": "34007864", "article": "But the overall national picture for GCSE grades is very similar to last year. The proportion getting A* to C grades has nudged up from 68.8% to 69%.\nThat represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries. But the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top A* and A grades - is that there is \"stability\".\nThis isn't an accident. The annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate.\nIt's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be.\nWell, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature.\nThe huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils.\nAdd to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards.\nHead teachers' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results.\nHe has warned of \"volatility\", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective.\n\"It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,\" said Mr Lightman.\nThe lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades?\nOfqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system.\nBut it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems.\nOnce there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same.\nAnother factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam.\nThis year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort.\nThere are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt.\nAnd another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds.\nBut if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nNorthern Ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in Wales.\nNot only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72%.\nEngland's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead.\nWhen these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else.\nThe scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4% achieve A* grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5%.\nIn England, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest A* grades.\nThis sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places.\nWhether or not it is going to be consolation for England's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible.\nBecause in a couple of years England's GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAnother curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term?\nIt would take another exam to answer that one.", "summary": "The results have been published for more than five million GCSE entries - which will be five million different stories of exam dreams, dramas and disasters."}

Prof Ramakrishnan said uncertainty over their status was \"really detrimental\".\n\"People can't be expected to work under those circumstances. Many of them may be considering other options and many of them may not come to the UK for that reason,\" he told BBC News.\n\"What would we do if over the next year or two if they all left?  Because these are real people with families and careers to think about, and they will be much sought after by other countries - instability could lead to a short term brain drain with us losing 16% of a highly skilled work force. These people need real reassurance about their future.\"\nProf Ramakrishnan says the government has to reassure all EU citizens, including the 30,000 academics and scientists, that their status is safe and that they will be able to continue to work regardless of what happens with the negotiations. He also called on ministers to make that commitment now.\n\"That single step alone will go a long way to reassuring the community and it will also go a long way in maintaining our image as a welcoming and open society,\" he said.\n\"This should not wait until there is a new Prime Minister. If we are not an attractive destination where people feel they will be welcome, the best will simply go somewhere else and our science will decline.\"\nEarlier, Prof Ramakrishnan's predecessor as president of the Royal Society, Prof Sir Paul Nurse said that freedom of movement has to continue in any post-Brexit negotiations for British science to thrive. It is not just that freedom of movement makes it easier to attract scientists from EU nations, he says; it is a requirement for full membership of the main European research funding body.\nUK universities currently receive 10% of their research funds from EU sources - amounting to around \u00c2\u00a31bn each year. Full participation also allows UK researchers to form valuable research collaborations and to have a say in choosing areas of research.\nIn response, the Science Minister said the UK needed to be able to keep bringing the best people to the UK - but he could not commit to any policy until at least September when a new Prime Minister is chosen by Conservative party members.\n\"We have got to look at what relationship we can establish with respect to future (funding) programmes the EU operates in the process of negotiations that will be undertaken once new leadership is in place. That is not something I can commit to today,\" Mr Johnson told BBC News.\n\"This is going to be a complex piece of work and I can't commit to a particular definition of freedom of movement for you. But it is obviously going to be important that the UK stays open to the brightest and best from the EU and from around the world.\"\nLeave campaigners have argued that many countries which are neither EU members nor have freedom of movement, receive European funding.

But there's not a lot of progress,\" she says.\nSusan Alexander's concerns in the Azelle Rodney case centred on the initial IPCC investigation, which found no significant fault with the police operation that led to her son's death and which did not lead to criminal charges against the officer involved.\nA prosecution was brought only after an inquiry, held in public in 2012, uncovered new evidence.\nIn its defence, the IPCC says it carried out an extensive investigation into Azelle Rodney's death but it was advised at the time that it was not possible to obtain some of the material which later emerged during the inquiry.\nNevertheless, there are echoes of that case in the flawed IPCC investigation into the death of Sean Rigg in south London in 2008.\nAfter fresh evidence emerged at the inquest, an external review was ordered which said the IPCC hadn't been \"robust\" enough in its inquiries.\nThe IPCC conducted a new investigation and last week, a police sergeant involved in the case was charged with perjury in relation to evidence he gave at the inquest.\nMs Shaw says even though the watchdog appears to make steps in the right direction in the immediate aftermath of a critical report, its investigations are sometimes still \"not good enough\".\n\"There's learning when there's a lot of pressure, but it doesn't seem to be an organisation that's able to sustain the learning,\" she says.\n\"It takes it on board then slips back to its old ways.\"\nIt is, of course, an enormously challenging task to maintain the confidence of families who find themselves in the most desperate of circumstances and are seeking explanations that are hard to find.\nBut the police, the subject of the complaints the IPCC examines, do not appear to be satisfied with the standard of its investigations either.\nKevin Hurley, Police and Crime Commissioner for Surrey, who served as an officer in London for 32 years, says the quality leaves much to be desired.\n\"There's a lack of competence in basic evidence-gathering,\" he says.\nOne of the key problems the IPCC has always faced is that as it strives to be independent of the police service, recruiting people from a range of professional backgrounds, it loses out on investigative skills that police have in abundance.\nIn any standard criminal case involving a fatal shooting, an unexplained death or corruption, specialist detectives would be best placed to investigate.\nBut the perception that it is the \"police investigating the police\" means that the IPCC has to limit the number of former police officers it can take.\nAbout 75 per cent of the 804 IPCC staff have no policing background -

it simply can't be done,\" he says.\nIn a statement, the IPCC says lessons from the review into the Sean Rigg case are being put into practice with improved training and guidance for staff:\n\"We have boosted our internal review and quality assurance processes as well as overseeing continuous professional development for all investigators,\" the IPCC says.\n\"In cases where we may have got it wrong, although it takes time, we are putting it right,\" it explains.\nThe issue of skills and training has become more acute as the IPCC has expanded, growing by almost 250 staff in the last year alone, with a further 200 expected to join by 2016.\nIts remit has been widened to include the investigation of all serious and sensitive police cases, in addition to its ongoing work on the Hillsborough disaster, for which there is a dedicated team.\nAnd the rising caseload has fuelled concerns about delays in completing investigations.\nIn its last annual report, the IPCC admitted: \"The increase in workload has had an impact on the timeliness of investigations.\"\n\"In 2013/14 we aimed to complete half our investigations within 157 working days [more than five months] but achieved this in just over a fifth of cases closed.\"\nLast month, the watchdog was severely criticised for announcing that it would not conduct an investigation into allegations of police brutality and misconduct during clashes with miners at the Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in 1984.\nIt had taken the IPCC two-and-a-half years to reach that conclusion.\nGavin Thomas, vice-President of the Police Superintendents Association, says his members' main gripe about the IPCC is the \"inordinate amount of time to get to a decision\" which is sometimes \"disproportionate\" to the gravity of the case.\nThe effect on officers, as they wait for findings that could affect their career and livelihood, is considerable, he says.\n\"You have a high degree of anxiety and stress. Some people's lives are on hold for an extended period of time.\"\nThe IPCC says the extra staff and resources it has been given are leading to \"benefits\", with more investigations completed than ever before.\nBut it warns: \"Even with the positive changes, the timeliness of our investigations will continue to be affected by matters outside of our control, such as waiting for key expert evidence, the co-operation of witnesses and for the conclusion of other processes such as criminal trials and inquests.\"\nTwo years ago, the IPCC's performance was heavily criticised by the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, which said it was \"woefully under-equipped\".\nLabour entered the last general election with a pledge to abolish the body that it had created and replace it with a watchdog with more teeth.\nHowever, with the extra funding, staff and responsibilities that the government has provided - the IPCC's future is secure, for the next five years at least.\nIt will, though, have to redouble its efforts to convince the doubters - on both aides of the fence - that it is up to the job.", "summary": "When the policeman who had shot dead the suspected armed robber, Azelle Rodney, in north London was cleared of murder earlier this month, an email quickly dropped into my in-box."}

The locals call it \"camanchaca\".\nThe fog is made up of minuscule drops of water which are so light they do not fall as rain.\nDuring a particularly severe drought in 1956, scientist Carlos Espinosa Arancibia had an idea.\nThe retired maths and physics professor from the University of Chile carried out a series of experiments in the highest hills near the city of Antofagasta.\nThere, he came up with the idea of the fog catcher: netting with tiny openings of approximately 1mm across to capture the tiny water droplets in the fog.\nThe droplets accumulate in the netting and form a bigger drop which eventually runs off the netting into a canal underneath.\nFrom there, it is channelled through a pipe to containers at the base of the hills, ready for use.\nAnd the research continues today.\nThe town of Pena Blanca boasts one of the biggest study centres for the fog catchers. There are six big nets in the hills overlooking the town.\nTechnical adviser Nicolas Schneider says that thanks to the fog catcher they have managed to combat the desertification of the region.\nHe says that 100 hectares now are again covered in the flora once typical for the region.\n\"We're planning to provide local families with water from the fog catcher in the near future,\" Mr Schneider says.\nAt the heart of the community is a small building which also uses water from the fog catcher: the town's small artisanal brewery.\nFog Catcher Brewery is small.

{"id": "32779300", "article": "Brandon Flowers invites the BBC into his bedroom.\nIt's an unusual start to our interview - but a camera crew is setting up in the living room of his rented London apartment.\nHe checks his hair in the mirror (\"a few grey hairs now\") and settles on the edge of the pristine white bed to talk about his new record, The Desired Effect.\nThe singer has been in the limelight for more than a decade now, as the frontman of stadium rock superheroes The Killers.\nBut despite his onstage swagger, the 33-year-old is softly-spoken and full of nervous energy, with a tendency to giggle after he speaks.\nHe confesses he'd rather be promoting this new record with his bandmates.\n\"I'm the singer in The Killers. That's what I am,\" he says.\n\"That's a big part of my identity. And I do wish that we were all here. That's the dream - a band of brothers going out to take on the world.\"\nThe Desired Effect is Flowers' second solo album - the rest of The Killers are unable, or unwilling, to keep up with his prodigious work rate.\nWhile its predecessor (2010's Flamingo) seemed like an extension of his day job, this record veers towards the melodramatic pop of the late 80s, full of orchestra hits and Phil Collins drum sounds.\nLead single Can't Deny My Love could easily fit on the soundtrack to St Elmo's Fire. And, when it appeared online in March, the response was unanimous: \"This is the record we've been waiting for Brandon Flowers to make for years\".\n\"Right when I started doing interviews, I realised I'd made The Killers' second record,\" he laughs.\n\"I mean, I made what we were supposed to do on our second album, but we never gave anybody that pleasure. We threw everyone a little bit with Sam's Town.\"\nDid he know that people wanted him to be a pop star?\n\"No,\" he replies. \"Sometimes you want to be more macho and you want the word 'rock' next to your name. But I'm not ashamed of it or anything. I love pop music. And I definitely have a knack for it.\"\nFlowers spent a year recording the album in Las Vegas and Los Angeles with producer Ariel Rechtshaid (Haim, Vampire Weekend).\nStaying true to the 1980s vibe, they enlisted Bruce Hornsby to play piano, and called in a guest appearance from Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant - who delivers a typically laconic line on the Bronski Beat-sampling I Can Change.\n\"I just texted Neil with the line and within minutes I got a voice memo,\" Flowers says.\n\"We just stuck it right on the computer. It's cool. Incredible. He didn't even hear the song or the tempo or anything. It just worked.\"\nBut the sessions weren't entirely smooth.\n\"Ariel had a big job, because he's used to going in with people who are just starting out,\" Flowers explains diplomatically.\n\"I always have a lot of ideas and my demos have a really strong identity. So he had to take it and bring it into his world and pray that we both liked it.\n\"Sometimes he maybe went a little bit too far.\"\nRechtshaid was nearly fired \"four times\", says the singer, \"but it was mostly over scheduling. He's a sought after guy right now, and I want all the attention!\"\nFlowers grew up in America's Southwest. The youngest of six children, he was born in Las Vegas and moved to Utah aged eight when his father became a Mormon.\nHis elder brother educated him in music, giving him cassettes of British indie bands like New Order and The Cure; and aged 16 he moved back to Las Vegas to live with an aunt, playing keyboards in a group called Blush Response while working as a bellhop.\nWhen the band abandoned him and moved to LA, he stayed behind, answering an advert placed in a local paper by guitarist Dave Keuning.\nInspired by an Oasis gig, they decided to form a group that placed as much emphasis on guitar as the synthesizer. Naming themselves The Killers after a fictional band in a New Order video, they wrote Mr Brightside almost immediately - propelling them to international stardom.\nIt was a big change for the frontman, whose previous ambition had been to get a job as a car valet.\n\"That was the top of the ladder,\" he laughs. \"I was working in restaurants and I was a bellman at a hotel and I worked on a golf course. I loved working for tips. It was exciting. And the upper echelon, the top shelf of that in Las Vegas is the valet parkers. They make a lot of money.\"\nHe's still connected to that world - writing songs about life on the breadline and the struggle to keep love alive in hard times.\nThose fears are crystallised on the track Between Me and You, where Flowers observes a fractured home life, singing:  \"chasing every dollar - is that what I was born to do?\"\n\"I really wanted to represent men in this song, and the pressure that is placed on you to provide and lead your family,\" he says.\n\"I don't have to worry about that - but I'm definitely not far removed from people that do.\"\n\"So I'm speaking about problems I see with people that are around me. I try to take it all in, then you squeeze the sponge and the song comes out.\"\nFlowers says the general theme of The Desired Effect is \"growing up\" after a decade on the road.\nHe gave up alcohol nearly eight years ago after recommitting to Mormonism, and spends his days off raising his three young children - cooking barbeques in the back garden and doing the school run.\n\"I'm a late bloomer but I'm definitely an adult now,\" he says. \"It takes a while.\"\nWhat does he make of Bono's assertion that rock stars remain frozen at the age they became famous?\n\"I think it can be a wonderful thing - being young at heart and all of that - but it can also be terrible,\" he muses.\n\"You meet people you assume are full-blown grown ups but they've been millionaires since they were 19 because they're in big bands and they act like they're 19. I've witnessed that and I don't want to be like that. I hope that I have grown.\"\n\"I'm happy. I'm happy to be on this earth.\"\nThe Desired Effect is out now on Virgin EMI.", "summary": "The Killers' frontman Brandon Flowers has won rave reviews for his new album - but he tells the BBC he's uncomfortable striking out on his own."}

Just recently, official buildings in Kostyantynivka have been taken over, Western military monitors detained, peaceful demonstrators in Donetsk attacked, and now the regional administration building in Luhansk has been seized.\nIt is difficult to say what their ultimate goal is.

The militants have called on Moscow to intervene on more than one occasion.\nIn a speech at the Atlantic Council in Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry told the Kremlin to \"leave Ukraine in peace\" and warned: \"Nato territory is inviolable we will defend every single inch of it.\"\nIn other developments on Tuesday:\nMoscow has said it has no intention of invading eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia activists have seized government buildings in more than a dozen towns and cities.\nUntil now, only the local office of the State Security Service (SBU) in Luhansk, a city of 465,000 people less than 30km (20 miles) from the Russian border, had been targeted.\nBut on Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of people shouting \"Russia, Russia\" gathered outside the headquarters of the regional government to demand a referendum on greater autonomy.\nA group of men armed with sticks and metal bars broke into the building.

We haven't introduced this to hurt or to harm disabled people.

It is a perfectly able offroad vehicle, even when faced with fairly serious challenges.\nAnd with most of its offroad capabilities controlled by electronics, such as an adaptive damping system, it is also much smoother in the rough, with little room for human error by the button-pressing iPad generation that is expected to be buying it.\nThat prompts the question: redesign or no redesign, is the Defender quite simply obsolete?\n\"It's very long in the tooth,\" acknowledges Mr Edwards, though he nevertheless insists the Defender remains relevant.\n\"It's very important that we don't forget Land Rover and its capability. We are working very hard on the non-Range Rover badge products in our range.\n\"Replacing [the Defender] is going to be quite a challenge, but also an opportunity,\" says Mr Edwards. \"But we're definitely doing it.\n\"We'll want to replace the car as it currently occupies the market. We certainly don't want to move it upmarket and become a sort of 'Range Rover Defender'. That doesn't work at all.\"\n\"One of our problems in the past looking to replace the Defender has been to get the business case together,\" observes managing director Mr Green. \"Military contracts are fine, but you might get 5,000 orders one year, 200 the next.\"\nA more promising market might be in developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, where working vehicle sales are booming in parallel with rapid economic growth that is predicted to continue for decades yet.\nTo succeed in these markets, a new Defender will need to be able to compete on both price and quality. It will  need to be both cheaper - so the cost of production will need to come down - and better, in terms of both capabilities and fuel economy.\nAnd that may well prove an even trickier challenge than the creation of an urban warrior with designer looks.", "summary": "The Land Rover Defender has become an automotive icon, remaining largely unchanged since the first Land Rover was introduced in 1948, before going on to enjoy sales of more than two million around the world."}

But in April 2016 it went further, pushing both main parties out of the running for the presidency.\nThe FPOe candidate, Norbert Hofer, won the first round of Austria's presidential election in April and then secured around half the vote in the run-off vote on 22 May. The result was so tight, it was not immediately clear if he had won.\nThe president's role is largely ceremonial. But Mr Hofer's score reflected widespread voter frustration with immigration and the political establishment. Hundreds of thousands of migrants poured through Austria last year hoping to settle in Germany. Some 90,000 people applied for asylum in Austria itself - 1% of the population.\nWhen the late Joerg Haider led the party it achieved its best ever result in 2000 and entered the government, causing enormous tension with EU partners.\nEuropean Parliament seats (MEPs): 4\nFar right tops presidential vote\nAustria sets asylum cap\nFar-right party ELAM entered parliament for the first time in May 2016 elections, securing two seats from voters stung by the island's acute financial crisis in 2013.\nAffiliated to Golden Dawn in Greece which many observers see as neo-Nazi, ELAM has held demonstrations against Turkish Cypriots and migrants.\nIt opposes the idea of reunifying an island divided since Turkey invaded the north in 1974 in response to a Greek-inspired military coup.\nDenmark's immigration rules are among the toughest in Europe - reflecting the power of the Danish People's Party (DPP), which came second in last year's general election.\nIts 21% of the vote was a record for the party, and now the ruling coalition depends on DPP support in parliament.\nThe Eurosceptic DPP also won Denmark's European Parliament election in 2014 by a wide margin, with 27% of the vote.\nThe DPP opposes multiculturalism, as do nationalists in the rest of Scandinavia, where centre-left social democracy no longer dominates in the way it did for decades.\nDenmark became a target of Muslim anger in 2005 when Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.\nControversially Denmark has given its police the authority to seize valuables worth more than 10,000 kroner (\u00c2\u00a31,045; $1,514) from refugees to cover housing and food costs.\nThe government has also cut migrant benefits and put adverts in Lebanese newspapers warning against migration to Denmark.\nMEPs: 3\nAnti-EU Danish party gets big boost\nDenmark backs seizing migrants' assets\nThe nationalist Finns Party (previously the \"True Finns\") came second in last year's general election.

Marine famously got him expelled from the FN in a family feud last August.\nThe FN has two seats in the French National Assembly (parliament) and in 2014 won the French European Parliament election, taking 25% of the vote.\nMarine Le Pen is anti-EU, rejecting the euro and blaming Brussels for mass immigration, because of the Schengen free-movement policy.\nIn 2010 she told FN supporters that the sight of Muslims praying in the street was similar to the Nazi occupation in World War Two.\nThe Islamist attacks on Paris in January and November, which nearly 150 people were murdered, raised alarm about jihadists taking advantage of Europe's open borders.\nMEPs: 21\nLe Pen condemns 'campaign of lies'\nAnti-EU MEPs form nationalist bloc\nGerman politics has been shaken up by Alternative for Germany (AfD), a right-wing party launched in 2013 by economists opposed to the euro.

But today its emphasis is less on secession, more on boosting the northern regions' autonomy and paying less tax to the central government.\nThe influx of migrants from North Africa has put a severe strain on Italy's asylum infrastructure and revived the fortunes of the Northern League.

In Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, says Mr Moran, \"you still have wide open areas of wilderness and desert where people are able to get across\".\nThat is if they don't die trying.\nDonald Trump reckons he has the answer - a \"beautiful\" wall spanning all four states which abut Mexico. It is a plan which goes down well with the men and women on the front line.\nAs vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, Mr Moran is union spokesman for 17,000 border agents who are, collectively, supporting the presumptive Republican nominee for president of the United States.\n\"Mr Trump seems to be the only candidate that's actually talking about border enforcement and fixing the immigration laws of the United States,\" says Mr Moran.\n\"This is a country built on the rule of law and over the past few decades we have carved out entire sections of our immigration laws and just ignored them. President Obama has just thrown out enforcement.\"\nIt is certainly true that the United States has looked the other way for many years as millions of illegal migrants set up home, although the question of enforcement is complex.\nAny Mexican you ask in California will tell you they are there to work - often as builders, nannies, farmhands and cleaners, propping up the American economy, they say.\nMr Trump, in contrast, accuses immigrants of costing the US billions of dollars in education, healthcare, housing and welfare as well as of committing crimes and putting Americans out of work.\nTrump wants to deport every illegal immigrant - could he?\nWhy Mexicans are troubled by Trump\nNaming the people who die in the desert\nShopping for a perilous journey\nIt is this potent mix of nationalism and protectionism which is animating his supporters in this angriest of elections.\nAnd so Mr Trump wants to throw out every single undocumented immigrant. They would later be allowed to reapply for legal entry, he says, as long as they paid a hefty fee.\nIt is, by definition, difficult to count people living in the shadows and the numbers are therefore contested, but research estimated the number of unauthorised immigrants inside the United States in 2014, from all countries, at 11.3 million.\nExactly how they would be expelled and how much it would cost is, as with so much of Mr Trump's policy platform, not at all clear.\nThe tycoon-turned-politician has though given a sliver of detail about the \"beautiful\" wall he says he would build along the 1,989 mile border.\nMexico, he says, would pay for its construction or else Mexicans in the US would be prevented from sending money back to their families.\nA Trump White House would \"impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages,\" according to the presidential contender's website.\nThat is no small threat - remittances from all Mexicans abroad were worth $24.8bn in 2015 according to the Bank of Mexico, more than the country's oil revenues - but could it be done?\n\"Is Trump going to steal the money,\" asks the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox Quesada, incredulously. \"How can any human being think like that? It's incredible!\n\"It's not going to happen,\" he tells the BBC. \"Forget it. We're not going to pay for that [expletive] wall!\"\nThis sentiment is echoed in Tijuana itself, often in similarly robust language.\nMr Trump's description of Mexican immigrants as killers and rapists hasn't done much for his popularity here - an ugly mural with the caption \"Rape Trump\" adorns the border wall on the southern side - and in the colourful markets where Trump pi\u00c3\u00b1atas (papier mache effigies filled with sweets which children whack open at birthday parties) are selling like hot tacos, they have a wary eye on the superpower nextdoor.\nBeating the American businessman with a stick is popular, it seems.\n\"People are worried by everything he's saying about Mexico and Mexicans,\" says Carmen Espinoza, in Spanish, behind the counter of her shop which has just one Trump pi\u00c3\u00b1ata left.\n\"We're not criminals, we're nothing like that. We are hardworking people who simply want to find work. Don't vote for him!\"\nOf course some Mexican immigrants are criminals and in the past few years many have faced deportation from the US.\nIn fact, President Barack Obama has reportedly deported more illegal immigrants than any president before him, although critics say that number has fallen sharply during his second term.\nAs a result, across Tijuana we find what could be the scene from another Donald Trump dream - a room full of freshly deported \"illegals\".\nIn this half-way house for new arrivals - the Casa del Migrante, a Christian mission which offers shelter, legal advice and psychological support - they're serving dinner.\nFor some of the men and women here this is the first real taste of Mexico since they were children.\n11.3 million\nEstimated unauthorised immigrants in the US\n235,413 Number of people US Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"removed or returned\" in 2015\nVictor Manuel Perez Monroi, who lived in Spokane, Washington, from the ages of six to 61, is typical.

They would go bankrupt.\"\nMr Perez is not the only one here struggling with his new life. Other migrants tell similar stories of infractions, minor and major, which resulted in their deportation and, often, in the potential of permanent separation from their families.\nLooking across at Tijuana from the US side, is the border patrol agent Shawn Moran sympathetic?\n\"Oh, yes,\" he insists. \"If I was in the same situation, I would try to get my family out of there and go somewhere where I could make some money and give them a better way to live.\n\"But we have a system in place for that.

This isn't something NHS England will be advocating when it rolls out the test to high-risk women next year, but it is already big business for some private clinics in the UK.\nMost private NIPT providers offer their tests to women through hospitals and healthcare clinics, although some clinics are located in retail chains on High Streets.\nNIPT is also available on some websites for women to order directly.\nThe Nuffield Council, which advises on ethical issues, says the information currently offered to women and couples accessing NIPT outside the NHS can sometimes be poor and incomplete.\nIt says some providers are not telling women enough about the limits of the test.\nAdvertising by clinics can fail to point out that NIPT can vary in its accuracy, and that it may give a reading that turns out to be false.\nThis is important because women use the test result to decide whether to have more risky, invasive diagnostic tests that pose a chance of miscarriage.\nThe report says there have been instances where the NHS was \"left to pick up the pieces\" after women had been told that they had a high chance of carrying a baby with a genetic disease based on their NIPT result but had not been given sufficient follow-up.\nOne woman who used a private testing service told the Nuffield Council: \"My results were delivered via a telephone call on a Friday teatime.

That's one way to erase the memory of an Olympic dream crushed.\n\"I remember I had a gap on my competitors and was thinking, 'OK, it's not necessary to go crazy going downhill',\" the 33-year-old Dutchwoman, who was leading the road race in Rio when the crash took place, tells BBC Sport.\n\"Then it started to rain a little bit, so I was actually extra careful. But the corner surprised me and I didn't take it properly. Next thing I remember I was awake in a hospital bed and I had my mother on the phone.\"\nBack in the Netherlands, poor Mrs Van Vleuten had been watching the race on her birthday. The agony these elite athletes put their parents through. Then again, what about us viewers - that wasn't what we were expecting when we switched on the TV expecting some wholesome sporting entertainment.\nAnd what about her poor team-mates - when Anna van der Breggen rounded the bend, she thought Van Vleuten might be dead. This being the Olympics, Van der Breggen didn't think of stopping but rode on to win the gold instead.\nBut this interview didn't take place from said hospital, or even a different one in the Netherlands. Two weeks after the crash that was heard around the world, Van Vleuten was on her bike again. Never mind the three fractures in her back, the severe concussion, the worried mum, there were other races to be won.\n\"The first week I was really struggling with the idea that I was going for gold and made that stupid, stupid mistake. But then I realised that thinking like this was not going to help me feel better. So I started making some new goals.\n\"The three vertebrae were not broken in a dangerous place in my back, only on the side, and I never had serious symptoms of the concussion. And as a cyclist you're used to crashing at least once or twice a year, it's part of the job.\"\nAlmost a month to the day after her Olympic hopes hit the skids, Van Vleuten won her first stage, the Belgium Tour prologue. Three days later, Van Vleuten clinched the overall title with a stirring solo effort on the final stage.\n\"It's sort of a miracle but I sort of expected it,\" said Van der Breggen, apparently a difficult woman to stir. \"She is really tough. That is Annemiek.\"\nA tough talker, too. Asked how she felt when she heard Britain's Lizzie Deignan (nee Armitstead) had been cleared to compete in the Olympic road race, having missed three drug tests in a year, Van Vleuten goes for the jugular.\n\"I was angry about it because the rules are for everyone and you cannot make exceptions. It's part of the job, you have to take it seriously. It's very special to miss three tests in one year, a really big achievement. Maybe because she's the world champion they made an exception for her but I don't think that's fair.\"\nVan Vleuten is similarly outspoken on the subject of inequality in cycling, advocating that every men's race should have a women's equivalent.\n\"What would help is if we had more time on television. That would help to get more sponsors and more people to watch and enjoy it. The [women's] Rio road race was a good example of that, it was at the same level as the men's race.\"\nAt the current rate, equality will arrive in cycling long after Van Vleuten has pedalled her last and hung her bikes up. Female cyclists earn a fraction of what male cyclists pull in and the chance to ride one day of the Tour de France is little more than a patronising pat on the head from the cycling authorities.\nBut just as Van Vleuten doesn't like to look over her shoulder, she doesn't like to look too far forward. It makes a lot of sense, given what happened in Rio.\n\"After the London Olympics I wasn't only thinking of Rio. Cycling has a lot of nice races, like the Tour of Flanders [which Van Vleuten won in 2011 and Armitstead this year], which is a super-beautiful race to win.

Expected to compete against the clock in temperatures pushing 40C, it's good that she can look on the bright side.\n\"It's hard for me to do interviews that always want to talk about the crash because it's something I've accepted and I don't want to look back at that.\n\"I prefer to think about the part before, the part when I was going uphill and riding so excellent, better than I ever did.

I warmly welcome Hitachi as a major new player in the UK energy sector,\" he said.\nBy Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter, BBC News\nHitachi's acquisition of Horizon Nuclear Power marks the start of a journey.\nThe Japanese company says it wants to invest billions of pounds and create thousands of jobs in the UK, as it helps combat predicted energy shortages in the years ahead.\nBut no firm investment commitment will be forthcoming until the government comes up with a minimum price for nuclear power.\nAnd if that price turns out to be too low, there is no guarantee that Hitachi will go ahead with its plans.\nNuclear deal still faces hurdles\nUK engineering companies Babcock International and Rolls-Royce have signed preliminary contracts to join the Hitachi deal, which the Japanese company said should be completed by the end of November.\nThere will then be regulatory issues to clear, but once Hitachi's reactor design is approved by the necessary authorities the company intends to build 6 gigawatts of nuclear capacity, with the first plant generating power in the first half of the next decade.\nUp to 6,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction at each site, thousands more in the supply chain, and a further 1,000 permanent jobs at both locations once operational.\nThe Horizon venture, based at Brockworth, Gloucester, currently employs about 90 people and was set up in 2009 as part of the drive to meet the UK's carbon reduction goals and secure energy demand as old power plants are decommissioned.\nBut RWE and E.On put the business up for sale in March after Germany's move to abandon nuclear power in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster.\nA consortium made up of EDF and British Gas-owner Centrica has maintained its interest but the two companies have still to decide whether to build two reactors at Hinckley Point, Somerset.\nCompanies involved in the nuclear industry have expressed caution over entering the UK market. Because of the huge capital costs, stretched over many years, companies want some certainty over how much they might be paid for the electricity generated by their plants.\nLast week, the chief executive of EDF, Vincent de Rivaz, told MPs that his company needed safeguards from the government that the finances of future nuclear deals would be \"fair\".\nDelays over decision-making and financing have led to doubts that new power capacity will come on stream before existing plants go offline. A so-called \"energy gap\" is likely to lead to rising prices and a greater dependency on gas imports.\nEarlier this month, the energy regulator Ofgem warned that the UK risks running out of energy generating capacity in the winter of 2015-16. Its report predicted that the amount of spare capacity could fall from 14% now to only 4% in three years.\nHowever, the government said that its forthcoming Energy Bill would ensure that there was secure supply.\nWith so many uncertainties still to be resolved, investment in the UK nuclear sector was still a \"leap of faith\", said George Borovas, head of nuclear projects at global law firm Pillsbury. So, he said, Hitachi's decision was a \"significant... vote of confidence in the UK nuclear programme\".\nHitachi's proposed facilities will use its advanced boiling water technology, which is already used in four reactors in Japan. Mr Borovas said this technology was a \"proven success\", adding: \"This should be very helpful with respect to its licensing in the UK and also opens up the possibility of significant export credit agency and commercial financing from Japan.\"\nEnergy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said: \"Hitachi bring with them decades of expertise, and are responsible for building some of the most advanced nuclear reactors on time and on budget, so I welcome their commitment to helping build a low-carbon, secure-energy future for the UK.\"\nShadow energy secretary Caroline Flint called on the government to use this as an opportunity to encourage investment in nuclear research and design.\nUnions also welcomed Hitachi's move, with Mike Clancy, general secretary designate of Prospect, saying: \"The Horizon venture is an important milestone in securing future low-carbon energy generation capacity within the UK and its importance to local and national economies cannot be overstated.\n\"While Hitachi's advanced boiling water reactor design has yet to undergo the UK's generic design assessment approval process, it is a proven technology and therefore any construction in the UK will benefit from lessons learned from its construction in Japan.\"", "summary": "The UK's nuclear expansion plans have been boosted after Japan's Hitachi signed a \u00c2\u00a3700m deal giving it rights to build a new generation of power plants."}

Foreign tourist numbers were up almost 40% in the April to June period of this year - in contrast exports fell by more than 5% during the same time.\nANZ Bank says tourism is the only sector driving growth in Thailand at the moment and that \"a loss of momentum in the sector will present a new downside risk to economic activity\".\nRatings agency Standard and Poor's added the \"attack has increased uncertainties over political stability and will put additional pressure on near-term economic prospects\".\nThat's the last thing Thailand needs. Most analysts say growth prospects could be hit hard if the government doesn't act decisively and show it's in control of the situation.\nAlso key will be whether there are any further attacks.

By the middle of the previous century, most of the lowland areas, particularly in south Wales, were under English control, in the form of Anglo-Norman barons from the Marches and across Glamorganshire to Pembroke.\nGwynedd and the north-west of Wales remained largely independent. Welsh princes acknowledged the ruler Llywelyn the Great and his successor Llywelyn ap Gruffudd as the overarching Prince of Wales. But as the century wore away, and Edward I of England came to power, the balance of power changed as Llywelyn refused to pay tribute to Edward.\nIn 1276 Edward I led an invasion into Gwynedd and forced Llywelyn into the very top corner of the country, and set about his castle-building programme. An uprising in 1282 led to renewed fighting, and saw the death of Llywelyn. By the following year it was over, and English domination over Wales was entrenched. Edward's son, the future Edward II, was created Prince of Wales.\nAt the start of the 1200s, Welsh was the language of the common people.\nIt was how people did business, conducted family life and worshipped. By the end of the century, daily business was increasingly done in English.\nEnglish settlers were encouraged to move to Wales by free land grants and the imposition of English law.\nAs the settlers moved into the more fruitful lowlands, Welsh speakers were increasingly pushed to the higher ground, although there was crossover between the two.\nOne of the main changes through the course of the 13th Century was the difference in the way people paid for things.\nAccording to Dr Mark Redknap, head of collections and research in the history department at the Museum of Welsh Life, the old system of \"render\" was starting to change.\n\"It's fair to say that from about the end of the 13th Century the Welsh were more familiar with using money than they had been a century earlier,\" he said.\n\"You had an increasing use of coinage whereas there is very much a barter economy with the pre-Norman period, and payment in kind.\"\nHe said taxes to the English king were paid in cash. Coinage though was still more at the stage where the actual weight of the coins, in silver for example, was what provided the value rather than a nominal amount printed on the coin.\nAs well as tithes paid to the church, Llywelyn had tried to levy tax on cattle and in lieu of military service. But it was Edward I who pushed formalised tax collection.\nBy the time of his death in 1307, tax revenue from Wales had tripled.\nAccording to Gerald of Wales, the Welsh were a militaristic society, more concerned with learning to fight rather than ploughing their land more than necessary.\nBut this only applied to free men: about a third of the population at the start of the century were bonded to a lord and worked for them on large estates.\nThe common people wore simple clothes: a tunic and thin cloak.\nAlthough much of Wales was rural, with large forests being an important source of food and resources for many, fledgling towns had been established by the Normans in places like Carmarthen and Cardiff and by the end of the century there were around 90 small towns, although few had populations over 1,000.\nIt is worth remembering that the population of Wales was tiny in comparison to now, with the whole population equivalent to modern-day Cardiff.\nSources: BBC History; St Fagans National History Museum; The People of Wales ed Gareth Elwyn Jones and Dai Smith", "summary": "As the Welsh government publishes plans to reintroduce Welsh taxes for the first time since the 13th century, BBC News looks at what life was like in Wales last time there was direct Welsh taxation."}
{"id": "33155628", "article": "And even one of those three times  - when it bought 250 million chocolate selection boxes from Woolworths following its  collapse - was a deliberate ploy to attract the retailer's customers to its stores.\nIt's a story that reflects just how Poundland, despite the cheap and cheerful image,  is a tightly managed business.\nPoundland might look a bit basic - the ultimate in pile-it-high, sell-it-cheap - but this is a sophisticated firm with big plans for expansion. And its growth is part of a wider UK success story: the unstoppable rise of the discount retailers.\nOverall, the discount sector - including Poundland and its smaller rivals such as Poundworld and Poundstretcher, as well as the  fast-growing supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl - has grown 48% over the past five years, according to retail research firm The Local Data Company.\nThis compares to the slower 34% expansion of the big four supermarket chains - Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury - over the same period.\nIn fact, last year discount stores grew twice as fast as the big four supermarkets with each chain opening an average of 33 shops compared to the 16 opened by each of the bigger players.\nThis growth in a much improved economy seems surprising, but analysts believe the recession started a much more fundamental shift.\nMaureen Hinton, global research director for retail research firm Conlumino, says the careful habits initially borne of necessity have now become entrenched, with people realising they don't have to pay a lot to get good quality products.\nShe also credits the straightforward everyday pricing strategy of the discounters, compared to the \"opaque\" costs of their bigger rivals for their continuing popularity.\n\"There's a genuine honesty with pound stores. People have discovered there's the opportunity to buy good stuff at low prices so why pay more?\" she says.\nPoundland's customer data backs this up. Far from a shop just for people struggling to make ends meet, it claims to have successfully converted the middle class with a quarter of its customers now from the \"AB\" demographic - the wealthier end of the population.\nThe discounters are also benefitting from a backlash against their bigger rivals: they're are seen as a welcome outsider, says Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London.\n\"The cheap environment, low staffing and basic shop fit outs all help. People think there's no danger here and let their guard down,\" he says.\nAnd conversely, because customers believe that there's no hidden agenda they spend more.\n\"The no gimmicks, no frills, 'here we are saving money' message means people buy a lot more just because no one is trying to convince them to do it,\" he adds.\nIn reality, he says people overestimate their ability to understand pricing, with the low pricing creating \"a level of euphoria and excitement\" that interferes with rational decision making, with \"bargain\" signs helping to create a sense of urgency.\n\"We are hardwired to feel more euphoric, the hunter gatherer instinct pushes us to buy with our shopping driven by missing out rather than acquiring what we need.\"\nTo take advantage of this, most of the discount stores stock a smaller constantly changing range on top of standard staples.\nChris Edwards, the boss of Poundworld, says its bestselling products  are \"everyday grocery items\", including baby wipes, crisps and chocolate.\nBut he says the chain, which has 280 shops nationwide, each week changes 500 of the 5,000 items it stocks to \"keep up with trends\", such as a range of Minions products to tie in with the forthcoming film release, and give customers \"new and exciting offers\".\nThe chain has also recently launched an online shop, aimed at expanding its reach.\nPoundland's Mr McCarthy says it is \"reasonably well advanced\" with similar plans, but it is also aiming to rapidly expand its physical presence.\nIt is using the funds from last year's \u00c2\u00a3750m flotation on the London Stock Exchange to open more stores with a bullish long term target of opening 1,000 UK stores up from its current network of over 500 stores across the UK and Ireland.\nA \u00c2\u00a355m deal to buy smaller rival 99p Stores and convert their shops into Poundlands, which is currently being reviewed by The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), would dramatically hasten its growth.\nAnd in contrast to what you'd expect, Mr McCarthy says the \"good times\" are actually much better for sales.\n\"We've been going for 25 years and seen two recessions. In good times people feel more confident and go on more shopping trips which means we get more business\".\nHe is equally upbeat about the firm's growth prospects, pointing to the success of US discount chain Dollar Tree, which has been going for half a century, for proof of Poundland's potential longevity.\nBut others are less certain, warning that the growth of the discounters has an obvious limit. \"If there are five pound shops on the high street, people are not going to spend five times as much. They are in danger of reaching a peak,\" warns Ms Hinton.\nStill, it remains hard to resist the lure of the bargain. Mr McCarthy admits that even he is not immune to the store's charms - describing it as a \"Pandora's box treasure trove\".\nHe buys phone charges, Toblerone chocolate bars and biographies. \"It's very difficult not to be compelled to buy,\" he says.", "summary": "During his nine years at the helm of Poundland, says chief executive Jim McCarthy, the discount chain has sold a product at a loss just three times."}

{"id": "40708043", "article": "Developing pharmaceutical drugs is a very expensive and time-consuming business. And as AstraZeneca found out last week, disappointing drug trials can knock millions off your stock market value in a flash.\nSo the faster we can identify promising molecules that could be turned into viable drugs, the better.\nThis is why pharmaceutical companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Merck, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson, are now turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help them.\nProf Andrew Hopkins is chief executive of Exscientia, an AI-based drug discovery firm that has recently signed a \u00c2\u00a333m deal with GSK.\nHe claims that AI and human beings working together in so-called \"centaur teams\" can help identify candidate molecules in a quarter of the usual time and at a quarter of the cost.\nIn Greek mythology, the centaur was half human, half horse - and very powerful and fast as a result. AI is giving scientists such extra powers, Prof Hopkins believes.\nSuccessful drug discovery relies on precise understanding of how a disease affects our biological systems, says Pamela Spence, global life sciences industry leader at consultancy firm EY.\n\"Once that is known, scientists then search for molecules that can selectively interact with this 'target' and reverse that disruption or slow its impact - a 'hit' molecule,\" she explains.\nScientists often talk of a disease as the target and the molecule as a weapon being fired a it.\nBut this process of drug discovery - traditionally carried out by small teams of scientists painstakingly testing each potential target and hit molecule in the hope of finding a winner - is an enormously time-consuming approach that also has a very high failure rate.\nSo bringing in AI is like having a research assistant who can solve problems by systematic and relentless search at incredible speeds, she says.\n\"What might work - and equally importantly what might not work - can be identified first by the AI supercomputer 'in silico',\" she says.\nThis is the medical term for research carried out by computer, as opposed to \"in vitro\" - think test tubes - and \"in vivo\" - testing on animals and humans.\nAs carrying out human clinical trials accounts for the vast bulk of drug discovery cost, the sooner we can identify when something isn't going to work, the less money will be wasted.\n\"Then the physical testing can be done on a smaller number of potential new medicines... and a much higher success rate can be achieved,\" says Ms Spence.\nExscientia's AI algorithm crunches masses of data, from the structure of diseases to the efficacy of existing drugs, from peer-reviewed studies to observations of slides under a microscope.\nAnd all these possibilities are narrowed down in a process Prof Hopkins likens to natural selection.\n\"We're not trying to rule out the uncertainty - this is messy, dirty data,\" he says. \"There are very interesting analogies between how human creativity works and evolution.\"\nThe aim is to come up with small molecules as candidates for up to 10 disease-related targets that can then be put through clinical tests.\n\"Every pill you make might cost pence to manufacture, but it's actually a precision-engineered product,\" says Prof Hopkins, who is also chair of medicinal informatics at the UK's Dundee University.\n\"There's an almost infinite number of other molecules it could have been. You have to make decisions as to what one might be safe and efficacious,\" he says. \"Most don't lead to anything.\"\nThis AI-driven approach also makes it easier to come up with molecules that can have two distinct targets. For example, a cancer drug could also improve the immune system as well as tackle the disease.\nGSK is getting behind the idea and has recently set up a discovery performance unit focused on enhancing drug discovery through the use of \"in silico\" technology - including AI, machine learning and deep learning.\nThe drive is being led by John Baldoni, GSK's head of R&D.\n\"We have a number of these deals that we are putting in place; the one with Exscientia is probably the one that's furthest along, but we have a few others in flow and a few internal projects ourselves,\" he says.\n\"The cost of discovery from target to launch is roughly $1.7bn [\u00c2\u00a31.3bn]. The cost of what we're talking about here, from target to clinic, is about 33% of that, and it takes about five-and-a-half years.\n\"Our goal is to reduce that to one year, and reduce the cost commensurate with that.\"\nAI is also finding its way into other aspects of the drug discovery process.\nBenevolent AI, for example, uses natural language processing to sift through published literature, such as chemical libraries, medical databases and scientific papers, to draw conclusions about possible new drug candidates.\nEarlier this year, one of its candidates for a drug to treat motor neurone disease - also known as ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) - was found to prevent the death of motor neurones in cells taken from real patients, and delayed the onset of the disease in animals.\n\"We are incredibly encouraged by these findings,\" says Benevolent AI founder and chairman Ken Mulvaney.\nPatients should be encouraged, too. AI-based drug discovery promises to bring more effective, cheaper drugs on to the market much more quickly.", "summary": "Scientists working in tandem with artificial intelligence (AI) could slash the time it takes to develop new drugs - and, crucially, the cost - say tech companies."}

{"id": "20217938", "article": "The \"twisted light\" approach relies on what is called light's orbital angular momentum, which has been put forth as an unexploited means to carry data.\nNow a number of researchers, including some formally commenting in New Journal of Physics, say the idea is misguided.\nResponding in the same journal, the approach's proponents insist the idea can in time massively boost data rates.\nThat promise is an enticing one for telecommunications firms that are running out of \"space\" in the electromagnetic spectrum, which is increasingly crowded with allocations for communications, broadcast media and data transmission.\nSo others are weighing in on what could be a high-stakes debate.\n\"This would be worth a Nobel prize, if they're right. Can you imagine, if all communications could be done on one frequency?\" asked Bob Nevels of Texas A&M University, a former president of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' Antennas and Propagation Society.\n\"If they've got such a great thing, why isn't everyone jumping up and down? Because we know it won't work,\" he told BBC News.\nThe disagreement in New Journal of Physics provides a window on the time-honoured practice of open debate in academic journals (as opposed to the increasingly widespread approach of debating issues before they are even formally published): a kind of \"he says, she says\" with references.\nThe principle behind the idea is fairly simple. Photons, the most basic units of light, carry two kinds of momentum, a kind of energy-of-motion.\nOne, spin angular momentum, is better known as polarisation. Photons \"wiggle\" along a particular direction, and different polarisations can be separated out by, for example, polarising sunglasses or 3D glasses.\nBut they also carry orbital angular momentum - in analogy to the Earth-Sun system, the spin angular momentum is expressed in our planet spinning around its axis, while the orbital angular momentum manifests as our revolution around the Sun.\nThe new technique aims to exploit this orbital angular momentum, essentially encoding more data as a \"twist\" in the light waves.\nThat the phenomenon exists is not in question - it has been put to use recently in studying black holes, for example.\nWhat makes the current debate devilishly complex is arguing whether experiments by Bo Thide of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and colleagues really do use and benefit from it.\nThe team has carried out very public demonstrations of the idea, sending data across a Venice lagoon in a test first described in a New Journal of Physics article. But even before that article made it to press, other researchers were questioning the approach's validity.\nIn a paper in IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, Lund University's Ove Edfors and Anders Johansson argued that what was going on was a version of \"multiple input, multiple output\" - or Mimo - data transmission, a technique first outlined in the 1970s.\n\"I've been trying to have a discussion with these guys, asking for arguments - because all the arguments they have put forward have been perfectly explainable by standard theories,\" Prof Edfors told BBC News.\n\"What I get back is 'you don't understand, you're not a physicist', and I say 'well, try to convince me'.\"\nJulien Perruisseau-Carrier at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL), and colleagues make much the same argument in their comment paper published this week. But it seems clear that the controversy arises as a conflict between the disciplines of physics and engineering.\n\"These people are physicists, they have their own research,\" Prof Perruisseau-Carrier told BBC News. \"But the authors are trying to spin off some of their work into a telecommunications issue.\n\"The fact is they didn't understand that what they were doing, as we explained, is a subset of something very well-known and documented.\"\nDetractors argue that the demonstrations so far have only used two \"modes\" to transmit information, perfectly replicating a Mimo setup - and that if Prof Thide and colleagues try to extend the work - to the promised tens or hundreds of possible modes, they will fail.\nFor his part, Prof Thide insists that it is the engineers who have misunderstood.\n\"The typical wireless engineer, even if a professor, doesn't know anything about angular momentum,\" he told BBC News.\n\"The points made by these people... are in contradiction to each and every textbook there is in electrodynamics. This is not something invented by us, something we found out on a coffee break - this is on solid theoretical foundations going back through several Nobel prizes.\"\nBut the groundswell of resistance to the technique seems to be growing. Prof Nevels and his Texas A&M colleague Laszlo Kish have published a paper in PLOS ONE that they believe is the simple, final proof of its impossibility - and more academics are signing on as co-authors.\nProf Perruisseau-Carrier says that the idea will prove itself valid or otherwise soon enough.\n\"They mentioned they have some contact with telecoms companies - we were very happy to see that. There's no doubt that as soon as they defer to a real expert, that people will notice [that the idea is flawed],\" he said.\n\"We are convinced that this will not go anywhere.\"", "summary": "An idea to vastly increase the carrying capacity of radio and light waves has been called into question."}

{"id": "37845980", "article": "But for the average backbench MP, the chance to make laws can seem a distant possibility.\nTheir best chance comes around once a year, in the form of a random ballot.\nThe prize? A chance for MPs to promote their pet project in the House of Commons by introducing it as a Private Members' Bill.\nPrivate Members' Bills can be introduced in three different ways. The first are \"Ten Minute Rule\" bills, where MPs make a speech of no more than 10 minutes to outline their position. Second are presentations to the Commons, where an MP might formally introduce the title of their bill.\nThe third and most likely to make it onto the statute book are the \"Ballot Bills\", so-called because MPs take part in a random draw to decide who gets to propose a bill in the Commons.\nThe system has its critics, among them the SNP MP who sponsored the \"Turing Bill\" to pardon gay men for obsolete sexual offences.\n\"It is absurd for legislation to be decided by the deputy speaker pulling balls out of a jar. It seems altogether too random,\" John Nicolson says.\nIf this sounds confusing, it's probably because it is.\nIn a report on Private Members' Bills, the Commons' Procedure Committee called the process \"impenetrable\" and \"enormously damaging to the reputation of the House and to the legislative process\".\nChairman of the committee, Broxbourne MP Charles Walker, says: \"One thing you have to do in this house is accept failure, but you need to have a fair crack at failure, and I don't think most backbenchers now have a fair crack at failure.\"\nEven if an MP is lucky enough to propose their Private Members' Bill to the Commons, it is far from guaranteed that it will become law.\nOpposing MPs can stop these sorts of bills progressing by \"filibustering\" or \"talking them out\" during debates held on 13 Fridays throughout the year - a process the Procedure Committee report describes as \"speaking at inordinate length on the bill to ensure that the debate cannot conclude\" before the set time limit.\nMr Nicolson's Private Members' Bill, the Sexual Offences (Pardons) Bill, fell after a government minister used up the time allotted for debating it by speaking for 25 minutes.\nThere were cries of \"shame\" and \"shameful\" from some MPs as Justice Minister Sam Gyimah's speech brought the debate to a close.\nSpeaking to the BBC Mr Nicolson said: \"I think voters consider filibustering to be wrong. And I agree with them.\n\"Filibustering is archaic, and often used to frustrate the Private Members' Bill process. If a minister doesn't talk out a bill, a hard core of obstructionist MPs often do it, talking nonsensically for lengthy periods until the time allocated for the bill is over.\"\nMr Gyimah defended his opposition to Mr Nicolson's bill, saying \"I understand and support the intentions behind Mr Nicolson's bill, however I worry that he has not fully thought through the consequences.\"\nConservative MP Philip Davies, a regular attendee of Friday debates on Private Members' Bills, mounted a passionate defence of talking out.\nSpeaking to a Procedure Committee evidence session Mr Davies said: \"I support a bill by not speaking at all, and stop a bad bill from going forward by running out of time.\n\"If the purpose of me contributing to the debate is to try to stop bills that I think are bad, this is the mechanism that I have to use, under the rules,\" he continued.\n\"If there was another mechanism of blocking them that didn't involve me speaking in the debate, the chances are that I would use that mechanism and therefore nobody would hear another point of view. You would only hear one side.\"\nMr Davies concluded: \"When we have a debate, whether people like the outcome or not, at least people get to hear that there is a different opinion on a particular bill.\"\nGreen Party co-leader Caroline Lucas had a similar experience of a bill being talked out in 2015.\nHer \"NHS Reinstatement\" bill ran out of time after MPs spent four-and-a-half hours debating the two-clause Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) bill.\nMs Lucas told the Procedure Committee the bill was one that \"certain MPs have 'on the shelf' for the purpose of clogging up Private Members' Bill time on Fridays\".\nThe Brighton Pavilion MP told the BBC: \"What really turns the public off politics is witnessing the childish way some MPs speak for a huge amount of time in order to 'talk out' bills and prevent them from being concluded and voted on.\"\nWhile talking out has many opponents, there are ways of clamping down on the practice that already exist.\nIn its recommendations for changes to the Private Members' Bill process, the Procedure Committee suggested that the Speaker and his deputies overseeing debates on them should make greater use of their existing ability to impose time limits on speeches.\nEqually, an MP sponsoring a Private Members' Bill can attempt to close a debate before it runs out of time. The problem is that to do so 100 MPs have to be present in the chamber - a requirement the committee's report called a \"a formidable hurdle\" to overcome on Fridays, when many MPs have already returned to their constituencies.\nIn the end, opponents of talking out may be disappointed, because the Procedure Committee stopped short of calling for a ban.\nWarning against applying more rules to Commons debates, the committee instead suggested limiting opportunities to indulge in the practice.\n\"The more rules there are, the greater the opportunities to game them,\" it said.", "summary": "When proposing new laws, ministers can fill the statute books from the relative safety of their positions in government."}

Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord.\nBoth Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London.\nRecords held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010.\nThe documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\".\nOperating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable.\nIn one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants.\nThe owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property.\nThe company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\".\nBut housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room.\nOne of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp.\nHe says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable.\nMr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.\n\"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\"\nNearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m.\nThe council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\".\nMatt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice.

Farmers were too poor to transport them to big cities.\nThrough United Nations workers whom he met in Rwanda, Mr Makiura decided to facilitate the transport of food between the farmers and hundreds of thousands of refugees who were fleeing the civil war in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.\nThat was less than two years ago.\nToday, he is based in Bangkok where he has started his own company.

Above all, he is not afraid to take risks. And his global vision and entrepreneurial spirit are exactly what the Japanese government wants to encourage.\nToday, Japan has one of the lowest levels of entrepreneurship in the developed world, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor.\nThere are a number of obstacles.\nJapan has long lacked venture capitalists who tend to invest in start-ups elsewhere in the world. And approaching banks for financing help, is a big challenge for entrepreneurs.\n\"I asked for funding through traditional financial institutions but they wanted to see balance sheets which we don't have,\" says Naoki Mita, who left his banking job to open detox spa Le Furo.\nMr Mita approached Mr Makiura and asked for him to be an adviser to the spa venture. And together, they managed to secure funding from investors abroad. But Mr Mita believes not many entrepreneurs would even consider raising money overseas.\n\"Thanks to my experience as an investment banker I could look outside Japan, but at home the gap between demand and supply in the capital market is severe,\" he says.\nBut the fundamental problem lies deeper in people's perspectives.\nIn a society that appreciates a conformist attitude, not following the usual path of becoming a salaryman - a company employee -  is seen as too risky or even reckless.\nThe former boss of the once high-flying internet firm, Livedoor, Takafumi Horie challenged that view in the 1990s. Instead of graduating from elite Tokyo University and looking for a job, he dropped out and started his own firm.\n\"I couldn't care less about what people thought of me,\" he tells the BBC.\n\"I had no desire to become a salaryman or wear a suit,\" adds Mr Horie, who stood out in the conservative world of corporate Japan by wearing T-shirts to business meetings.\nUnder his leadership, Livedoor grew rapidly. He also made headlines by trying to buy a baseball team and running in a parliamentary election.\nBut in 2006, Mr Horie was charged with securities fraud and imprisoned for 21 months before he was released on parole. He has maintained his innocence and accused the prosecution of targeting him for his brash, unconventional entrepreneurship.\nHis arrest became known as the \"Horie shock\" and regardless of their beliefs about his guilt, other entrepreneurs from then on kept a low profile.\nThe support for start-ups that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has announced is a turning point in people's perspectives.\nToday, there are more venture capital companies to help start-ups. The number of entrepreneurs is on the rise.\n\"What's lacking now is the true venture capitalist spirit - not just injecting capital but mentoring and helping the next generation grow,\" says special advisor to the Cabinet Office William Saito, adding that the government is trying to encourage that.\nBut Mr Makiura says many of his peers are still trying to get a job with big listed companies.\nHe says he is who he is today because when he was just 13, he decided to leave the comfort of home to study in the UK. He wanted to see the world outside Japan.\nMr Horie says the whole education system needs to change, because at the moment, it is only producing loyal soldiers who are good at following orders.\nHalf a century ago, Japan did produce a number of great entrepreneurs. They were the founders of Toyota, Sony and Honda who were unafraid to try something different.\nBut as the economy grew, Mr Saito says, the Japanese society became unforgiving towards failures, and this needs to change.\nPeople like Mr Makiura are still too rare.\nBut Japanese youths who are unafraid to take risks may be the best way to jump start the Japanese economy.", "summary": "In September 2012, 18-year-old Doga Makiura made his first trip to Rwanda, a country which many Japanese would only associate with the genocide in 1994."}

And why were they in Calais in the first place?\nThe jungle is situated at a place called Calais, which is on the north coast of France, right near to the UK.\nMany thousands of people travelled across Europe and arrived at Calais in order to try to cross the English Channel to reach the UK, where they believed they could live a better life.\nThis is because Calais is one of the main ports for travelling from France to England, with lots of vehicles, ships and trains that travel to England from here.\nHowever, the refugees were being stopped at Calais before they could complete the last part of their journey, as they are not allowed to simply enter the UK without going through an official process.\nThis means they had to set up temporary homes at Calais. As a result, the jungle had become home to thousands of people, desperate to finish their journey and make a new start in the UK.\nEarlier this year, authorities in France announced plans to close the camp and an area of it was cleared. However, the final demolition of the Jungle shelters has now been completed.\nThe authorities did this because they did not believe it was a situation people should be living in, and they needed to find a better solution.\nPeople had been living in very poor and dirty conditions. Furthermore, there were reports of violence and trouble in the camp, meaning it wasn't always a safe place for people to live.\nLocal people in Calais had also been campaigning for the Jungle to close down, as they did not want it in their area.\nMany of those living in the Jungle had been making desperate attempts to reach the UK quicker, by jumping onto lorries that are travelling to England. This is extremely dangerous and is also illegal.\nThe thousands of people who lived in the camp have been made to leave their temporary homes behind.\nThousands of migrants have been taken to official centres all over France, where the authorities say the living conditions will be better.\nOnce they arrive there, French officials will register them and decide where they will go to live after this.\nOne of the big problems which the authorities faced when trying to sort out the refugees with new homes was the fact that many children travelled across Europe - and were living in the Jungle - on their own.\nAround 270 children who have relatives in the UK - or who were considered to be particularly in need of help - have been brought over to the UK to be looked after here.", "summary": "The French authorities have been carrying out the demolition of one of the biggest refugee camps in Europe known as the \"Jungle\"."}

{"id": "35261970", "article": "Amid all the speculation, one could be forgiven for saying that only one man - David Cameron - knows when the public will be asked to vote on whether to stay in the European Union or to leave.\nAfter all, it is he - and he alone - who will make the final decision.\nBut that doesn't tell the whole truth either. The timing of the referendum hinges on when other EU leaders agree to his proposed changes to the UK's relationship with the EU, a decision which is largely out of the prime minister's hands.\nCurrent speculation is centring around June, July or September this year with few thinking it could be next year - but anything is possible.\nWhat's wrong with next year?\nMr Cameron has pledged to hold the referendum before the end of 2017. Although Downing Street has, in public, strived to appear non-committal on the timing, it is widely known it would prefer to hold the poll in 2016.\nWhy is this? 2017 is considered politically problematic for a number of reasons.\nThe UK wants to avoid a clash with elections in France and Germany in the Spring of 2017. It also wants to avoid the vote turning into a \"mid-term\" referendum on the government, where the outcome could be swayed by a range of other factors.\nThe earlier the referendum takes place, such is the received wisdom, the less chance of this happening.\nBy leaving it until 2017, David Cameron - who is likely to back continued EU membership - could be left at the mercy of events, such as a worsening of the migrant crisis in Europe that might not play well for those backing the status quo.\nWhile some argue that the date of the poll will make little difference to the ultimate outcome, there are plenty of others who believe \"going early\" will benefit the Remain campaign, while a later poll will favour the Leave campaign.\nSo, if it is going to be this year, can we narrow it down any further?\nYes, but only slightly. The PM has already ruled out holding it in the first week of May, the traditional time for elections, to avoid a clash with polls for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Stormont Parliament.\nIf he gets an agreement on his reform demands in February at a summit of EU leaders, a referendum could be held in June. But that could be tight.\nOnce an EU agreement is reached, Parliament will need to pass secondary legislation authorising the date of the referendum and other campaign-related details. This hiatus is likely to take four to six weeks.\nDavid Cameron has said he believes at least three months should then elapse before the vote is held, to ensure the campaign is fairly conducted and both sides have enough time to mobilise their resources and put forward their arguments.\nLegislation currently passing through Parliament stipulates the campaign should be no less than 10 weeks.\nThe Europe minister has hinted at a four-month campaign period while the Electoral Commission recommends a six month interval, based on previous recent referendums, but the watchdog makes it clear that this is only best practice guidance and there is no legal requirement to follow this.\nWhat about later in the year\nIf an EU-wide agreement is reached in March, and based on the assumption that the campaign lasts 10 weeks, the earliest that the poll could realistically be held is July.\nBut July is close the start of the summer holiday season - not a good time to hold an election normally. August is certainly a non-starter because half the population will be on the beach.\nSo that leaves September. This is the date currently been seen as most likely by campaigners on both sides - but it depends on Mr Cameron getting an agreement at March's EU council meeting.\nThere is recent precedent for a September referendum - the poll on Scottish independence having been held on 18 September. Elections are not normally held any later in the year because the dark nights depress turnout. October might work at a pinch, although no one mentions it as a possible date.\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage is adamant the poll will be in June but his friend and party donor Arron Banks, who is bankrolling the Leave.EU campaign - one of two rivals groups campaign for EU exit - has told the BBC that he thinks this is unlikely.\nAs they say, you pays your money and you take your chance.", "summary": "Guessing when the referendum on the UK's EU membership will be held is Westminster's current favourite parlour game."}

{"id": "32956824", "article": "Not far away, in Brooklyn Bridge Park, where once derelict piers have been converted into outdoor sports centres, the soccer pitches are usually more crowded than the basketball courts.\nA short walk down the hill, an archway under the Manhattan Bridge last summer hosted one of New York's World Cup \"viewing parties\", where thousands gathered to watch games, and not just those involving the American national team.\nSo it seemed incongruous to stand in front of the courthouse last week, fielding questions from presenters in London about why a country with no interest in football had suddenly assumed the role of global policeman of the global game.\nThat line of inquiry seemed about a decade out of date.  It is akin to the blanket condemnation that Americans lack a sense of humour or irony - this in the land of Jon Stewart, Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman and Garry Shandling.\nTrue, football, or soccer as it is known here, is not as central to American as it is to European, African or South and Central American life. Nowhere near.\nUp until recently, the game has been unloved by the major US television networks, which have long bemoaned the lack of breaks in play, the paucity of goals and the glut of draws.\nAbsent from the US game are big-name male stars and big-name clubs. The New York Red Bulls will never rival the New York Yankees. Real Salt Lake pales, rather risibly, alongside Real Madrid.\nHowever, football is no longer met with American indifference. Nor any more does it offer proof of America's sporting isolationism. In this polyglot nation, the game is growing in popularity and importance, an upward trend that will continue long into the future as America becomes less white and more Hispanic.\nAlready, America is the number one country in the world for youth participation in football. More than three million youngsters were registered to play in 2014, compared with just 103,432 in 1974.\nMajor League Soccer matches now have a higher average attendance - 19,148 in 2014 - than basketball and ice hockey. The game ranks third after American football and baseball.\nThough the crowds here are significantly smaller than in the Bundesliga in Germany, the Premier League in England and Wales, La Liga in Spain or Serie A in Italy, they are on average bigger than in Argentina, Brazil, China or the Football League Championship.\nBundesliga: 43,532\nPremier League: 36,083\nLa Liga: 26,803\nSerie A: 22,019\nMajor League Soccer (in 2014): 19,148\nThe Seattle Sounders, America's most-watched team, attracts larger crowds for home games than Everton, Tottenham, Aston Villa or even Chelsea.\nThe strength of the game in Seattle is also a measure of how its popularity extends well beyond the new immigrant hubs of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.\nSporting Kansas City, in the American heartland, is also one of the better-supported sides.\nLast year's World Cup in Brazil witnessed record viewing figures in America, even though the national team did not make it past the final 16.\nAnd even after it exited the tournament, viewers kept tuning in - 29.2 million for the final between Germany and Argentina.\nBy comparison, that year's baseball world series attracted 13.5 million.\nNor is American enthusiasm for the World Cup a new phenomenon - more than 18 million people watched the 1994 final between Brazil and Italy - but it has been growing.\nThe average viewing figure for matches in last year's World Cup matches was 4.3 million, up 50% from 2010.\nAll those kids who grew up playing the game are now, as adults, watching it.\nMore video:\nSoccer seen as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsissyball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Deep South\nWhy US soccer has no relegation\nDo Native Americans play football?\nFootball in America also transcends the gender divide.\nOf the kids playing the game, 48% are girls.\nThe USA has twice won Fifa's Women's World Cup, a record matched only by Germany.\nMia Hamm, who accumulated a staggering 275 caps and scored 158 international goals, has been called America's greatest female athlete of the past 40 years.\nIn terms of her marketability, Nike ranked her alongside Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan.\nIt is also worth remembering that one of the most sought after demographics in American politics is the country's army of suburban \"soccer moms.\"\nThe term is hardly new. It was coined in the mid-1990s.\nMoney is another indicator of the game's attractiveness.\nNBC splashed out $240m (\u00c2\u00a3160m) for the rights to Premier League football between 2013-16, three times more than Fox paid for the previous contract.\nWith a fierce bidding war now under way, the next deal is expected to dwarf that figure.\nThe wider availability of Premier League matches, which attract much bigger television audiences than domestic games, is also helping to raise the profile of the sport.\nGone are the days when diehard fans used to have to find bars open on a Saturday morning with satellite feeds beamed in from Europe.\nNow every single Premier League game is available on cable. Ditto the FA Cup and Uefa Champions League.\nOn Univision, the American Spanish language network with viewing figures on a par with the major US networks, soccer, unsurprisingly, is the number one sport. Broadcasting live matches has fuelled the channel's rapid rise.\nNo longer do foreigners have to explain the intricacies of the offside rule to perplexed locals, or why games are allowed to finish in a tie (a draw).\nMany Americans are now fully literate in the sport.\nSo while American soccer may never rival American football, the notion that it remains a niche sport is absurd.\nThough gridiron, baseball, basketball and ice hockey are known here as the \"Big Four\" sports, soccer has surely ousted ice hockey to join that quartet.\nIt is the fourth most popular high school sport for boys, and the third for girls.\nThere are many reasons why the US Department of Justice mounted these prosecutions.\nTwo of those indicted, Jeffrey Webb and Chuck Blazer, were dominant figures in the American game.\nJack Warner, of Trinidad and Tobago, used to head up Concacaf, the Miami-based Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football.\nProsecutors claim the alleged bribery scheme relied heavily on the US banking system.\nBut although the US authorities have also targeted foreign nationals, they do not regard soccer as a foreign sport.\nAnnouncing the charges, FBI director James Comey stressed how American kids and others at the grassroots had been deprived of resources.\nThe FBI has cast a global dragnet, but this is also a homeland investigation.\nThe Fifa allegations dominated the media here last week, and, paradoxically, that marks another milestone in the game's recognition.\nThe game has moved from the back pages to the front.", "summary": "Outside the courthouse in Brooklyn where the trial of the Fifa officials charged with corruption will take place is an all-weather football pitch crowded throughout the week with players of all ages."}

{"id": "32086196", "article": "Reports of a \"mass murder\" investigation in France and pictures of German policemen carting bags of evidence from his parents' home suggest that officials are determined to find out.\nBut this appears to be a case of murder-suicide, which is very different and extremely rare.\nIn these incidents, one person wishing to end their life takes the lives of others - in this case, complete strangers - at the same time.\nThe statistics show that most murder-suicides happen in domestic settings, and involve a man and his spouse.\nMurder-suicides involving pilots or in gun massacres are, in fact, much, much rarer.\nWhat drives people to these acts is therefore virtually impossible to determine because there is no common theme and the perpetrators don't leave notes explaining their actions.\nIn contrast to the motivations of a suicide bomber, which are intentionally well-publicised, those behind a murder-suicide are usually more difficult to fathom.\nNo-one, of course, can pretend to know what was in Lubitz's mind as he locked the cockpit door and instigated the plane's devastating descent.\nSimon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says it's unlikely we will ever know.\n\"It's possible something will emerge, but in most suicides people leave clues or a message.\n\"Incredibly extreme events like this are sometimes just inexplicable.\"\nDespite this, the media has been quick to point the finger at Lubitz's history of depression.\nGerman newspapers have also reported that he had received psychiatric treatment and may have been experiencing a \"personal life crisis\".\nIn reality, there is a multitude of factors, feelings and personality traits which could push someone to such an extreme course of action.\nAlcohol problems, drug misuse, broken relationships or marriages, personality disorders, work stresses - in the past or at the time of the act - can all play a part.\nMental health charities agree, and have been queuing up to plead for more understanding about depression, and less sensationalist language.\nThey say the vast majority of people with depression do not hurt anyone, and research shows that their risk is primarily to themselves.\nMarjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, says: \"There are thousands of people with a diagnosis of depression, including pilots, who work, hold positions of high responsibility and who present no danger whatsoever.\n\"We do not know what part depression played in this tragedy but it is a condition that should never be trivialised.\"\nCharities said there was a danger that mental health problems could be stigmatised by coverage of the crash, making people more afraid to talk about their experiences.\nDr Paul Keedwell, consultant psychiatrist and specialist in mood disorders, also says mental health problems are not a sufficient explanation for what happened.\n\"Among cases of murder-suicide in general, the rate of previously diagnosed depression varies from 40% to 60%, depending on the context.\"\nBut he does say that of those who are depressed, very few are being treated for it.\nIt is clear that men find it particularly difficult to seek help if they have a history of mental illness.\nIn the UK, for example, 75% of suicides are in men.\nLubitz passed the tests set by his employer which indicated he was fit to fly, but it has since come to light that he may have been hiding an illness from them.\nThis illness and his seeming inability to talk about it or come to terms with it may hold some small clue to his actions.\nBut, in reality, there is never going to be an adequate explanation for murder-suicides - particularly for the families of those killed.", "summary": "The question has been raised - is 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz a mass murderer for bringing down a plane full of passengers, killing everyone on board?"}

The same as the US, the EU or anywhere else in the world, he said.\nIn fact, EU countries couldn't even muster the pledged extra cash. It's a promise they seem unable or unwilling to keep.\nThe European Commission says it will put in \u20ac1.8bn and wants the rest of the new fund made up by individual European nations.\nSo far they've coughed up less than \u20ac80m.\nThe EU was also unable to persuade/charm - some say bully - African countries into automatically receiving deported migrants back.\nInstead, in the written summit conclusions, the EU was forced to emphasise \"voluntary repatriations\". That prompted obvious questions about the bloc's declared aim of \"speeding up the return\" of economic migrants and other failed asylum seekers - a key part of its plan to tackle the migrant crisis.\nIn short: the summit was not a resounding success.\nAnd a number of European newspapers were critical of the EU even trying to make a deal.\nGermany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the EU's offer of money to reduce the refugee numbers from Africa could open the EU to accusations of \"showing its real values by co-operating with unjust regimes\".\nSimilar objections are raised when it comes to EU attempts to strike a deal with Turkey - now the main departure point for refugees and other migrants crossing to Europe.\nEU leaders are planning a Turkey summit before the end of the year, but - as German Chancellor Angela Merkel has pointed out - \"Ankara holds the cards\".\nAnd diplomats worry that Ankara will demand an extravagant bouquet in terms of money and political concessions - such as lifting visa restrictions, and accelerating Turkey's EU membership bid - in exchange for help on migration.\nAnd again, critics challenge the EU for courting Turkey at all - a country with an imperious president and dismal human rights record.\nThere are also those who say the EU's focus is far too fixed on creating \"Fortress Europe\", on keeping people out and not on introducing legal ways for them to come to over.\nBecause come they will.\nThe European Commission expects about three million refugees and other migrants to arrive in Europe by 2017.\nClearly, whatever the EU does during this crisis, it will come under fire from some quarter or another.\nAll too often, it comes up against itself - a behemoth of 28 nations, struggling to work together.\nEven the quota system - accepted (reluctantly) by most EU countries - to share out more equally the asylum seekers in Europe is an unmitigated flop so far.\nAgreed number of people to be relocated: 160,000.\nPeople moved to date: 147.\nCross-border co-operation is disintegrating as barbed wire goes up and borders slam shut across Europe: in Slovenia, Hungary, Austria, Sweden, Norway\u2026\nEven Germany is toughening border regulations.\nIn stark contrast to the warm welcome given to hundreds or thousands earlier this autumn, Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's hugely popular finance minister, has begun to mutter darkly about a migrant \"avalanche\" engulfing his country.\nThere's little evidence of the EU - more of each country for itself.\nThat prompted the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, to warn that Schengen, the EU agreement allowing passport-free travel across much of Europe, risks collapse.
